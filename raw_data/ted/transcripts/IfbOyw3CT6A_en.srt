1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Well, it's great to be here.

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've been quite interested in both.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
If we could convert 0.03 percent

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
expensive and very inefficient.

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
There are nano-engineered designs,

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which at least have been analyzed theoretically,

11
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that show the potential to be very lightweight,

12
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
very inexpensive, very efficient,

13
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.

14
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Nano-engineered fuel cells

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
could provide the energy where it's needed.

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That's a key trend, which is decentralization,

17
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
moving from centralized nuclear power plants and

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
liquid natural gas tankers

19
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,

20
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a lot more efficient

21
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and capable and safe from disruption.

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Bono spoke very eloquently,

23
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that we have the tools, for the first time,

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.

25
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.

26
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there were 500 million people living in poverty --

28
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that number now is under 200 million.

29
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,

30
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which is a reduction of 95 percent.

31
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I did enjoy Bono's comment

32
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.

33
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,

34
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,

35
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
although we hung around Harvard Square.

36
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,

37
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.

38
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.

39
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's been a strong interest of mine,

40
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.

41
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.

42
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That invariably, the world was a different place

43
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when I would introduce a technology.

44
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And, I noticed that most inventions fail,

45
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
not because the R&D department can't get it to work --

46
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed

47
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:51,000
if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --

48
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --

49
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.

50
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,

51
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and track where technology would be at different points in time,

52
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and began to build the mathematical models of that.

53
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's kind of taken on a life of its own.

54
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data

55
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.

56
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.

57
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And if you ask me,

58
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,

59
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that's very hard to say.

60
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Will WiMax CDMA G3

61
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.

62
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But if you ask me, what will it cost

63
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for one MIPS of computing in 2010,

64
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,

65
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,

66
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it turns out that those are very predictable.

67
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves

68
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.

69
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,

70
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but there's really a theoretical reason

71
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:01,000
why technology develops in an exponential fashion.

72
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.

73
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They think they're going to continue

74
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to develop a problem

75
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
or address a problem using today's tools,

76
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
at today's pace of progress,

77
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.

78
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.

79
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We had our best Ph.D. students,

80
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
our most advanced equipment around the world,

81
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we got 1/10,000th of the project done,

82
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?

83
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And 10 years into the project,

84
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the skeptics were still going strong -- says, "You're two-thirds through this project,

85
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and you've managed to only sequence

86
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a very tiny percentage of the whole genome."

87
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But it's the nature of exponential growth

88
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.

89
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Most of the project was done in the last

90
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
few years of the project.

91
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --

92
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we sequenced SARS in 31 days.

93
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.

94
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I'm going to show you just a few examples

95
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of how pervasive this phenomena is.

96
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,

97
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is doubling every decade, according to our models.

98
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These are all logarithmic graphs,

99
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.

100
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,

101
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the first virtual-reality technology.

102
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.

103
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
If you put different communication technologies

104
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
on this logarithmic graph,

105
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
television, radio, telephone

106
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
were adopted in decades.

107
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --

108
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
were under a decade.

109
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now this is an interesting chart,

110
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and this really gets at the fundamental reason why

111
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --

112
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
accelerate.

113
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They work through interaction -- they create a capability,

114
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.

115
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So the first step in biological evolution,

116
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --

117
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
took billions of years,

118
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
but then evolution used that information-processing backbone

119
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to bring on the next stage.

120
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,

121
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.

122
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then evolution used those body plans

123
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to evolve higher cognitive functions,

124
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and biological evolution kept accelerating.

125
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.

126
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,

127
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the species that combined a cognitive function

128
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with an opposable appendage --

129
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --

130
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip

131
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and fine motor coordination,

132
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and use our mental models to actually change the world

133
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and bring on technology.

134
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,

135
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and then working through interaction,

136
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
evolution used, essentially,

137
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,

138
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which were the first steps in technological evolution.

139
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the first step took tens of thousands of years --

140
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.

141
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We always used then the latest generation of technology

142
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
to create the next generation.

143
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Printing press took a century to be adopted;

144
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.

145
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.

146
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,

147
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph

148
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that fall on that straight line."

149
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,

150
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar

151
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;

152
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
these were just lists in reference works,

153
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and I think that's what they thought the key events were

154
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in biological evolution and technological evolution.

155
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line

156
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because people do have disagreements, what the key points are,

157
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,

158
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.

159
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But you see a very clear trend.

160
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:56,000
There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.

161
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,

162
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
every year.

163
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.

164
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
A personal experience, when I was at MIT --

165
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
computer taking up about the size of this room,

166
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.

167
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,

168
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is just one example of many, because it's basically

169
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a property of the evolutionary process of technology.

170
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --

171
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --

172
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that's another exponential.

173
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,

174
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.

175
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.

176
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Moore's Law was just the last part of that,

177
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,

178
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but we had electro-mechanical calculators,

179
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,

180
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,

181
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
discreet transistors used in the first space flights

182
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and then Moore's Law.

183
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,

184
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.

185
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.

186
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.

187
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.

188
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,

189
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.

190
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law

191
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.

192
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But by the teen years,

193
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,

194
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we won't be able to shrink them any more.

195
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of

196
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.

197
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.

198
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We will go into the third dimension

199
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,

200
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.

201
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.

202
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Supercomputers -- same thing.

203
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Processor performance on Intel chips,

204
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the average price of a transistor --

205
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.

206
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You could buy 10 million in 2002.

207
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's pretty remarkable how smooth

208
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
an exponential process that is.

209
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,

210
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --

211
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
countries accusing each other of dumping products,

212
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.

213
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You would think it would be a very erratic process,

214
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and you have a very smooth

215
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
outcome of this chaotic process.

216
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Just as we can't predict

217
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
what one molecule in a gas will do --

218
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it's hopeless to predict a single molecule --

219
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,

220
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
using thermodynamics, very accurately.

221
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,

222
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but the result of this whole worldwide,

223
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:03,000
chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition

224
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.

225
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And we can predict these trends far into the future.

226
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,

227
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.

228
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
As we make them smaller and less expensive,

229
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the electrons have less distance to travel.

230
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,

231
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so the cost of a cycle of one transistor

232
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.

233
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
You add other forms of innovation and processor design,

234
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.

235
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And that's basically deflation --

236
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
50 percent deflation.

237
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;

238
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
it's true of brain scanning;

239
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,

240
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we have hundreds of different measurements

241
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of different, information-related measurements --

242
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
capacity, adoption rates --

243
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,

244
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
depending on what you're looking at.

245
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.

246
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And economists have actually started worrying about that.

247
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We had deflation during the Depression,

248
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but that was collapse of the money supply,

249
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.

250
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
This is due to greater productivity,

251
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.

252
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume

253
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."

254
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But what we're actually seeing is that

255
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we actually more than keep up with it.

256
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars

257
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in information technology over the last 50 years.

258
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.

259
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
As the price performance makes new applications feasible,

260
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
new applications come to the market.

261
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And this is a very widespread phenomena.

262
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Magnetic data storage --

263
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,

264
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.

265
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology

266
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in these information terms.

267
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We're understanding the software programs

268
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that make our body run.

269
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
These were evolved in very different times --

270
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we'd like to actually change those programs.

271
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,

272
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
basically says, "Hold onto every calorie,

273
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because the next hunting season may not work out so well."

274
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.

275
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We'd like to actually turn that program off.

276
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously

277
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.

278
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;

279
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction

280
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
without the restriction.

281
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,

282
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
felt that would be

283
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
interesting drug for the human market,

284
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and that's just one of the 30,000 genes

285
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that affect our biochemistry.

286
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people

287
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
at the age of most people at this conference, like myself,

288
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources

289
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:03,000
which were better deployed towards the children

290
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and those caring for them.

291
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So, life -- long lifespans --

292
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
like, that is to say, much more than 30 --

293
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
weren't selected for,

294
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but we are learning to actually manipulate

295
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and change these software programs

296
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
through the biotechnology revolution.

297
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:23,000
For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.

298
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy

299
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material

300
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in the right place on the chromosome.

301
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
There's actually a -- for the first time now,

302
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --

303
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:38,000
a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.

304
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.

305
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And this technology is also accelerating.

306
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,

307
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
then a penny in 2000.

308
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
It's now under a 10th of a cent.

309
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
The amount of genetic data --

310
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
basically this shows that smooth exponential growth

311
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
doubled every year,

312
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
enabling the genome project to be completed.

313
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Another major revolution: the communications revolution.

314
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;

315
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
wired, wireless is growing exponentially.

316
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,

317
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
measured many different ways.

318
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This is based on the number of hosts.

319
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology

320
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
at an exponential rate,

321
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
both wired and wireless.

322
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --

323
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
which we're now showing are feasible

324
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
with super-computing simulations,

325
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
where actually there are scientists building

326
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:37,000
molecule-scale robots.

327
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,

328
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that's built out of molecules.

329
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:46,000
There are little machines doing things in experimental bases.

330
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
The most exciting opportunity

331
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is actually to go inside the human body

332
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.

333
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And this is less futuristic than it may sound.

334
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
These things have already been done in animals.

335
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:02,000
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.

336
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They put tens of thousands of these

337
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --

338
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,

339
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and actually cures type 1 diabetes.

340
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
What you're watching is a design

341
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
of a robotic red blood cell,

342
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and it does bring up the issue that our biology

343
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
is actually very sub-optimal,

344
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.

345
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Once we understand its principles of operation,

346
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,

347
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we can actually design these things to be

348
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
thousands of times more capable.

349
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,

350
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:4,000
indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,

351
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.

352
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --

353
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.

354
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.

355
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Presumably we'll ban them,

356
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms

357
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.

358
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.

359
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
These are 2020-circa scenarios,

360
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.

361
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;

362
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
there are many experiments in animals.

363
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
There's actually one going into human trial,

364
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
so this is feasible technology.

365
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
If we come back to our exponential growth of computing,

366
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.

367
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It will intersect human intelligence

368
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
in terms of capacity in the 2020s,

369
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.

370
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Where will we get the software?

371
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,

372
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and in fact not surprisingly,

373
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

374
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And with the new generation of scanning tools,

375
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
for the first time we can actually see

376
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:52,000
individual inter-neural fibers

377
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and see them processing and signaling in real time --

378
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,

379
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but can we understand it?

380
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence

381
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:05,000
just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,

382
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,

383
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and we'd never catch up to it.

384
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:14,000
It turns out that we can understand it.

385
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:17,000
This is a block diagram of

386
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:21,000
a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex

387
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:23,000
that actually works quite well --

388
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:25,000
in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.

389
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
There's another simulation of the cerebellum --

390
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that's more than half the neurons in the brain --

391
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
again, works very similarly to human skill formation.

392
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
This is at an early stage, but you can show

393
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:42,000
with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain

394
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and the exponential improvement

395
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
in the resolution of brain scanning,

396
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain

397
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:51,000
by the 2020s.

398
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:54,000
We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions

399
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:57,000
out of the several hundred.

400
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
All of this is driving

401
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:01,000
exponentially growing economic progress.

402
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:04,000
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour

403
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
of labor in the last 50 years.

404
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:11,000
E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.

405
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:13,000
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?

406
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.

407
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,

408
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:22,000
but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,

409
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:24,000
they figured, well, that was wrong,

410
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and then we had this bust.

411
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:29,000
All right, this is a technology

412
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.

413
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:36,000
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.

414
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:38,000
It would be able to translate from one language to another.

415
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:5,000
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.

416
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:53,000
By 2010 computers will disappear.

417
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:57,000
They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.

418
0:19:57,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Images will be written directly to our retina,

419
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:01,000
providing full-immersion virtual reality,

420
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:04,000
augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.

421
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:09,000
But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,

422
0:20:09,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw

423
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:16,000
in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.

424
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power

425
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:21,000
greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth

426
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:23,000
of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.

427
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:25,000
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.

428
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:27,000
We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,

429
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:31,000
1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful

430
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:35,000
than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.

431
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:37,000
Computers will combine

432
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:39,000
the subtle pan-recognition powers

433
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:42,000
of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,

434
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:44,000
in terms of doing analytic thinking,

435
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:46,000
remembering billions of facts accurately.

436
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.

437
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:53,000
But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.

438
0:20:53,000 --> 0:20:55,000
We are going to merge with our technology.

439
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:57,000
These nano-bots I mentioned

440
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:01,000
will first be used for medical and health applications:

441
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:04,000
cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells

442
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:09,000
and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.

443
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:11,000
But they'll also go inside our brain,

444
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:13,000
interact with our biological neurons.

445
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:16,000
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.

446
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
So, for example,

447
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:2,000
full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,

448
0:21:2,000 --> 0:21:23,000
the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,

449
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:26,000
replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving

450
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
if you were in the virtual environment,

451
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.

452
0:21:3,000 --> 0:21:32,000
You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience

453
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:34,000
with anyone involving all of the senses.

454
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:38,000
"Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences

455
0:21:38,000 --> 0:21:41,000
in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.

456
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:44,000
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.

457
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:46,000
But most importantly,

458
0:21:46,000 --> 0:21:48,000
it'll be a tremendous expansion

459
0:21:48,000 --> 0:21:52,000
of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,

460
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:54,000
which in some sense we're doing already.

461
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:56,000
We routinely do intellectual feats

462
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:58,000
that would be impossible without our technology.

463
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:01,000
Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,

464
0:22:01,000 --> 0:22:06,000
and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,

465
0:22:06,000 --> 0:22:08,000
this will move up very rapidly

466
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:1,000
in the years ahead.

467
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:14,000
My main message is that progress in technology

468
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:17,000
is exponential, not linear.

469
0:22:17,000 --> 0:22:21,000
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,

470
0:22:21,000 --> 0:22:23,000
so they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years

471
0:22:23,000 --> 0:22:26,000
before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly

472
0:22:26,000 --> 0:22:28,000
or artificial intelligence."

473
0:22:28,000 --> 0:22:31,000
If you really look at the power of exponential growth,

474
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:34,000
you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.

475
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:37,000
And information technology is increasingly encompassing

476
0:22:37,000 --> 0:22:41,000
all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing

477
0:22:41,000 --> 0:22:45,000
to our biology to our energy to materials.

478
0:22:45,000 --> 0:22:48,000
We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,

479
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:5,000
from information, in very inexpensive raw materials,

480
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:53,000
using nano-technology.

481
0:22:53,000 --> 0:22:55,000
These are very powerful technologies.

482
0:22:55,000 --> 0:22:59,000
They both empower our promise and our peril.

483
0:22:59,000 --> 0:23:02,000
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.

484
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:03,000
Thank you very much.

485
0:23:03,000 --> 0:23:04,000
(Applause)

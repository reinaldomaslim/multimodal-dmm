1
0:00:12.907,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You know, it's a big privilege for me

2
0:00:15.335,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world:

3
0:00:19.227,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.

4
0:00:21.928,000 --> 0:00:24,000
These islands — Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Réunion —

5
0:00:25.673,000 --> 0:00:28,000
along with the island of Madagascar,

6
0:00:28.811,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they are blessed with unique plants

7
0:00:30.727,000 --> 0:00:32,000
found nowhere else in the world.

8
0:00:32.84,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And today I will tell you about five of them

9
0:00:35.529,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and their particular features

10
0:00:37.524,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and why these plants are so unique.

11
0:00:40.408,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Take a look at this plant.

12
0:00:41.968,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,

13
0:00:45.372,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the botanical name is Terminalia bentzoe,

14
0:00:49.298,000 --> 0:00:5,000
subspecies bentzoe.

15
0:00:51.199,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,

16
0:00:54.507,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and its particular feature

17
0:00:56.318,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is its heterophylly.

18
0:00:58.792,000 --> 0:01:,000
What do I mean by heterophylly?

19
0:01:00.918,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's that the same plant

20
0:01:02.481,000 --> 0:01:05,000
has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.

21
0:01:05.564,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, these plants have evolved

22
0:01:07.149,000 --> 0:01:09,000
very far away from the mainland,

23
0:01:09.503,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and within specific ecosystems.

24
0:01:12.901,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Often, these particular features

25
0:01:15.725,000 --> 0:01:17,000
have evolved as a response to the threat

26
0:01:18.536,000 --> 0:01:2,000
presented by the local fauna,

27
0:01:20.973,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in this case, grazing tortoises.

28
0:01:24.593,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,

29
0:01:27.749,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and as such, they tend to avoid the plants

30
0:01:30.235,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they don't recognize.

31
0:01:32.294,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant

32
0:01:35.668,000 --> 0:01:37,000
against these rather cute animals,

33
0:01:38.593,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and protects it and of course ensures its survival.

34
0:01:43.651,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now the question you're probably asking yourself is,

35
0:01:46.661,000 --> 0:01:48,000
why is she telling us all these stories?

36
0:01:49.562,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The reason for that is that we tend to overlook

37
0:01:53.248,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the diversity and the variety of the natural world.

38
0:01:57.632,000 --> 0:01:59,000
These particular habitats are unique

39
0:02:00.525,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they are host to a whole lot of plants.

40
0:02:04.753,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We don't realize how valuable

41
0:02:06.924,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and how precious these resources are,

42
0:02:09.534,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and yet, through our insouciance,

43
0:02:11.729,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we keep on destroying them.

44
0:02:13.898,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We're all familiar

45
0:02:15.63,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with the macro impact of urbanization,

46
0:02:18.825,000 --> 0:02:21,000
climate change, resource exploitation,

47
0:02:22.267,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but when that one last plant —

48
0:02:24.44,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or animal for that matter —

49
0:02:26.649,000 --> 0:02:28,000
when that very last specimen

50
0:02:28.848,000 --> 0:02:3,000
has disappeared from the face of this Earth,

51
0:02:30.959,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we would have lost

52
0:02:32.355,000 --> 0:02:35,000
an entire subset of the Earth's biology,

53
0:02:36.261,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and with it, important plants with medicinal potential

54
0:02:39.939,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or which could have ingredients

55
0:02:41.874,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that would speak to the cosmetic,

56
0:02:43.395,000 --> 0:02:44,000
nutrition, pharma,

57
0:02:45.316,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,

58
0:02:47.735,000 --> 0:02:48,000
be gone forever.

59
0:02:49.478,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And here we have a very prime example

60
0:02:51.413,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,

61
0:02:54.158,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and, of course, we know is now a symbol of extinction.

62
0:02:58.545,000 --> 0:03:,000
We know plants have a fundamental role to play.

63
0:03:01.165,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Well, first of all, they feed us

64
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and they also give us the oxygen we breathe,

65
0:03:05.89,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but plants are also the source

66
0:03:08.207,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of important, biologically active ingredients

67
0:03:11.762,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that we should be studying very carefully,

68
0:03:14.964,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because human societies over the millennia,

69
0:03:19.254,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they have developed important knowledge,

70
0:03:22.302,000 --> 0:03:23,000
cultural traditions,

71
0:03:24.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and important plant-based medicinal resources.

72
0:03:28.416,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Here's a data point:

73
0:03:30.401,000 --> 0:03:34,000
1.4 percent of the entire land surface

74
0:03:34.563,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is home to 40 percent of the species of higher plants,

75
0:03:38.467,000 --> 0:03:4,000
35 percent of the species of vertebrates,

76
0:03:41.155,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and this 1.4 percent

77
0:03:43.698,000 --> 0:03:47,000
represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,

78
0:03:48.366,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface

79
0:03:51.524,000 --> 0:03:53,000
already provides for 35 percent

80
0:03:54.406,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of the ecosystem services

81
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that vulnerable people depend on.

82
0:03:58.918,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And as you can see,

83
0:04:00.266,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the island of Mauritius

84
0:04:01.679,000 --> 0:04:03,000
where I work and where I live,

85
0:04:03.762,000 --> 0:04:05,000
belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,

86
0:04:06.467,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I study the unique plants

87
0:04:08.681,000 --> 0:04:11,000
on the island for their biomedical applications.

88
0:04:12.343,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, let's go back again

89
0:04:13.68,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to that first plant I showed you,

90
0:04:15.52,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the one, of course, with different-shaped leaves

91
0:04:18.547,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,

92
0:04:21.403,000 --> 0:04:22,000
subspecies bentzoe,

93
0:04:23.07,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a plant only found in Mauritius.

94
0:04:25.665,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, the local people,

95
0:04:27.11,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they used a decoction of the leaves

96
0:04:29.336,000 --> 0:04:31,000
against infectious diseases.

97
0:04:31.867,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now our work, that is,

98
0:04:34.319,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the scientific validation of this traditional information,

99
0:04:37.728,000 --> 0:04:39,000
has shown that precisely

100
0:04:39.8,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,

101
0:04:44.129,000 --> 0:04:46,000
against a wide range of bacteria

102
0:04:46.351,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that could be pathogenic to humans.

103
0:04:49.427,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, could this plant be the answer

104
0:04:51.868,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to antibiotic resistance?

105
0:04:54.489,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be

106
0:04:56.84,000 --> 0:04:58,000
a big challenge globally.

107
0:04:59.56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:

108
0:05:02.363,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we will not want this plant to disappear.

109
0:05:04.972,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But the harsh reality is that

110
0:05:07.616,000 --> 0:05:08,000
this particular plant is in fact

111
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:1,000
considered to be vulnerable

112
0:05:11.47,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in its natural habitat.

113
0:05:13.63,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This brings me to another example.

114
0:05:15.778,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate

115
0:05:19.568,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the local vernacular.

116
0:05:21.29,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.

117
0:05:23.945,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's a plant which is rare,

118
0:05:25.836,000 --> 0:05:27,000
which is endemic to Mauritius.

119
0:05:28.548,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It used to grow on the mainland,

120
0:05:29.77,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but through the sheer pressures of urbanization

121
0:05:32.213,000 --> 0:05:34,000
has been pushed out of the mainland,

122
0:05:34.492,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and we've managed to bring it back

123
0:05:36.193,000 --> 0:05:37,000
from the brink of extinction

124
0:05:37.669,000 --> 0:05:39,000
by developing in vitro plants

125
0:05:39.736,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which are now growing in the wild.

126
0:05:41.584,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, one thing I must point out straightaway

127
0:05:43.78,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is that not all plants

128
0:05:46.657,000 --> 0:05:48,000
can be developed in vitro.

129
0:05:49.573,000 --> 0:05:52,000
While we humans, we are happy in our comfort zone,

130
0:05:53.396,000 --> 0:05:55,000
these plants also need

131
0:05:55.632,000 --> 0:05:57,000
their ecosystem to be preserved,

132
0:05:58.366,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and they don't react — endemic plants

133
0:06:00.199,000 --> 0:06:03,000
don't react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem,

134
0:06:03.518,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and yet we know what are the challenges

135
0:06:05.779,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that climate change, for example,

136
0:06:06.867,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is posing to these plants.

137
0:06:08.91,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, the local people again use the leaves

138
0:06:11.438,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in traditional medicine

139
0:06:13.192,000 --> 0:06:15,000
against respiratory problems.

140
0:06:15.872,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, our preliminary labwork

141
0:06:17.961,000 --> 0:06:18,000
on the leaf extract has shown

142
0:06:19.693,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that precisely these leaves contain ingredients

143
0:06:23.822,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that are very close, in terms of structures,

144
0:06:26.917,000 --> 0:06:28,000
chemical structures, to those medicines

145
0:06:29.283,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which are sold in the chemist's shop

146
0:06:30.802,000 --> 0:06:31,000
against asthma.

147
0:06:32.777,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So who knows

148
0:06:34.687,000 --> 0:06:36,000
what humanity will benefit from

149
0:06:36.773,000 --> 0:06:41,000
should this plant decide to reveal all its secrets.

150
0:06:42.191,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, I come from the developing world

151
0:06:44.682,000 --> 0:06:46,000
where we are forever being challenged with this issue

152
0:06:47.485,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of population explosion.

153
0:06:49.879,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Africa is the continent which is getting younger,

154
0:06:52.693,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and whenever one talks about population explosion,

155
0:06:56.396,000 --> 0:06:58,000
one talks about the issue of food security

156
0:06:58.901,000 --> 0:07:,000
as being the other side of the same coin.

157
0:07:01.581,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now this plant here, the baobab,

158
0:07:03.899,000 --> 0:07:04,000
could be part of the answer.

159
0:07:05.421,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's an underutilized, neglected food plant.

160
0:07:08.566,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It defines the landscape of West Africa,

161
0:07:11.059,000 --> 0:07:13,000
where it is known as the tree of life,

162
0:07:13.605,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and later on I will tell you why

163
0:07:16.103,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the Africans consider it to be the tree of life.

164
0:07:19.214,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now interestingly, there are many legends

165
0:07:21.132,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which are associated with this plant.

166
0:07:23.24,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Because of its sheer size,

167
0:07:25.012,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it was meant to be lording over lesser plants,

168
0:07:27.914,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so God didn't like this arrogance,

169
0:07:29.872,000 --> 0:07:31,000
uprooted it, and planted it upside down,

170
0:07:32.66,000 --> 0:07:34,000
hence its particular shape.

171
0:07:35.182,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And if you look at this tree again

172
0:07:37.69,000 --> 0:07:39,000
within the African context,

173
0:07:39.852,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in West Africa, it's known as the palaver tree,

174
0:07:43.517,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because it performs great social functions.

175
0:07:46.587,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now if you have a problem in the community,

176
0:07:48.806,000 --> 0:07:49,000
meeting under the palaver tree

177
0:07:50.544,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with the chiefs or the tribesmen

178
0:07:52.523,000 --> 0:07:54,000
would be synonymous to trying to find a solution

179
0:07:54.685,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to that particular problem,

180
0:07:56.13,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and also to reinforce trust and respect

181
0:07:59.07,000 --> 0:08:01,000
among members of the community.

182
0:08:01.591,000 --> 0:08:03,000
From the scientific point of view,

183
0:08:03.987,000 --> 0:08:05,000
there are eight species of baobab in the world.

184
0:08:06.682,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There's one from Africa,

185
0:08:08.664,000 --> 0:08:09,000
one from Australia,

186
0:08:10.333,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and six are endemic

187
0:08:13.08,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to the island of Madagascar.

188
0:08:14.727,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The one I have showed you

189
0:08:16.359,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is the one from Africa,

190
0:08:17.949,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Adansonia digitata.

191
0:08:19.87,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Now, the flower, this beautiful white flower,

192
0:08:22.19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,

193
0:08:24.314,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and it gives rise to the fruit

194
0:08:26.913,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which is curiously known

195
0:08:28.465,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as the monkey apple.

196
0:08:30.2,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The monkeys are not stupid animals.

197
0:08:31.693,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They know what's good for them.

198
0:08:33.426,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,

199
0:08:36.227,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you'll see a white, floury pulp,

200
0:08:38.82,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is very rich in nutrients

201
0:08:40.917,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and has got protein,

202
0:08:43.291,000 --> 0:08:47,000
more protein than in human milk.

203
0:08:47.409,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Yes, you heard right:

204
0:08:49.197,000 --> 0:08:52,000
more protein than in human milk.

205
0:08:52.605,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And this is one of the reasons why

206
0:08:54.495,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the nutrition companies of this world,

207
0:08:56.317,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they are looking for this fruit to provide

208
0:08:58.702,000 --> 0:09:,000
what we know as reinforced food.

209
0:09:01.289,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil

210
0:09:05.17,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is sought after by the cosmetic industry

211
0:09:08.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to give to produce body lotions, for example.

212
0:09:11.502,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And if you look at the trunk,

213
0:09:13.131,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the trunk, of course, safeguards water,

214
0:09:16.734,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,

215
0:09:19.535,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and the leaves are used in traditional medicine

216
0:09:21.213,000 --> 0:09:22,000
against infectious disease.

217
0:09:23.168,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it

218
0:09:25.744,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to be the tree of life.

219
0:09:27.544,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It's a complete plant,

220
0:09:29.209,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and in fact, the sheer size of these trees

221
0:09:31.751,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is hiding a massive potential,

222
0:09:33.854,000 --> 0:09:36,000
not only for the pharma, nutrition, and the cosmetic industry.

223
0:09:37.296,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What I have showed you here

224
0:09:39.302,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is only the species from Africa,

225
0:09:41.532,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Adansonia digitata.

226
0:09:43.416,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We have six species yet in Madagascar,

227
0:09:46.08,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and we don't know what is the potential of this plant,

228
0:09:49.564,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but one thing we know is that the flora

229
0:09:52.03,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is considered to be threatened with extinction.

230
0:09:54.592,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Let me take you to Africa again,

231
0:09:57.796,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and introduce you to one of my very favorite,

232
0:10:00.3,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the resurrection plant.

233
0:10:02.13,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now here you'll find

234
0:10:03.477,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that even Jesus has competition.

235
0:10:05.395,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

236
0:10:06.998,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, this plant here has developed

237
0:10:09.991,000 --> 0:10:11,000
remarkable tolerance to drought,

238
0:10:12.97,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which enables it to withstand

239
0:10:15.068,000 --> 0:10:19,000
up to 98 percent dehydration over the period of a year

240
0:10:19.313,000 --> 0:10:21,000
without damage,

241
0:10:21.417,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and yet it can regenerate itself almost completely

242
0:10:25.567,000 --> 0:10:29,000
overnight, over 24 hours, and flower.

243
0:10:29.647,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, us human beings,

244
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.

245
0:10:35.106,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We don't want to get old, and rightly so.

246
0:10:36.94,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Why should we, especially if you can afford it?

247
0:10:40.179,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And this gives you an indication

248
0:10:42.362,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of what the plant looks like before.

249
0:10:45.164,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener,

250
0:10:48.02,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the first thing you'll do when you visit the garden

251
0:10:50.052,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is to uproot this plant because it's dead.

252
0:10:52.776,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But if you water it, this is what you get.

253
0:10:57.578,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Absolutely amazing.

254
0:10:59.754,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, if you look at our aging process,

255
0:11:02.25,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the aging process is in fact the loss of water

256
0:11:04.7,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling

257
0:11:07.874,000 --> 0:11:08,000
as we know it, especially women,

258
0:11:09.441,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we are so conscious of this.

259
0:11:11.282,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And this plant, in fact, is giving the cosmetic chemists

260
0:11:15.963,000 --> 0:11:16,000
very important ingredients

261
0:11:17.953,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that are actually finding ways

262
0:11:20.72,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to slow down the aging process

263
0:11:23.11,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and at the same time reinforce the cells

264
0:11:25.49,000 --> 0:11:29,000
against the onslaught of environmental toxins.

265
0:11:29.777,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Now, these four examples

266
0:11:32.414,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I have just given you

267
0:11:35.321,000 --> 0:11:38,000
are just a very tiny reminder

268
0:11:38.755,000 --> 0:11:41,000
as to how our health

269
0:11:42.492,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and our survival are closely linked

270
0:11:45.996,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to the health and the resilience

271
0:11:48.808,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of our ecosystem,

272
0:11:50.653,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and why we should be very careful

273
0:11:52.587,000 --> 0:11:54,000
about preserving biodiversity.

274
0:11:55.288,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Every time a forest is cut down,

275
0:11:58.49,000 --> 0:12:01,000
every time a marsh is filled in,

276
0:12:02.11,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it is a potential lab that goes with it,

277
0:12:05.86,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and which we will never, ever recover.

278
0:12:08.168,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And I know what I'm talking about,

279
0:12:09.735,000 --> 0:12:12,000
coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.

280
0:12:13.067,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Let me finish with just one last example.

281
0:12:17.425,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Conservation issues are normally guided

282
0:12:21.24,000 --> 0:12:23,000
towards rare, endemic plants,

283
0:12:24.208,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but what we call exotic plants,

284
0:12:26.75,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that is, the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world,

285
0:12:30.227,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they also need to be considered.

286
0:12:32.633,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You know why? Because the environment plays

287
0:12:35.772,000 --> 0:12:36,000
a very important role

288
0:12:37.527,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in modifying the composition of that plant.

289
0:12:40.186,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So let's take a look at this plant here,

290
0:12:42.817,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Centella asiatica. It's a weed.

291
0:12:45.3,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We call it a weed.

292
0:12:47.448,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Now, Centella asiatica grows across the world

293
0:12:50.324,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in many different habitats — in Africa, in Asia —

294
0:12:53.106,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and this plant has been instrumental

295
0:12:55.125,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in providing a solution to that dreadful disease

296
0:12:57.892,000 --> 0:13:01,000
called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.

297
0:13:02.338,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now, while Centella grows across the world —

298
0:13:05.868,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in Africa, in Asia — the best quality Centella

299
0:13:09.159,000 --> 0:13:11,000
comes from Madagascar,

300
0:13:11.503,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because that Centella contains the three vital ingredients

301
0:13:15.688,000 --> 0:13:17,000
which are sought after by the pharma

302
0:13:17.914,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and the cosmetic companies.

303
0:13:20.548,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And the cosmetic companies are already using it

304
0:13:22.797,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to make regenerating cream.

305
0:13:25.879,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Now, there is an ancient saying

306
0:13:28.668,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that for every disease known to mankind,

307
0:13:32.212,000 --> 0:13:34,000
there is a plant to cure it.

308
0:13:34.394,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now, you may not believe in ancient sayings.

309
0:13:36.622,000 --> 0:13:37,000
You may think they're obsolete

310
0:13:38.185,000 --> 0:13:4,000
now that our science and technology are so powerful.

311
0:13:41.133,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So you may look on Centella as being

312
0:13:43.169,000 --> 0:13:46,000
an insignificant, humble weed,

313
0:13:46.374,000 --> 0:13:49,000
which, if destroyed, won't be missed.

314
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But you know, there is no such thing as a weed.

315
0:13:52.135,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's a plant.

316
0:13:53.889,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It's a living biological lab

317
0:13:56.768,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that may well have answers

318
0:13:58.669,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to the question that we may have,

319
0:14:00.627,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but we have to ensure

320
0:14:02.517,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that it has the right to live.

321
0:14:05.25,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thank you.

322
0:14:07.128,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

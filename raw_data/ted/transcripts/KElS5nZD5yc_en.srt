1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, these are

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the Dark Ages.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And the Dark Ages are the time between

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when you put away the LEGO

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for the last time as a kid,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Started out with my then four-year-old:

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Oh, should buy the kid some LEGO.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That stuff's cool."

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Walked into the LEGO store.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Bought him this.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I think the box says --

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
let's see here --

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"8 to 12" on it.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The dining room looked like this.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You walk there, and it hurts.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So we took a room downstairs in the basement

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Torture, very funny.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Wow, you guys are great.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we put down those little floor tiles,

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and then I went onto eBay

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and bought 150 pounds of LEGO --

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which is insane.

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I said,

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Honey, you're my treasure."

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And she said, "No, the LEGO is the treasure."

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And then she said, "Dad, we're LEGO rich."

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was like, "Yeah.

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I suppose we are."

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So then once you do that

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So you go to The Container Store

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and spend an enormous amount of money,

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and then you start this crazy sorting process

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that never --

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it's just nuts.

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Whatever.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So then you realize there are these conventions.

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And you're like, "Holy shit!

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He had to come in like a truck,

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a semi, with this thing."

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Just beautiful.

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And there's a dude selling these

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
aftermarket weapons for LEGO,

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because LEGO -- the Danish --

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
no, they're not into guns.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for LEGO, no problem.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And at a certain point, you look around,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but that's like a couple of levels above furries.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The nerds here, they get laid --

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and you say to yourself at some point,

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I'm coming out.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So then you really get into it,

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and you're like, "Well, the LEGO people in Denmark, they've got all this software

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to let you build your own virtually."

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And then whatever you design virtually,

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And then some of the designs that people do

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
they actually sell in the store.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The LEGO guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but some user made this and then it sold.

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And it's pretty amazing actually.

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Then you notice that if that

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
LEGO-provided CAD program isn't enough,

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
there's an entire open-source, third-party,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
independent LEGO CAD program

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that lets you do 3D modeling

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and 3D rendering

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and make, in fact, movies out of LEGO,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
3D films

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of which there are thousands on YouTube,

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and some of them sort of mimicking famous films

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and some totally original content --

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
just beautiful --

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and people recreating all sorts of things.

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I have to take a moment.

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I love the guy who's like running away

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
with his clasps, his hooks.

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Okay. Anyway.

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There's a whole programming language and robotics tool,

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so if you want to teach someone how to program,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
kid, adult, whatever it is.

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And the guy that made this,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
he made a slot machine out of LEGO.

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I don't mean he made LEGO that looked like a slot machine;

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I mean he made a slot machine out of LEGO.

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The insides were LEGO.

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
There's people getting drunk building LEGO,

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There's a whole gray market for LEGO,

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
thousands of home-based businesses.

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And some people will fund their entire LEGO habit

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
by selling the little guy,

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but then you have no guys in your ships.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is amazing what you can do.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And don't kid yourself:

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
some architectural details, incredible organic shapes

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is my house.

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this is my house.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
as I was taking a picture for you guys.

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Anyway, I'm out of time.

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But just very quickly --

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we'll just see if I can do this quick.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Let's see here.

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Okay.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Ta-da.

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today I want to talk to you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about ethnic conflict

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and civil war.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
nor do they generally generate

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the kind of good news

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that this conference is about.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Yet, not only is there at least some good news

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to be told about fewer such conflicts now

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
than two decades ago,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but what is perhaps more important

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is that we also have come

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to a much better understanding of what can be done

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to further reduce the number

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of ethnic conflicts and civil wars

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the suffering that they inflict.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Three things stand out:

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
leadership, diplomacy

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and institutional design.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What I will focus on in my talk

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is why they matter, how they matter,

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and what we can all do

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to make sure that they continue to matter

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in the right ways,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that is, how all of us can contribute

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to developing and honing the skills

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of local and global leaders

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to make peace

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and to make it last.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But let's start at the beginning.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Civil wars have made news headlines

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for many decades now,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and ethnic conflicts in particular

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
have been a near constant presence

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as a major international security threat.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
For nearly two decades now,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the news has been bad

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and the images have been haunting.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In Georgia, after years of stalemate,

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in August, 2008.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
This quickly escalated into a five-day war

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
between Russia and Georgia,

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
leaving Georgia ever more divided.

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we just heard about them --

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
quickly led to high levels

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of inter-ethnic violence

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the killing and displacement

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of thousands of people.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In Sri Lanka,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a decades-long civil war

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
between the Tamil minority

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the Sinhala majority

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
led to a bloody climax in 2009,

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
after perhaps as many as 100,000

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
people had been killed

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
since 1983.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
unprecedented levels of violence occurred

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
between ethnic Kyrgyz

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and ethnic Uzbeks.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Hundreds have been killed,

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and more than 100,000 displaced,

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
including many ethnic Uzbeks

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
In the Middle East,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
continues unabated,

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it becomes ever more difficult

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to see how, just how

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a possible, sustainable solution

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
can be achieved.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but the killing and displacement there

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
continues as well,

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the sheer human misery that it creates

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is very hard to fathom.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in Iraq, finally,

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
violence is on the rise again,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and the country has yet to form a government

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
four months after

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
its last parliamentary elections.

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So are these now the images of the past?

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from the Middle East, Darfur,

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Iraq, elsewhere,

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
there is a longer-term trend

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that does represent some good news.

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
there has been an overall decline

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the number of civil wars.

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Since the high in the early 1990s,

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we now have 30 percent fewer

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
such conflicts today.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The number of people killed in civil wars

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
also is much lower today

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
than it was a decade ago or two.

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But this trend is less unambiguous.

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
was recorded between 1998 and 2001,

104
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
killed every year.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The lowest number of combatant casualties

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
occurred in 2003,

108
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with just 20,000 killed.

109
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Despite the up and down since then,

110
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the overall trend --

111
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and this is the important bit --

112
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
clearly points downward

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for the past two decades.

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The news about civilian casualties

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is also less bad than it used to be.

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
From over 12,000 civilians

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
deliberately killed in civil wars

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in 1997 and 1998,

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
a decade later,

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
this figure stands at 4,000.

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is a decrease by two-thirds.

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This decline would be even more obvious

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda

124
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in 1994.

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered

126
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in a matter of just a few months.

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This certainly is an accomplishment

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that must never be surpassed.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What is also important is to note

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that these figures only tell part of the story.

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They exclude people

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that died as a consequence of civil war,

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
from hunger or disease, for example.

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And they also do not properly account

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
for civilian suffering more generally.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
have become highly effective,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
To put it differently,

140
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for the civilians that suffer the consequences

141
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of ethnic conflict and civil war,

142
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there is no good war

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and there is no bad peace.

144
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Thus, even though every civilian killed,

145
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the fact that the number

147
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of civilian casualties

148
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is clearly lower today

149
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
than it was a decade ago,

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is good news.

151
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, we have fewer conflicts today

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in which fewer people get killed.

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And the big question, of course,

154
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is why?

155
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In some cases,

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
there is a military victory of one side.

157
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is a solution of sorts,

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but rarely is it one

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that comes without human costs

160
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or humanitarian consequences.

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
is perhaps the most recent example of this,

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but we have seen similar

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so-called military solutions

165
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus

166
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and across most of Africa.

167
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
At times, they are complimented

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
by negotiated settlements,

169
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or at least cease-fire agreements,

170
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and peacekeepers are deployed.

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But hardly ever do they represent

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
a resounding success --

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Bosnia and Herzegovina

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
perhaps more so than Georgia.

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But for many parts of Africa,

176
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
a colleague of mine once put it this way,

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"The cease-fire on Tuesday night

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was reached just in time

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But let's look at the good news again.

181
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If there's no solution on the battlefield,

182
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
three factors can account

183
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,

184
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or for sustainable peace afterwards:

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
leadership, diplomacy

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and institutional design.

187
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Take the example of Northern Ireland.

188
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Despite centuries of animosity,

189
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
decades of violence

190
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and thousands of people killed,

191
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
1998 saw the conclusion

192
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of an historic agreement.

193
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Its initial version was skillfully mediated

194
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
by Senator George Mitchell.

195
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Crucially, for the long-term success

196
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
of the peace process in Northern Ireland,

197
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
he imposed very clear conditions

198
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
for the participation and negotiations.

199
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Central among them,

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a commitment

201
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to exclusively peaceful means.

202
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Subsequent revisions of the agreement

203
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,

204
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who never wavered in their determination

205
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.

206
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The core institutions

207
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that were put in place in 1998

208
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and their modifications

209
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in 2006 and 2008

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
were highly innovative

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and allowed all conflict parties

212
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to see their core concerns and demands addressed.

213
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement

214
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in Northern Ireland

215
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
with cross-border institutions

216
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that link Belfast and Dublin

217
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and thus recognizes

218
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.

219
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And significantly,

220
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
there's also a clear focus

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
on both the rights of individuals

222
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the rights of communities.

223
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The provisions in the agreement may be complex,

224
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but so is the underlying conflict.

225
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Perhaps most importantly,

226
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,

227
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
not always fast

228
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and not always enthusiastically,

229
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but rise in the end they did.

230
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Who ever could have imagined

231
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness

232
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
jointly governing Northern Ireland

233
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
as First and Deputy First Minister?

234
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,

235
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or does this kind of explanation

236
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
only hold more generally

237
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in democratic and developed countries?

238
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
By no means.

239
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war

240
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in 2003

241
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
illustrates the importance

242
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of leadership, diplomacy

243
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and institutional design

244
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
as much as the successful prevention

245
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of a full-scale civil war

246
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in Macedonia in 2001,

247
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or the successful ending

248
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.

249
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In all three cases,

250
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
local leaders were willing and able

251
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to make peace,

252
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the international community stood ready

253
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,

254
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and the institutions have lived up

255
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to the promise that they held

256
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
on the day they were agreed.

257
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Focusing on leadership, diplomacy

258
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and institutional design

259
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
also helps explain failures to achieve peace,

260
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or to make it last.

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords

262
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
did not lead to an end

263
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

264
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved

265
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
were actually covered in the agreements.

266
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Rather, local leaders committed

267
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to revisiting them later on.

268
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,

269
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
local and international leaders

270
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
soon disengaged

271
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and became distracted

272
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11

273
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
signed in 2005

276
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,

277
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and its provisions may yet bear the seeds

278
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of a full-scale return to war

279
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
between north and south.

280
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Changes and shortcomings in leadership,

281
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
more off than on international diplomacy

282
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and institutional failures

283
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
account for this

284
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
in almost equal measure.

285
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,

286
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the ongoing conflict in Darfur,

287
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
escalating tribal violence in the south

288
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and generally weak state capacity

289
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
across all of Sudan

290
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
complete a very depressing picture

291
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the state of affairs

292
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in Africa's largest country.

293
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
A final example: Kosovo.

294
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The failure to achieve

295
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a negotiated solution for Kosovo

296
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and the violence, tension

297
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and de facto partition that resulted from it

298
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
have their reasons

299
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in many, many different factors.

300
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Central among them are three.

301
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
First, the intransigence of local leaders

302
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to settle for nothing less

303
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
than their maximum demands.

304
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Second, an international diplomatic effort

305
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that was hampered from the beginning

306
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
by Western support for Kosovo's independence.

307
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And third, a lack of imagination

308
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
when it came to designing institutions

309
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that could have addressed the concerns

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of Serbs and Albanians alike.

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
By the same token --

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and here we have some good news again --

313
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the very fact that there is a high-level,

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
well-resourced international presence

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
in Kosovo

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and the Balkans region more generally

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and the fact that local leaders on both sides

318
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
have showed relative restraint,

319
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
explains why things have not been worse

320
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
over the past two years since 2008.

321
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So even in situations

322
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
where outcomes are less than optimal,

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
local leaders

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and international leaders have a choice,

325
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and they can make a difference for the better.

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
A cold war

327
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is not as good

328
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as a cold peace,

329
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but a cold peace

330
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is still better than a hot war.

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Good news is also about learning the right lesson.

332
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So what then distinguishes

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict

334
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
from that in Northern Ireland,

335
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
or the civil war in Sudan

336
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
from that in Liberia?

337
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Both successes and failures

338
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
teach us several critically important things

339
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we need to bear in mind

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
if we want the good news to continue.

341
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
First, leadership.

342
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
are not natural

344
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
but man-made disasters,

345
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
their prevention and settlement

346
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
does not happen automatically either.

347
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Leadership needs to be capable,

348
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
determined and visionary

349
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in its commitment to peace.

350
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Leaders need to connect to each other

351
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and to their followers,

352
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and they need to bring them along

353
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
on what is an often arduous journey

354
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
into a peaceful future.

355
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Second, diplomacy.

356
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,

357
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
sustained,

358
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures

359
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
on leaders and followers.

360
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,

361
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and it needs to ensure

362
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that a broad coalition

363
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
of local, regional

364
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and international supporters

365
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
help them implement their agreement.

366
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Third, institutional design.

367
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Institutional design requires

368
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
a keen focus on issues,

369
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
innovative thinking

370
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and flexible and well-funded implementation.

371
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Conflict parties need to move away

372
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
from maximum demands

373
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and towards a compromise

374
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that recognizes each other's needs.

375
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And they need to think

376
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
about the substance of their agreement

377
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
much more than about

378
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the labels they want to attach to them.

379
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Conflict parties also need to be prepared

380
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to return to the negotiation table

381
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
if the agreement implementation stalls.

382
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
For me personally,

383
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the most critical lesson of all is this:

384
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Local commitment to peace

385
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
is all-important,

386
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but it is often not enough

387
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to prevent or end violence.

388
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Yet, no amount of diplomacy

389
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
or institutional design

390
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
can make up for local failures

391
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and the consequences that they have.

392
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Therefore, we must invest

393
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
in developing leaders,

394
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
leaders that have the skills,

395
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
vision and determination

396
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
to make peace.

397
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Leaders, in other words,

398
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that people will trust

399
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and that they will want to follow

400
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
even if that means

401
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
making hard choices.

402
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
A final thought:

403
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Ending civil wars

404
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
is a process that is fraught with dangers,

405
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
frustrations and setbacks.

406
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
It often takes a generation to accomplish,

407
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
but it also requires us, today's generation,

408
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
to take responsibility

409
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and to learn the right lessons

410
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
about leadership, diplomacy

411
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and institutional design,

412
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
so that the child soldiers of today

413
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
can become the children of tomorrow.

414
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

415
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

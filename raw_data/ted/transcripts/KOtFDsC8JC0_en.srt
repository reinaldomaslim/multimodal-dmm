1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A girl I've never met before

2
0:00:15.84,000 --> 0:00:18,000
changed my life and the life of thousands of other people.

3
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.

4
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people.

5
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States.

6
0:00:29.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And we're not homophobic.

7
0:00:31.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it's true -- the way we communicate with young people is by text,

9
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because that's how young people communicate.

10
0:00:40.48,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,

11
0:00:44.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries,

12
0:00:47.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound.

13
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And we'll text them.

14
0:00:54.48,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.

15
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.

18
0:01:08.56,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is big scale. OK --

19
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:13.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But there's one weird side effect.

21
0:01:15.84,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Every time we send out a text message,

22
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter

23
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or hunger or senior citizens --

24
0:01:26.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but text messages about being bullied,

25
0:01:29.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
text messages about being addicted to pot.

26
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And the worst message we ever got said exactly this:

27
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"He won't stop raping me.

28
0:01:40.72,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's my dad.

29
0:01:43.04,000 --> 0:01:46,000
He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?"

30
0:01:50.238,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We couldn't believe this was happening.

31
0:01:52.12,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being,

32
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate, so personal.

33
0:02:00.48,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And we realized we had to stop triaging this

34
0:02:02.76,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain.

35
0:02:07.96,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So we launched Crisis Text Line,

36
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:16,000
very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market.

37
0:02:16.48,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America.

38
0:02:21.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Just to put that into perspective,

39
0:02:22.883,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.

40
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Applause)

41
0:02:31.08,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Text is unbelievably private.

42
0:02:33.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
No one hears you talking.

43
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So we spike everyday at lunch time --

44
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
kids are sitting at the lunch table

45
0:02:39.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall,

46
0:02:42.24,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but she's actually texting us about her bulimia.

47
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.

48
0:02:49.08,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We just get facts.

49
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We get things like, "I want to die.

50
0:02:55.84,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me."

51
0:02:59.2,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And so the crisis counselor says,

52
0:03:01.32,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?"

53
0:03:05.84,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And they go back and forth for a while.

54
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address,

55
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because if you're texting a text line, you want help.

56
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So she gets the address

57
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and the counselor triggers an active rescue

58
0:03:17.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
while they're texting back and forth.

59
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And then it goes quiet --

60
0:03:23.24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
23 minutes with no response from this girl.

61
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And the next message that comes in says --

62
0:03:31.64,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it's the mom --

63
0:03:33.28,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"I had no idea, and I was in the house,

64
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital."

65
0:03:40.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
As a mom that one just --

66
0:03:44.76,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The next message comes a month later.

67
0:03:47.28,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"I just got out of the hospital.

68
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK."

69
0:03:53.44,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange,

71
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day.

72
0:04:05.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression -- huge.

73
0:04:10.76,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line

74
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is that these are strangers counseling other strangers

75
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
on the most intimate issues,

76
0:04:19.24,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and getting them from hot moments to cold moments.

77
0:04:21.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's exciting, and I will tell you

78
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that we have done a total of more than 6.5 million text messages

79
0:04:28.24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in less than two years.

80
0:04:29.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Applause)

81
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this,

82
0:04:37.8,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the thing that really gets me psyched is the data:

83
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:42,000
6.5 million messages --

84
0:04:43.04,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus.

85
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We can do things like predictive work.

86
0:04:50.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set.

87
0:04:55.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So we can be better, and the world can be better.

88
0:04:58.68,000 --> 0:05:,000
So how do we use the data to make us better?

89
0:05:01.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Alright, chances are someone here, someone watching this

90
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:07,000
has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life --

91
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you do not have to raise your hand.

92
0:05:09.771,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:11.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
How do you know that person's any good?

94
0:05:13.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Oh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall?

95
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?

96
0:05:18.651,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor,

98
0:05:22.32,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I thought she was a genius when she said,

99
0:05:24.297,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"I'll see you guys in two weeks -- but I need to see you next week, sir."

100
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We have the data to know what makes a great counselor.

102
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve,"

103
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
there's a 99 percent match for cutting.

104
0:05:41.84,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We know that if you text in the words "mg" and "rubber band,"

105
0:05:46.68,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there's a 99 percent match for substance abuse.

106
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we know that if you text in "sex," "oral" and "Mormon,"

107
0:05:56.12,000 --> 0:05:57,000
you're questioning if you're gay.

108
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out

109
0:06:02.68,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says,

110
0:06:06.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"99 percent match for cutting -- try asking one of these questions"

111
0:06:11.24,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to prompt the counselor.

112
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Or "99 percent match for substance abuse,

113
0:06:15.4,000 --> 0:06:18,000
here are three drug clinics near the texter."

114
0:06:19.56,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It makes us more accurate.

115
0:06:22.24,000 --> 0:06:24,000
On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide,

116
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
people flooded hotlines all over this country.

117
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide,

118
0:06:31.56,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country.

119
0:06:35.28,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We had a spike in volume also.

120
0:06:37.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The difference was

121
0:06:38.92,000 --> 0:06:41,000
if you text us, "I want to die," or "I want to kill myself,"

122
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the algorithm reads that, you're code orange,

123
0:06:46.36,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and you become number one in the queue.

124
0:06:48.56,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So we can handle severity, not chronological.

125
0:06:51.68,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

126
0:06:56.84,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This data is also making the world better

127
0:06:59.2,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises.

128
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Think about it:

129
0:07:05.96,000 --> 0:07:09,000
those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes,

130
0:07:10.36,000 --> 0:07:11,000
all of these data points --

131
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday.

132
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am.

133
0:07:22.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit

134
0:07:25.36,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but you do not want to live there,

135
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation.

136
0:07:31.92,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And we've made this data public and free and open.

137
0:07:35.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We've pulled all the personally identifiable information.

138
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org.

139
0:07:42.24,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Because I want schools to be able to see

140
0:07:47.6,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders,

141
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so that they can plan meals

142
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays.

143
0:07:54.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am.

144
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana.

145
0:08:03.96,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Applause)

146
0:08:06.04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Data, evidence

147
0:08:08.96,000 --> 0:08:1,000
makes policy, research,

148
0:08:11.08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
journalism, policing, school boards -- everything better.

149
0:08:15.28,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I don't think of myself as a mental health activist.

150
0:08:18.68,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I think of myself as a national health activist.

151
0:08:22.84,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy.

152
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Yeah, that sounded too girly.

153
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'm nerdy.

154
0:08:29.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:31.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I love data.

156
0:08:34.12,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road

157
0:08:39.84,000 --> 0:08:41,000
with their fat-funded companies,

158
0:08:41.88,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,

159
0:08:47.72,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately,

160
0:08:51.76,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or swipe right and get laid.

161
0:08:53.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I'm inspired --

162
0:08:55.039,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter, applause)

163
0:09:00.84,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place.

164
0:09:05.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I want to use it to help that girl,

165
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who texted in about being raped by her father.

166
0:09:09.8,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Because the truth is we never heard from her again.

167
0:09:12.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy,

168
0:09:17.04,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and I hope that she sees this talk

169
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and she knows that her desperation

170
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line

171
0:09:25.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and inspires me every freaking day.

172
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause)

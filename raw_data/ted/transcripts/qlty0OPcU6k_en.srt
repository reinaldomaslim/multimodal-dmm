1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I only have three minutes

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that got me thinking.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I've had some time to think it over.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And energy efficiency is more than just

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
about the vehicle --

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it's also about the road.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of which there are two types: signalized

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Roundabouts are much better.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
A study of 24 intersections

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
has found crashes drop 40 percent

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
fatal crashes down 90 percent.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
But that's just safety.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What about time and gas?

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
less time wasted,

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
than we have in the United States.

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, unsignalized intersections,

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They're expensive to install,

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But they are not applicable in all situations.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on the minor road entering the major.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But the other two are somewhat questionable.

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Cars rarely appear on that third road.

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
cars per day in each direction,

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that's $51,000 per year.

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
wear on the car, and time.

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
What's that time worth?

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
just for that sign in each direction.

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Discount that back to the present, at five percent:

57
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
over two million dollars

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
for a stop sign, in each direction.

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you could actually buy the property,

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and then sell it off again.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And you'd still come out ahead.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The answer is to enable cars

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to come in from that side road safely.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Stop signs were invented in 1915,

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So, why not use a yield sign?

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of alternating, or taking turns,

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and it's always on the minor road,

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
allowing the major one to have primacy.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That would not work.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So, what the world needs now

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is a new type of sign.

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Applause)

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And uncertainty results in caution.

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they slow down.

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But you all are members of communities,

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and you can exercise your community influence

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to create more sensible traffic flows.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And you can have more impact on the environment

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
just getting your neighborhood to change these things

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

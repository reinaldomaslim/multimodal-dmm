1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to talk to you today a little bit

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about predictable irrationality.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And my interest in irrational behavior

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
started many years ago in the hospital.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was burned very badly.

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.

10
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and you must have wondered what's the right approach.

12
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --

13
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --

14
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --

15
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which one of those is the right approach?

16
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach

17
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,

18
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they would grab hold and they would rip.

19
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.

20
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And as you can imagine,

21
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.

22
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I would try to reason with them and say,

23
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Why don't we try something else?

24
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Why don't we take it a little longer --

25
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"

26
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And the nurses told me two things.

27
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They told me that they had the right model of the patient --

28
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --

29
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean

30
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to make suggestions or to interfere or ...

31
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.

32
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.

33
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do,

34
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they kept on doing what they were doing.

35
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And about three years later, when I left the hospital,

36
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I started studying at the university.

37
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned

38
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
was that there is an experimental method

39
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question

40
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,

41
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
maybe learn something about the world.

42
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So that's what I did.

43
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I was still interested

44
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.

45
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So originally I didn't have much money,

46
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.

47
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and I would crunch it a little bit.

49
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,

51
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and pain that went up and pain that went down,

52
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.

53
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,

54
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?

55
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Or, if you had to choose between the last two,

56
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which one would you choose?

57
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I kept on doing this for a while.

59
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.

61
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --

62
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.

63
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But at the end of this process,

64
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.

65
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here were wonderful people with good intentions

66
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and plenty of experience, and nevertheless

67
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.

68
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It turns out that because we don't encode duration

69
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in the way that we encode intensity,

70
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer

71
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and the intensity was lower.

72
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,

73
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,

74
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
giving me a trend of improvement over time --

75
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that would have been also less painful.

76
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
And it also turns out that it would have been good

77
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.

78
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
All of these would have been great things to do,

79
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and my nurses had no idea.

80
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And from that point on I started thinking,

81
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong

82
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?

83
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it turns out it's a more general case --

84
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
there's a lot of mistakes we do.

85
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,

86
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and I want to talk to you about cheating.

87
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,

88
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but also it tells us something, I think,

89
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
about the stock market situation we're in.

90
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, my interest in cheating started

91
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,

92
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I started thinking about what is happening here.

93
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Is it the case that there was kind of

94
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a few apples who are capable of doing these things,

95
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or are we talking a more endemic situation,

96
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?

97
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.

98
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And here's how it went.

99
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper

100
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,

101
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but I wouldn't give you enough time.

102
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

103
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."

104
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --

105
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
on average people would solve four problems.

106
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Other people I would tempt to cheat.

107
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I would pass their sheet of paper.

108
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

109
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"Please shred the piece of paper.

110
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,

111
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and tell me how many questions you got correctly."

112
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
People now solved seven questions on average.

113
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --

114
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
a few people cheated a lot.

115
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.

116
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, in economic theory,

117
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.

118
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You say, what's the probability of being caught?

119
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?

120
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?

121
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And you weigh these options out --

122
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,

123
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.

124
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So, we try to test this.

125
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --

126
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
how much money they could steal.

127
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,

128
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.

129
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,

130
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.

131
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.

132
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
What about the probability of being caught?

133
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,

134
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so there was some evidence left.

135
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.

136
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,

137
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.

138
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,

139
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.

140
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,

141
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.

142
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So we said, "If people are not sensitive

143
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,

144
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what could be going on?"

145
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.

146
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror

147
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.

148
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,

149
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and still feel good about ourselves.

150
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So, maybe what is happening is that

151
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
there's a level of cheating we can't go over,

152
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,

153
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.

154
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We call this like a personal fudge factor.

155
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?

156
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?

157
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So, we got people to the lab, and we said,

158
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"We have two tasks for you today."

159
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
First, we asked half the people

160
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to recall either 10 books they read in high school,

161
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
or to recall The Ten Commandments,

162
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and then we tempted them with cheating.

163
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --

164
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --

165
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,

166
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.

167
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It wasn't that the more religious people --

168
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,

169
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the less religious people --

170
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --

171
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
cheated more.

172
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,

173
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they stopped cheating.

174
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists

175
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,

176
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they don't cheat at all.

177
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard

178
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to bring into the education system, so we said,

179
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"

180
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So, we got people to sign,

181
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."

182
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.

183
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And this is particularly interesting,

184
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because MIT doesn't have an honor code.

185
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.

187
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What about increasing the fudge factor?

188
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT

189
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --

190
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.

191
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I came back to measure what we technically call

192
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?

193
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.

194
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,

195
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.

196
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
No bill ever disappeared.

197
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, this is not a good social science experiment,

198
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so to do it better I did the same experiment

199
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as I described to you before.

200
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.

201
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,

202
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they came to us and said,

203
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."

204
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,

205
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they came to us and said,

206
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."

207
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.

208
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,

209
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and exchanged it for dollars.

210
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Think about the following intuition.

211
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,

212
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
compared to how bad would you feel

213
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?

214
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
These things feel very differently.

215
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds

216
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
by being paid by token make a difference?

217
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Our subjects doubled their cheating.

218
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I'll tell you what I think

219
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
about this and the stock market in a minute.

220
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,

221
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because in Enron, there's also a social element.

222
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
People see each other behaving.

223
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
In fact, every day when we open the news

224
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we see examples of people cheating.

225
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What does this cause us?

226
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So, we did another experiment.

227
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,

228
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we prepaid them.

229
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,

230
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and we told them that at the end, we asked them

231
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?

232
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The same thing happens.

233
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.

234
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.

235
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.

236
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,

237
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"I solved everything. What do I do now?"

238
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.

239
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That's it. The task is finished."

240
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So, now we had a student -- an acting student --

241
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that was a part of the group.

242
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Nobody knew it was an actor.

243
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.

244
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What would happen to the other people in the group?

245
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?

246
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Here is what happens.

247
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.

248
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Here is the thing.

249
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.

250
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,

251
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.

252
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment

253
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
were Carnegie Mellon students.

254
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --

255
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --

256
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.

257
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,

258
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
cheating went down.

259
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

260
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now, this is important, because remember,

261
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
when the moment the student stood up,

262
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,

263
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because the experimenter said,

264
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.

265
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.

266
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It was about the norms for cheating.

267
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,

268
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.

269
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --

270
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I mean, not terrible in this --

271
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,

272
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
from another university, another group,

273
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --

274
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --

275
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and people cheat even less.

276
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?

277
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.

278
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
They cheat just by a little bit.

279
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.

280
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
When we get bigger distance from cheating,

281
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.

282
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And when we see cheating around us,

283
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.

284
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,

285
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
think about what happens.

286
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What happens in a situation when you create something

287
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
where you pay people a lot of money

288
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to see reality in a slightly distorted way?

289
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Would they not be able to see it this way?

290
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Of course they would.

291
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
What happens when you do other things,

292
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
like you remove things from money?

293
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,

294
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
mortgage-backed securities.

295
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Could it be that with those more distant things,

296
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it's not a token for one second,

297
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
it's something that is many steps removed from money

298
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?

299
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And what happens to the social environment

300
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
when people see other people behave around them?

301
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way

302
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in the stock market.

303
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
More generally, I want to tell you something

304
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
about behavioral economics.

305
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
We have many intuitions in our life,

306
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.

307
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?

308
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition

309
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in our private life, in our business life,

310
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and most particularly when it goes to policy,

311
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,

312
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --

313
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
taxation, health care and so on.

314
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And the difficulty of testing our intuition

315
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
was the big lesson I learned

316
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.

317
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So I went back to talk to them

318
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.

319
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And I learned two interesting things.

320
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,

321
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.

322
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.

323
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
But think about me as a nurse,

324
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,

325
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.

326
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."

327
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.

328
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,

329
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
"I did not think that your intuition was right.

330
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I felt my intuition was correct."

331
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So, if you think about all of your intuitions,

332
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.

333
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --

334
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
she thought her intuition was right --

335
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment

336
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to try and check whether she was wrong.

337
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.

338
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --

339
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
our own ability, how the economy works,

340
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
how we should pay school teachers.

341
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But unless we start testing those intuitions,

342
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
we're not going to do better.

343
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And just think about how better my life would have been

344
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,

345
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and how everything would have been better

346
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.

347
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.888,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's a big question at the center of life

2
0:00:15.046,000 --> 0:00:16,000
in our democracies today:

3
0:00:16.984,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How do we fight terror without destroying democracies,

4
0:00:20.353,000 --> 0:00:22,000
without trampling human rights?

5
0:00:23.594,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've spent much of my career working with journalists,

6
0:00:28.213,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with bloggers,

7
0:00:29.395,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with activists,

8
0:00:30.733,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with human rights researchers all around the world,

9
0:00:33.372,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I've come to the conclusion

10
0:00:35.506,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that if our democratic societies do not double down

11
0:00:40.175,000 --> 0:00:42,000
on protecting and defending human rights,

12
0:00:43.182,000 --> 0:00:44,000
freedom of the press

13
0:00:44.606,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and a free and open internet,

14
0:00:47.932,000 --> 0:00:52,000
radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist.

15
0:00:54.537,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Applause)

16
0:00:57.006,000 --> 0:00:58,000
OK, all done. Thank you very much.

17
0:00:58.714,000 --> 0:00:59,000
No, just joking.

18
0:00:59.897,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:01.716,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I actually want to drill down on this a little bit.

20
0:01:04.965,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So, one of the countries that has been on the frontlines of this issue

21
0:01:10.736,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is Tunisia,

22
0:01:12.325,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which was the only country to come out of the Arab Spring

23
0:01:15.865,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with a successful democratic revolution.

24
0:01:18.967,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Five years later,

25
0:01:20.256,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they're struggling with serious terror attacks

26
0:01:23.116,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and rampant ISIS recruitment.

27
0:01:25.853,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And many Tunisians are calling on their government

28
0:01:28.661,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

29
0:01:32.686,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari

30
0:01:35.738,000 --> 0:01:39,000
has summed up the situation with this character who says,

31
0:01:40.037,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"I don't give a damn about human rights.

32
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I don't give a damn about the revolution.

33
0:01:45.515,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I don't give a damn about democracy and liberty.

34
0:01:49.587,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I just want to be safe."

35
0:01:53.672,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Satisfied?" asked his jailer.

36
0:01:56.896,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"You're safe now."

37
0:01:58.941,000 --> 0:02:,000
If the Tunisian people can figure out

38
0:02:01.72,000 --> 0:02:03,000
how to deal with their terrorism problem

39
0:02:03.807,000 --> 0:02:05,000
without ending up in this place,

40
0:02:06.771,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they will be a model not only for their region,

41
0:02:09.478,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but for all of us.

42
0:02:12.402,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The reality is that civil society, journalists and activists

43
0:02:16.462,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand,

44
0:02:21.315,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and, in many countries,

45
0:02:23.069,000 --> 0:02:25,000
also from their own governments.

46
0:02:25.528,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed,

47
0:02:28.944,000 --> 0:02:29,000
charged and intimidated

48
0:02:30.406,000 --> 0:02:31,000
by their own governments,

49
0:02:31.948,000 --> 0:02:34,000
many of which are allies with the West in the war on terror.

50
0:02:35.785,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Just three examples.

51
0:02:37.446,000 --> 0:02:38,000
A friend and former colleague of mine,

52
0:02:39.326,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Hisham Almiraat,

53
0:02:40.582,000 --> 0:02:43,000
has been charged with threatening state security,

54
0:02:43.65,000 --> 0:02:45,000
along with six other activists in Morocco.

55
0:02:47.144,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi has been jailed and flogged

56
0:02:51.641,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for insulting Islam and criticizing the Saudi regime on his blog.

57
0:02:57.437,000 --> 0:03:02,000
More recently, the Turkish representative for Reporters Without Borders,

58
0:03:02.951,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Erol Önderoglu,

59
0:03:04.822,000 --> 0:03:08,000
has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda,

60
0:03:09.59,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because he and some other activists have been supporting Kurdish media.

61
0:03:15.025,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Anti-terror measures quickly turn into state repression

62
0:03:18.736,000 --> 0:03:21,000
without strong protection for minority communities

63
0:03:22.297,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and for peaceful debate;

64
0:03:24.729,000 --> 0:03:28,000
this needs to be supported by a robust, independent local media.

65
0:03:29.749,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But while that's not really happening,

66
0:03:32.077,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Washington is teaming up with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood

67
0:03:36.701,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to pour millions -- hundreds of millions of dollars --

68
0:03:41.101,000 --> 0:03:43,000
into what's called "counter-messaging,"

69
0:03:43.712,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a fancy word for propaganda.

70
0:03:46.154,000 --> 0:03:51,000
To counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet,

71
0:03:52.614,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in Europe, Internet Referral Units are being set up,

72
0:03:56.384,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so that people can report on extremist content that they find

73
0:04:00.385,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and get it censored.

74
0:04:02.191,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The problem is,

75
0:04:03.575,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that all of this propaganda, monitoring and censorship

76
0:04:08.204,000 --> 0:04:12,000
completely fails to make up for the fact

77
0:04:13.236,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that the people who are the most credible voices,

78
0:04:18.334,000 --> 0:04:22,000
who can present credible ideas and alternative solutions

79
0:04:22.443,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to real economic, social and political problems in their community

80
0:04:26.568,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that are causing people to turn to extremism in the first place,

81
0:04:30.875,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are being silenced by their own governments.

82
0:04:34.214,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world.

83
0:04:39.801,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Freedom House,

84
0:04:41.001,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the human rights organization,

85
0:04:43.055,000 --> 0:04:47,000
reports that 2015 marks the 10th straight year in a row

86
0:04:47.415,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of decline in freedom worldwide.

87
0:04:50.495,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And this is not just because of the actions

88
0:04:52.915,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of authoritarian governments.

89
0:04:54.97,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's also because democratic governments

90
0:04:57.491,000 --> 0:05:01,000
are increasingly cracking down on dissenters,

91
0:05:01.818,000 --> 0:05:02,000
whistle-blowers

92
0:05:03.01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and investigative journalists.

93
0:05:04.947,000 --> 0:05:06,000
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has warned

94
0:05:07.405,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that "preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand-in-hand."

95
0:05:11.866,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's not to say that governments shouldn't keep us safe --

96
0:05:14.694,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of course they should --

97
0:05:15.869,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but we need public oversight, transparency

98
0:05:18.488,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and accountability to the rule of law.

99
0:05:20.753,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Meanwhile,

100
0:05:21.929,000 --> 0:05:24,000
extremists are literally killing off civil society in some countries.

101
0:05:26.198,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Since 2013 in Bangladesh,

102
0:05:28.756,000 --> 0:05:32,000
over a dozen secular bloggers and community activists

103
0:05:33.296,000 --> 0:05:35,000
have been literally slaughtered by extremists

104
0:05:36.253,000 --> 0:05:38,000
while the government has done very little.

105
0:05:39.008,000 --> 0:05:41,000
From the city of Raqqa in Syria,

106
0:05:41.979,000 --> 0:05:45,000
people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf have been assassinated

107
0:05:46.579,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for their reporting out of ISIS-controlled territory.

108
0:05:50.315,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The citizen media group called Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently

109
0:05:55.923,000 --> 0:05:59,000
relies on strong encryption to send out their reports

110
0:06:00.166,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and shield themselves from interception and surveillance.

111
0:06:04.057,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Yet authorities in countries like the United States,

112
0:06:06.831,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the United Kingdom and many other democracies

113
0:06:09.398,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are seeking to use the law

114
0:06:11.275,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption,

115
0:06:15.756,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because the bad guys are using it, too.

116
0:06:18.465,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption.

117
0:06:22.749,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Otherwise, dissent and investigative journalism

118
0:06:26.403,000 --> 0:06:28,000
are going to become even more difficult

119
0:06:28.826,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in even more places.

120
0:06:30.654,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And the bad guys -- the criminals and terrorists --

121
0:06:33.149,000 --> 0:06:35,000
are still going to find ways to communicate.

122
0:06:35.433,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Kudos to the companies that are standing up

123
0:06:38.096,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for their users' right to use encryption.

124
0:06:41.595,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But when it comes to censorship,

125
0:06:43.885,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the picture is much more troubling.

126
0:06:46.61,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Yes, there's a real problem

127
0:06:48.452,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of extremist content spreading all over the internet.

128
0:06:51.739,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are among the many companies

129
0:06:55.296,000 --> 0:06:59,000
who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content

130
0:06:59.747,000 --> 0:07:,000
and deactivating accounts

131
0:07:01.351,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that are connected to the extremist's speech.

132
0:07:03.855,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box,

133
0:07:08.199,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and there is collateral damage.

134
0:07:10.211,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,

135
0:07:13.516,000 --> 0:07:15,000
an activist who makes fun of ISIS on Twitter.

136
0:07:16.176,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He had his account deactivated,

137
0:07:18.016,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because he shares a surname with a prominent ISIS leader.

138
0:07:22.22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Last December,

139
0:07:23.395,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a number of women named Isis,

140
0:07:25.038,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which also happens to be the name of an Egyptian goddess,

141
0:07:28.514,000 --> 0:07:29,000
had their accounts deactivated.

142
0:07:30.742,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And this woman,

143
0:07:32.382,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who lives in the United States and is a computer programmer,

144
0:07:35.511,000 --> 0:07:38,000
reported on Twitter about her deactivation on Facebook,

145
0:07:39.261,000 --> 0:07:42,000
managed to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated.

146
0:07:42.978,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But that's the thing -- she had to get media attention.

147
0:07:46.02,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And journalists aren't immune.

148
0:07:47.553,000 --> 0:07:48,000
David Thomson,

149
0:07:48.751,000 --> 0:07:51,000
an expert on terrorism and reporter for Radio France International,

150
0:07:52.173,000 --> 0:07:55,000
had reports deleted from his Facebook account

151
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and had his account deactivated for several days,

152
0:07:58.573,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because they contained pictures of ISIS flags,

153
0:08:02.498,000 --> 0:08:04,000
even though he was just reporting on ISIS,

154
0:08:04.578,000 --> 0:08:05,000
not promoting it.

155
0:08:06.253,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then we have stories from people like this Egyptian man,

156
0:08:09.266,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Ahmed Abdellahy,

157
0:08:10.907,000 --> 0:08:15,000
who reported recently in an event in Washington DC

158
0:08:16.074,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that some of his arguments with extremists --

159
0:08:18.272,000 --> 0:08:24,000
he now spends his time on social media arguing with ISIS followers,

160
0:08:24.609,000 --> 0:08:26,000
trying to get them to turn away --

161
0:08:27.141,000 --> 0:08:31,000
some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted,

162
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which he believes has the effect of shielding them

163
0:08:35.231,000 --> 0:08:36,000
from alternative points of view.

164
0:08:38.217,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's unclear whether Facebook even knows the extent

165
0:08:42.626,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of the collateral damage,

166
0:08:44.162,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or the other companies as well.

167
0:08:46.558,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But we do know that journalism, activism and public debate

168
0:08:50.196,000 --> 0:08:54,000
are being silenced in the effort to stamp out extremist speech.

169
0:08:55.398,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So with these companies having so much power over the public discourse,

170
0:08:59.663,000 --> 0:09:,000
they need to be held accountable.

171
0:09:01.281,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They need to carry out impact assessment

172
0:09:04.186,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to identify and fix the problems that we're clearly seeing.

173
0:09:08.727,000 --> 0:09:11,000
They need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms,

174
0:09:12.527,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanisms,

175
0:09:15.953,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so people can get their content reinstated.

176
0:09:18.64,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now, I've been talking for the last 10 minutes

177
0:09:21.857,000 --> 0:09:25,000
about how governments and companies are making it more difficult

178
0:09:25.996,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for people like these.

179
0:09:27.356,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This is a picture of members of the citizen media network,

180
0:09:30.863,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Global Voices,

181
0:09:32.038,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago

182
0:09:34.155,000 --> 0:09:35,000
with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.

183
0:09:36.175,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Interestingly, about 5 years ago, right after the Arab Spring,

184
0:09:40.669,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the data scientist Gilad Lotan

185
0:09:43.35,000 --> 0:09:47,000
created a network map of the people in Global Voices

186
0:09:48.291,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who were heavy users of Twitter during the Arab Spring.

187
0:09:51.237,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And he found that many of these people served as key information nodes

188
0:09:56.479,000 --> 0:09:57,000
between activists and journalists

189
0:09:58.367,000 --> 0:10:01,000
throughout the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution.

190
0:10:01.416,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We've got to make sure that these people not only survive,

191
0:10:06.706,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but are able to continue to thrive.

192
0:10:09.216,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Many of them are still active,

193
0:10:10.894,000 --> 0:10:12,000
other than the ones who have gone to jail

194
0:10:12.994,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or have been driven into hiding or exile.

195
0:10:16.668,000 --> 0:10:17,000
All around the world,

196
0:10:18.51,000 --> 0:10:21,000
people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression

197
0:10:21.851,000 --> 0:10:24,000
are linking up in their communities and across borders.

198
0:10:25.325,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies

199
0:10:29.612,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to do a better job of protecting their rights.

200
0:10:32.572,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We've also got to be more mindful

201
0:10:34.581,000 --> 0:10:38,000
about how our own personal, political, consumer and business choices

202
0:10:39.45,000 --> 0:10:41,000
affect people like these around the world.

203
0:10:43.112,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Also, if you follow the news,

204
0:10:45.568,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it's pretty clear that that alone isn't going to be enough.

205
0:10:49.694,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We've got to take personal responsibility by joining --

206
0:10:53.478,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or at very least, actively supporting --

207
0:10:56.919,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the growing ecosystem of individuals and groups

208
0:11:00.464,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who are fighting for social justice,

209
0:11:02.574,000 --> 0:11:04,000
environmental sustainability,

210
0:11:04.661,000 --> 0:11:05,000
government accountability,

211
0:11:06.248,000 --> 0:11:07,000
human rights, freedom of the press

212
0:11:08.149,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and a free and open internet,

213
0:11:09.729,000 --> 0:11:1,000
all around the world.

214
0:11:11.509,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I believe that, ultimately, we can overcome

215
0:11:16.244,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the digitally empowered networks of extremism, demagoguery and hate.

216
0:11:23.379,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But ...

217
0:11:25.104,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we've got to do this by really beefing up the global networks

218
0:11:31.852,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of citizens around the world,

219
0:11:33.664,000 --> 0:11:36,000
powered by people who are working hard every day,

220
0:11:37.468,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and taking personal risk

221
0:11:39.714,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for a future world that is more peaceful, just, open and free.

222
0:11:45.541,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thanks very much for listening.

223
0:11:47.094,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.794,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to tell you a story about Manson.

2
0:00:17.214,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Manson was this 28-year-old interior designer,

3
0:00:21.331,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a father to a loving daughter,

4
0:00:23.572,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and a son

5
0:00:25.675,000 --> 0:00:28,000
who found himself behind bars due to a broken-down judicial system.

6
0:00:30.516,000 --> 0:00:33,000
He was framed for a murder he didn't commit

7
0:00:33.752,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and was sentenced to the gallows.

8
0:00:36.855,000 --> 0:00:4,000
There were two victims of this murder -- the victim who actually died in the murder

9
0:00:40.895,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and Manson, who had been sentenced to prison

10
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for an offense which he did not commit.

11
0:00:47.419,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He was locked up in a cell, eight by seven,

12
0:00:49.815,000 --> 0:00:5,000
with 13 other grown-up men

13
0:00:52.262,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for 23 and a half hours a day.

14
0:00:55.188,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.

15
0:00:59.688,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I remember yesterday,

16
0:01:00.973,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as I walked into the room where I was,

17
0:01:04.07,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I imagined the kind of cell that Manson would have been living in.

18
0:01:07.434,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Because the toilet --

19
0:01:09.371,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The row of the small rooms

20
0:01:10.704,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that were there were slightly bigger than the eight-by-seven cell.

21
0:01:14.551,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But being in that cell as he awaited the executioner --

22
0:01:17.17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because in prison, he did not have a name --

23
0:01:20.292,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Manson was known by a number.

24
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He was just a statistic.

25
0:01:25.751,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He did not know how long he would wait.

26
0:01:28.323,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The wait could have been a minute,

27
0:01:30.101,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the executioner could have come the next minute,

28
0:01:32.395,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the next day,

29
0:01:33.792,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or it could have taken 30 years.

30
0:01:37.511,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The wait had no end.

31
0:01:40.194,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And in the midst of the excruciating pain,

32
0:01:43.099,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the mental torture,

33
0:01:46.061,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the many unanswered questions that Manson faced,

34
0:01:50.411,000 --> 0:01:52,000
he knew he was not going to play the victim.

35
0:01:53.331,000 --> 0:01:55,000
He refused to play the role of the victim.

36
0:01:56.497,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He was angry at the justice system that had put him behind bars.

37
0:02:01.188,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But he knew the only way he could change that justice system

38
0:02:04.141,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or help other people get justice

39
0:02:06.378,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was not to play the victim.

40
0:02:09.435,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Change came to Manson when he decided to embrace forgiveness

41
0:02:13.697,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for those who had put him in prison.

42
0:02:17.784,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I speak that as a fact.

43
0:02:20.776,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Because I know who Manson is.

44
0:02:24.403,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I am Manson.

45
0:02:26.546,000 --> 0:02:28,000
My real name is Peter Manson Ouko.

46
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And after my conviction,

47
0:02:31.807,000 --> 0:02:33,000
after that awakening of forgiveness,

48
0:02:35.318,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I had this move

49
0:02:37.826,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to help change the system.

50
0:02:40.318,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I already decided I was not going to be a victim anymore.

51
0:02:44.276,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But how was I going to help change a system

52
0:02:46.609,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that was bringing in younger inmates every day

53
0:02:49.744,000 --> 0:02:5,000
who deserve to be with their families?

54
0:02:52.862,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So I started mobilizing my colleagues in prison, my fellow inmates,

55
0:02:56.743,000 --> 0:03:,000
to write letters and memoranda to the justice system,

56
0:03:00.974,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to the Judicial Service Commission,

57
0:03:03.125,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the numerous task forces that had been set up

58
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in our country, Kenya,

59
0:03:07.958,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to help change the constitution.

60
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And we decided to grasp at those --

61
0:03:12.823,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to clutch at those straws, if I may use that word --

62
0:03:15.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if only to make the justice system work,

63
0:03:18.379,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and work for all.

64
0:03:21.029,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Just about the same time,

65
0:03:22.99,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I met a young university graduate from the UK,

66
0:03:25.839,000 --> 0:03:26,000
called Alexander McLean.

67
0:03:28.228,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Alexander had come in with three or four of his colleagues from university

68
0:03:31.737,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in their gap year,

69
0:03:32.927,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they wanted to help assist,

70
0:03:35.284,000 --> 0:03:38,000
set up a library in Kamiti Maximum Prison,

71
0:03:38.394,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which if you Google,

72
0:03:39.57,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you will see is written as one of the 15 worst prisons in the world.

73
0:03:43.784,000 --> 0:03:44,000
That was then.

74
0:03:45.307,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But when Alexander came in,

75
0:03:46.784,000 --> 0:03:47,000
he was a young 20-year-old boy.

76
0:03:48.704,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I was on death row at that time.

77
0:03:51.696,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And we took him under our wing.

78
0:03:53.53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It was an honest trust issue.

79
0:03:56.323,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He trusted us, even though we were on death row.

80
0:03:59.157,000 --> 0:04:,000
And through that trust,

81
0:04:00.426,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we saw him and his colleagues from the university

82
0:04:03.046,000 --> 0:04:06,000
refurbish the library with the latest technology

83
0:04:06.705,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and set up the infirmary to very good standards

84
0:04:10.673,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so that those of us falling sick in prison

85
0:04:13.482,000 --> 0:04:15,000
would not necessarily have to die in indignity.

86
0:04:17.95,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Having met Alexander,

87
0:04:20.188,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I had a chance,

88
0:04:21.371,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he gave me the opportunity and the support,

89
0:04:24.807,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to enroll for a university degree at the University of London.

90
0:04:28.958,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Just like Mandela studied from South Africa,

91
0:04:31.363,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I had a chance to study at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.

92
0:04:35.498,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And two years later,

93
0:04:37.188,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I became the first graduate of the program

94
0:04:39.72,000 --> 0:04:42,000
from the University of London from within the prison system.

95
0:04:44.744,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Having graduated, what happened next --

96
0:04:46.688,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

97
0:04:50.217,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Thank you.

98
0:04:51.391,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

99
0:04:52.498,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Having graduated,

100
0:04:54.014,000 --> 0:04:55,000
now I felt empowered.

101
0:04:56.014,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I was not going to play the helpless victim.

102
0:04:58.823,000 --> 0:05:,000
But I felt empowered not only to assist myself,

103
0:05:01.601,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to prosecute my own case,

104
0:05:03.474,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but also to assist the other inmates

105
0:05:06.553,000 --> 0:05:09,000
who are suffering the similar injustices that have just been spoken about here.

106
0:05:11.49,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I started writing legal briefs for them.

107
0:05:13.911,000 --> 0:05:16,000
With my other colleagues in prison, we did as much as we could.

108
0:05:19.743,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That wasn't enough.

109
0:05:23.022,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Alexander McLean

110
0:05:24.958,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and his team at the African Prisons Project

111
0:05:28.712,000 --> 0:05:29,000
decided to support more inmates.

112
0:05:30.919,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And as I'm speaking to you today,

113
0:05:32.561,000 --> 0:05:36,000
there are 63 inmates and staff in the Kenya Prison Service

114
0:05:36.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
studying law at the University of London through distance learning.

115
0:05:40.903,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These are changemakers who are being motivated

117
0:05:49.736,000 --> 0:05:52,000
not only to assist the most indolent in society,

118
0:05:52.903,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but also to help the inmates and others get access to justice.

119
0:05:59.125,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Down there in my prison cell, something kept stirring me.

120
0:06:03.584,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The words of Martin Luther King kept hitting me.

121
0:06:07.822,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And he was always telling me, "Pete, if you can't fly,

122
0:06:12.37,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you can run.

123
0:06:14.395,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And if you can't run,

124
0:06:16.284,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you can walk.

125
0:06:18.133,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But if you can't walk,

126
0:06:20.149,000 --> 0:06:21,000
then you can crawl.

127
0:06:22.331,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But whatever it is, whatever it takes,

128
0:06:24.617,000 --> 0:06:25,000
just keep on moving."

129
0:06:26.831,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so I had this urge to keep moving.

130
0:06:29.196,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I still have this urge to keep moving in whatever I do.

131
0:06:31.974,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Because I feel the only way we can change our society,

132
0:06:35.442,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the only way we can change the justice system --

133
0:06:37.742,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which has really improved in our country --

134
0:06:39.775,000 --> 0:06:4,000
is to help get the systems right.

135
0:06:42.3,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, on 26th October last year, after 18 years in prison,

136
0:06:47.482,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I walked out of prison on presidential pardon.

137
0:06:51.061,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I'm now focused on helping APP -- the African Prisons Project --

138
0:06:54.331,000 --> 0:06:57,000
achieve its mandate of training and setting up

139
0:06:57.416,000 --> 0:07:,000
the first law school and legal college behind bars.

140
0:07:01.569,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Where we are going to train --

141
0:07:03.03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

142
0:07:06.966,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Where we are going to train inmates and staff

143
0:07:10.514,000 --> 0:07:12,000
not only to assist their fellow inmates,

144
0:07:12.815,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but to assist the entire wider society of the poor

145
0:07:15.934,000 --> 0:07:17,000
who cannot access legal justice.

146
0:07:19.18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So as I speak before you today,

147
0:07:21.627,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I stand here in the full knowledge that we can all reexamine ourselves,

148
0:07:27.222,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we can all reexamine our situations,

149
0:07:30.008,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we can all reexamine our circumstances

150
0:07:33.959,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and not play the victim narrative.

151
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The victim narrative will not take us anywhere.

152
0:07:40.149,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I was behind bars, yeah.

153
0:07:42.958,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.

154
0:07:48.236,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The basic thing I got to learn

155
0:07:50.585,000 --> 0:07:52,000
was that if I thought,

156
0:07:52.887,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and if you think, you can,

157
0:07:55.093,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you will.

158
0:07:56.601,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But if you sit thinking that you can't,

159
0:07:59.37,000 --> 0:08:,000
you won't.

160
0:08:01.593,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's as simple as that.

161
0:08:04.259,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And so I'm encouraged by the peaceful revolutionaries

162
0:08:06.784,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I've heard on this stage.

163
0:08:08.633,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The world needs you now, the world needs you today.

164
0:08:12.394,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And as I finish my talk,

165
0:08:15.006,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I'd just like to ask each and every single one of you here,

166
0:08:19.744,000 --> 0:08:22,000
wonderful thinkers, changemakers, innovators,

167
0:08:23.649,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the wonderful global citizens we have at TED,

168
0:08:26.776,000 --> 0:08:28,000
just remember the words of Martin Luther King.

169
0:08:29.958,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Let them continue ringing in your heart and your life.

170
0:08:33.252,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Whatever it is,

171
0:08:35.059,000 --> 0:08:36,000
wherever you are,

172
0:08:36.709,000 --> 0:08:37,000
whatever it takes,

173
0:08:38.416,000 --> 0:08:39,000
keep on moving.

174
0:08:39.591,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Thank you.

175
0:08:40.774,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

176
0:08:44.175,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Thank you.

177
0:08:45.35,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.719,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Everyone needs a coach.

3
0:00:15.612,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,

4
0:00:18.713,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a tennis player, a gymnast

5
0:00:21.991,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or a bridge player.

6
0:00:24.212,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:26.701,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
says there are more pictures of the back of her head

9
0:00:31.415,000 --> 0:00:34,000
than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)

10
0:00:34.932,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Sorry, Sharon. Here you go.

11
0:00:38.594,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We all need people who will give us feedback.

12
0:00:42.185,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's how we improve.

13
0:00:44.422,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Unfortunately, there's one group of people

14
0:00:47.402,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who get almost no systematic feedback

15
0:00:50.208,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to help them do their jobs better,

16
0:00:52.393,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and these people

17
0:00:53.792,000 --> 0:00:56,000
have one of the most important jobs in the world.

18
0:00:56.942,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'm talking about teachers.

19
0:00:59.171,000 --> 0:01:,000
When Melinda and I learned

20
0:01:01.11,000 --> 0:01:04,000
how little useful feedback most teachers get,

21
0:01:04.322,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we were blown away.

22
0:01:06.276,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers

23
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
just got one word of feedback:

24
0:01:13.053,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Satisfactory.

25
0:01:15.773,000 --> 0:01:17,000
If all my bridge coach ever told me

26
0:01:18.266,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was that I was "satisfactory,"

27
0:01:20.651,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I would have no hope of ever getting better.

28
0:01:23.428,000 --> 0:01:26,000
How would I know who was the best?

29
0:01:26.726,000 --> 0:01:29,000
How would I know what I was doing differently?

30
0:01:30.326,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Today, districts are revamping

31
0:01:32.71,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the way they evaluate teachers,

32
0:01:34.994,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but we still give them almost no feedback

33
0:01:38.303,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that actually helps them improve their practice.

34
0:01:41.476,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Our teachers deserve better.

35
0:01:44.808,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The system we have today isn't fair to them.

36
0:01:48.036,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's not fair to students,

37
0:01:49.857,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.

38
0:01:54.887,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers

39
0:01:58.346,000 --> 0:02:02,000
get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.

40
0:02:02.604,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Let's start by asking who's doing well.

41
0:02:06.47,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables

42
0:02:09.938,000 --> 0:02:1,000
for teacher feedback systems.

43
0:02:11.864,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So I looked at the countries

44
0:02:13.654,000 --> 0:02:16,000
whose students perform well academically,

45
0:02:16.759,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and looked at what they're doing

46
0:02:19.064,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to help their teachers improve.

47
0:02:22.103,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.

48
0:02:25.336,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The U.S. isn't number one.

49
0:02:27.826,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're not even in the top 10.

50
0:02:29.881,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.

51
0:02:34.819,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, out of all the places

52
0:02:37.045,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that do better than the U.S. in reading,

53
0:02:39.635,000 --> 0:02:41,000
how many of them have a formal system

54
0:02:42.174,000 --> 0:02:44,000
for helping teachers improve?

55
0:02:45.165,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Eleven out of 14.

56
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,

57
0:02:50.565,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.

58
0:02:55.166,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So there's really only one area where we're near the top,

59
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:03:,000
and that's in failing to give our teachers

60
0:03:00.422,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the help they need to develop their skills.

61
0:03:04.043,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let's look at the best academic performer:

62
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the province of Shanghai, China.

63
0:03:10.765,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, they rank number one across the board,

64
0:03:14.098,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in reading, math and science,

65
0:03:17.017,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success

66
0:03:20.388,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is the way they help teachers keep improving.

67
0:03:24.022,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They made sure that younger teachers

68
0:03:26.351,000 --> 0:03:29,000
get a chance to watch master teachers at work.

69
0:03:30.018,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They have weekly study groups,

70
0:03:32.292,000 --> 0:03:34,000
where teachers get together and talk about what's working.

71
0:03:35.126,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They even require each teacher to observe

72
0:03:38.481,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and give feedback to their colleagues.

73
0:03:41.619,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You might ask, why is a system like this so important?

74
0:03:45.318,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's because there's so much variation

75
0:03:48.176,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the teaching profession.

76
0:03:50.257,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Some teachers are far more effective than others.

77
0:03:54.414,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In fact, there are teachers throughout the country

78
0:03:57.103,000 --> 0:04:,000
who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.

79
0:04:00.656,000 --> 0:04:02,000
If today's average teacher

80
0:04:02.899,000 --> 0:04:04,000
could become as good as those teachers,

81
0:04:05.495,000 --> 0:04:09,000
our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.

82
0:04:09.671,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So we need a system that helps all our teachers

83
0:04:12.578,000 --> 0:04:14,000
be as good as the best.

84
0:04:14.59,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What would that system look like?

85
0:04:17.187,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Well, to find out, our foundation

86
0:04:19.212,000 --> 0:04:21,000
has been working with 3,000 teachers

87
0:04:21.663,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in districts across the country

88
0:04:23.847,000 --> 0:04:27,000
on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.

89
0:04:28.066,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We had observers watch videos

90
0:04:30.417,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of teachers in the classroom

91
0:04:32.163,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and rate how they did on a range of practices.

92
0:04:35.751,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For example, did they ask their students

93
0:04:37.589,000 --> 0:04:39,000
challenging questions?

94
0:04:39.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?

95
0:04:43.997,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,

96
0:04:48.497,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Does your teacher know

97
0:04:50.21,000 --> 0:04:52,000
when the class understands a lesson?"

98
0:04:52.767,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"

99
0:04:55.923,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And what we found is very exciting.

100
0:04:58.752,000 --> 0:05:02,000
First, the teachers who did well on these observations

101
0:05:02.871,000 --> 0:05:04,000
had far better student outcomes.

102
0:05:05.322,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So it tells us we're asking the right questions.

103
0:05:08.58,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And second, teachers in the program told us

104
0:05:11.393,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that these videos and these surveys from the students

105
0:05:14.943,000 --> 0:05:16,000
were very helpful diagnostic tools,

106
0:05:17.626,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because they pointed to specific places

107
0:05:20.255,000 --> 0:05:22,000
where they can improve.

108
0:05:22.283,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I want to show you what this video component of MET

109
0:05:26.326,000 --> 0:05:28,000
looks like in action.

110
0:05:28.91,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Music)

111
0:05:31.857,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.

112
0:05:33.538,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Let's talk about what's going on today.

113
0:05:35.706,000 --> 0:05:38,000
To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?

114
0:05:39.055,000 --> 0:05:41,000
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class

115
0:05:41.51,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is for you to be able to determine

116
0:05:43.393,000 --> 0:05:45,000
whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.

117
0:05:46.347,000 --> 0:05:47,000
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.

118
0:05:47.816,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I am a high school English teacher

119
0:05:49.501,000 --> 0:05:51,000
at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.

120
0:05:51.564,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Turn to somebody next to you.

121
0:05:53.311,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about --

122
0:05:56.11,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I think that there is a difference for teachers

123
0:05:58.771,000 --> 0:06:01,000
between the abstract of how we see our practice

124
0:06:02.244,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then the concrete reality of it.

125
0:06:03.887,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.

126
0:06:07.437,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I think what video offers for us

127
0:06:10.08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is a certain degree of reality.

128
0:06:12.394,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You can't really dispute what you see on the video,

129
0:06:15.03,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and there is a lot to be learned from that,

130
0:06:17.989,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and there are a lot of ways that we can grow

131
0:06:19.918,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as a profession when we actually get to see this.

132
0:06:22.849,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod

133
0:06:25.842,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.

134
0:06:29.252,000 --> 0:06:31,000
At the beginning of class, I just perch it

135
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.

136
0:06:34.185,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.

137
0:06:36.923,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.

138
0:06:40.203,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And I'm able to learn a lot from it.

139
0:06:42.252,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So it really has been a simple

140
0:06:45.137,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but powerful tool in my own reflection.

141
0:06:47.983,000 --> 0:06:5,000
All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?

142
0:06:51.032,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,

143
0:06:53.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.

144
0:06:56.436,000 --> 0:06:58,000
If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.

145
0:06:58.548,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,

146
0:07:02.203,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.

147
0:07:06.29,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I really have used it for my own personal growth

148
0:07:08.319,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy

149
0:07:11.245,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and methodology and classroom management,

150
0:07:14.514,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and just all of those different facets of the classroom.

151
0:07:18.02,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before

152
0:07:20.694,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.

153
0:07:23.219,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I think that video exposes

154
0:07:26.544,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers

155
0:07:30.028,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in ways that help us learn and help us understand,

156
0:07:33.185,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and then help our broader communities understand

157
0:07:35.792,000 --> 0:07:38,000
what this complex work is really all about.

158
0:07:39.628,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate

159
0:07:43.76,000 --> 0:07:45,000
things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,

160
0:07:46.675,000 --> 0:07:48,000
things you cannot convey in a standard,

161
0:07:48.828,000 --> 0:07:5,000
things that you cannot even sometimes convey

162
0:07:51.057,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in a book of pedagogy.

163
0:07:53.867,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.

164
0:07:56.233,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I'll see you later.

165
0:07:57.469,000 --> 0:07:59,000
[Every classroom could look like that]

166
0:07:59.756,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

167
0:08:05.183,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America

168
0:08:08.155,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to look something like that.

169
0:08:10.839,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But we still have more work to do.

170
0:08:13.46,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve

171
0:08:16.18,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is only half the battle.

172
0:08:18.767,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We also have to give them the tools they need

173
0:08:21.152,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to act on the diagnosis.

174
0:08:23.65,000 --> 0:08:24,000
If you learn that you need to improve

175
0:08:25.565,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the way you teach fractions,

176
0:08:27.306,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you should be able to watch a video

177
0:08:29.814,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of the best person in the world teaching fractions.

178
0:08:33.526,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So building this complete teacher feedback

179
0:08:36.268,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and improvement system won't be easy.

180
0:08:39.378,000 --> 0:08:41,000
For example, I know some teachers

181
0:08:41.388,000 --> 0:08:43,000
aren't immediately comfortable with the idea

182
0:08:43.856,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of a camera in the classroom.

183
0:08:46.656,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That's understandable, but our experience with MET

184
0:08:49.972,000 --> 0:08:52,000
suggests that if teachers manage the process,

185
0:08:53.417,000 --> 0:08:55,000
if they collect video in their own classrooms,

186
0:08:55.902,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and they pick the lessons they want to submit,

187
0:08:58.878,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a lot of them will be eager to participate.

188
0:09:02.639,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Building this system will also require

189
0:09:05.592,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a considerable investment.

190
0:09:08.615,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Our foundation estimates that it could cost

191
0:09:11.972,000 --> 0:09:13,000
up to five billion dollars.

192
0:09:14.127,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,

193
0:09:18.481,000 --> 0:09:19,000
it's less than two percent

194
0:09:20.474,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.

195
0:09:24.769,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.

196
0:09:28.081,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We would finally have a way to give them feedback,

197
0:09:32.038,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as well as the means to act on it.

198
0:09:34.735,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But this system would have

199
0:09:35.92,000 --> 0:09:38,000
an even more important benefit for our country.

200
0:09:39.71,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It would put us on a path to making sure

201
0:09:42.883,000 --> 0:09:45,000
all our students get a great education,

202
0:09:46.082,000 --> 0:09:48,000
find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,

203
0:09:48.773,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and have a chance to live out their dreams.

204
0:09:52.012,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.

205
0:09:56.366,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.

206
0:10:01.87,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I'm excited about the opportunity

207
0:10:04.605,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.

208
0:10:09.354,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I hope you are too.

209
0:10:11.081,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Thank you.

210
0:10:12.852,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Applause)

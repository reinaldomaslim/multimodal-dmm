1
0:00:12.785,000 --> 0:00:13,000
What if I could present you a story

2
0:00:14.689,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that you would remember with your entire body

3
0:00:17.127,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and not just with your mind?

4
0:00:19.308,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled

5
0:00:22.007,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to try to make stories that can make a difference

6
0:00:24.342,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and maybe inspire people to care.

7
0:00:26.936,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary.

8
0:00:29.286,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I've worked in broadcast.

9
0:00:30.579,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality

10
0:00:33.665,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that I started seeing these really intense,

11
0:00:36.53,000 --> 0:00:37,000
authentic reactions from people

12
0:00:38.538,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that really blew my mind.

13
0:00:40.237,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So the deal is that with VR, virtual reality,

14
0:00:44.934,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I can put you on scene

15
0:00:47.958,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in the middle of the story.

16
0:00:50.148,000 --> 0:00:53,000
By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look,

17
0:00:53.656,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you get this whole-body sensation,

18
0:00:56.608,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like you're actually, like, there.

19
0:00:59.209,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope

20
0:01:02.635,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with using virtual reality and journalism together.

21
0:01:05.909,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.

22
0:01:08.481,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Families in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed,

23
0:01:11.664,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and they're often running out of food.

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry,

25
0:01:17.973,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical.

26
0:01:22.726,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So -- again, this is five years ago --

27
0:01:25.814,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so doing journalism and virtual reality together

28
0:01:29.014,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was considered a worse-than-half-baked idea,

29
0:01:32.021,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I had no funding.

30
0:01:33.4,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Believe me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me.

31
0:01:35.923,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I did, though, have a really great intern,

32
0:01:39.737,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.

33
0:01:41.999,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And together we went out to food banks

34
0:01:43.841,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and started recording audio and photographs.

35
0:01:46.937,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Until one day she came back to my office

36
0:01:48.881,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and she was bawling, she was just crying.

37
0:01:51.3,000 --> 0:01:53,000
She had been on scene at a long line,

38
0:01:53.926,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed,

39
0:01:57.895,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and she was screaming, "There's too many people!

40
0:02:00.887,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There's too many people!"

41
0:02:02.807,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time,

42
0:02:06.386,000 --> 0:02:09,000
his blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma.

43
0:02:10.695,000 --> 0:02:11,000
As soon as I heard that audio,

44
0:02:12.251,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece

45
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that could really describe what was going on at food banks.

46
0:02:19.29,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So here's the real line. You can see how long it was, right?

47
0:02:22.93,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding,

48
0:02:25.581,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated,

49
0:02:29.355,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models

50
0:02:33.505,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and make things as accurate as we could.

51
0:02:35.688,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And then we tried to convey what happened that day

52
0:02:38.321,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with as much as accuracy as is possible.

53
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Video) Voice: There's too many people! There's too many people!

54
0:02:54.34,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.

55
0:03:11.023,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Voice: We need an ambulance.

56
0:03:14.181,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Nonny de la Peña: So the man on the right,

57
0:03:16.222,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for him, he's walking around the body.

58
0:03:18.118,000 --> 0:03:2,000
For him, he's in the room with that body.

59
0:03:21.355,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Like, that guy is at his feet.

60
0:03:23.601,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And even though, through his peripheral vision,

61
0:03:25.832,000 --> 0:03:27,000
he can see that he's in this lab space,

62
0:03:27.927,000 --> 0:03:31,000
he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street,

63
0:03:32.164,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but he feels like he's there with those people.

64
0:03:35.084,000 --> 0:03:37,000
He's very cautious not to step on this guy

65
0:03:37.118,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who isn't really there, right?

66
0:03:39.506,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012,

67
0:03:42.633,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film

68
0:03:46.578,000 --> 0:03:47,000
ever, basically.

69
0:03:49.062,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And when we went, I was really terrified.

70
0:03:51.047,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I didn't really know how people were going to react

71
0:03:53.508,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and what was going to happen.

72
0:03:54.921,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles.

73
0:03:57.842,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying.

74
0:04:01.851,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So you can hear the surprise in my voice, right?

75
0:04:04.595,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw

76
0:04:08.214,000 --> 0:04:1,000
over and over and over:

77
0:04:11.008,000 --> 0:04:14,000
people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim,

78
0:04:14.738,000 --> 0:04:15,000
trying to whisper something into his ear

79
0:04:16.682,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or in some way help, even though they couldn't.

80
0:04:20.664,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying,

81
0:04:23.372,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"Oh my God, I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy,"

82
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and take that back into their lives.

83
0:04:28.999,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So after this piece was made,

84
0:04:32.198,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California,

85
0:04:36.031,000 --> 0:04:4,000
brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger,"

86
0:04:40.262,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and he took off the goggles,

87
0:04:41.627,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot.

88
0:04:44.691,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids,

89
0:04:47.628,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war.

90
0:04:52.809,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps,

91
0:04:56.791,000 --> 0:04:59,000
basically an area I wouldn't send a team now,

92
0:04:59.966,000 --> 0:05:01,000
as that's where ISIS is really operating.

93
0:05:02.458,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then we also recreated a street scene

94
0:05:05.188,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off.

95
0:05:09.34,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, when you're in the middle of that scene

96
0:05:11.443,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and you hear those sounds,

97
0:05:14.021,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and you see the injured around you,

98
0:05:16.338,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it's an incredibly scary and real feeling.

99
0:05:19.362,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me

100
0:05:23.926,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that it evokes the same kind of fear.

[A virtual reality experience]

107
0:05:58.653,000 --> 0:06:,000
NP: We were then invited to take the piece

108
0:06:00.745,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

109
0:06:02.823,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And it wasn't advertised.

110
0:06:04.204,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we were put in this tapestry room.

111
0:06:06.552,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There was no press about it,

112
0:06:07.918,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day

113
0:06:11.679,000 --> 0:06:12,000
would see us with these crazy lights.

114
0:06:13.466,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries.

115
0:06:17.165,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras.

116
0:06:20.513,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But a lot of people tried it, and over a five-day run

117
0:06:23.664,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we ended up with 54 pages of guest book comments,

118
0:06:28.228,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and we were told by the curators there

119
0:06:30.588,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that they'd never seen such an outpouring.

120
0:06:33.201,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Things like, "It's so real," "Absolutely believable,"

121
0:06:37.852,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or, of course, the one that I was excited about,

122
0:06:40.336,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something

123
0:06:43.209,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that you normally see on the TV news."

124
0:06:46.463,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, it works, right? This stuff works.

125
0:06:50.297,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are --

126
0:06:54.116,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it's really evocative.

127
0:06:56.343,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that when you're in a piece

128
0:07:00.319,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you forget that you're here.

129
0:07:03.223,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once.

130
0:07:06.422,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We can have what I call this duality of presence,

131
0:07:09.596,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy.

132
0:07:14.477,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Right?

133
0:07:16.041,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So that means, of course,

134
0:07:19.256,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces.

135
0:07:24.175,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I have to really follow best journalistic practices

136
0:07:28.461,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and make sure that these powerful stories

137
0:07:30.62,000 --> 0:07:31,000
are built with integrity.

138
0:07:32.23,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If we don't capture the material ourselves,

139
0:07:34.627,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we have to be extremely exacting

140
0:07:39.619,000 --> 0:07:42,000
about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from

141
0:07:42.944,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and is it authentic?

142
0:07:44.276,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Let me give you an example.

143
0:07:45.657,000 --> 0:07:47,000
With this Trayvon Martin case, this is a guy, a kid,

144
0:07:48.618,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who was 17 years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store,

145
0:07:52.745,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman

146
0:07:56.245,000 --> 0:07:58,000
named George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him.

147
0:07:59.657,000 --> 0:08:,000
To make that piece,

148
0:08:00.833,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex,

149
0:08:04.459,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out, based on those drawings.

150
0:08:09.252,000 --> 0:08:1,000
All of the action

151
0:08:10.571,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is informed by the real 911 recorded calls to the police.

152
0:08:16.411,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And interestingly, we broke some news with this story.

153
0:08:19.212,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction, Primeau Productions,

154
0:08:23.211,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they say that they would testify

155
0:08:25.181,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that George Zimmerman, when he got out of the car,

156
0:08:27.88,000 --> 0:08:29,000
he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin.

157
0:08:32.013,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism,

158
0:08:35.442,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they don't really change here, right?

159
0:08:37.339,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We're still following the same principles that we would always.

160
0:08:40.767,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What is different is the sense of being on scene,

161
0:08:44.094,000 --> 0:08:46,000
whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger

162
0:08:46.459,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene.

163
0:08:48.968,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces,

164
0:08:53.94,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and thinking about how to make them.

165
0:08:55.687,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We're trying to make this, obviously, beyond the headset, more available.

166
0:08:59.906,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece.

167
0:09:02.857,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And these things have had impact.

168
0:09:06.43,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I've had Americans tell me that they've donated,

169
0:09:09.026,000 --> 0:09:13,000
direct deductions from their bank account, money to go to Syrian children refugees.

170
0:09:13.444,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And "Hunger in LA," well, it's helped start

171
0:09:15.801,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a new form of doing journalism

172
0:09:18.254,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms

173
0:09:21.374,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in the future.

174
0:09:22.549,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Thank you.

175
0:09:23.737,000 --> 0:09:25,000

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
First place I'd like to take you

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that I'll talk a little bit about.

6
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
One of the things that's changed here,

7
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in the last 150 years since Jules Verne

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that you can see for hundreds of meters

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
without a break in the line of sight.

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for anywhere from two to four months,

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And a lot of people ask me, you know,

19
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what kind of people do you get for a project like this?

20
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
While our selection process

21
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.

22
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.

23
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.

24
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But we also value esprit de corps

26
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict

27
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
while under great stress in remote locations.

28
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.

29
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.

30
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.

32
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,

33
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
except that you're now running a string of these things down.

34
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort

35
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.

36
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,

37
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is artificially illuminated at great effort.

38
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.

39
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.

40
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.

41
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous

42
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.

43
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.

44
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.

45
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Video)

46
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here

47
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are obsolete and dangerous.

48
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.

49
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Along that same line, I have to tell you

51
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,

52
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we have never seen monsters underground --

53
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
at least the kind that eat you.

54
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If there is a monster underground,

55
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it is the crushing psychological remoteness

56
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that begins to hit every member of the team

57
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.

58
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.

59
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --

60
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that's a little over 8,600 feet down --

61
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
at 30 kilometers from the entrance.

62
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.

63
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.

64
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,

65
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.

66
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum

67
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that collects water and fills to the roof.

68
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And when you used to find these things,

69
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.

70
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.

71
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,

72
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is because the confrontation of these things

73
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
forced me to become an inventor.

74
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we've since gone on to develop

75
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.

76
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.

77
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally

78
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.

79
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.

80
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,

81
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.

82
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment

83
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for long range, away from a safe haven.

84
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie

85
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
that came out in 1999.

86
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process

87
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.

88
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.

89
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
To experience it is a privilege.

90
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.

91
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment

92
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.

93
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.

94
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,

95
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done

96
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.

97
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door

98
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to another unexplored world.

99
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is Europa.

100
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.

101
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is one of the places where planetary scientists

102
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
believe there is a highest probability of the detection

103
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.

104
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
For those who have never seen this story,

105
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie

106
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."

107
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There was a brief clip --

108
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa

109
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
would be the ultimate robotic challenge.

110
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,

111
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.

112
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards

113
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and to find a good landing site on the ice.

114
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now we have to get through the ice.

115
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
You need a melt probe.

116
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.

117
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.

118
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight

119
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
through the ancient ice, until finally --

120
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?

121
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.

122
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate

123
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.

124
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie

125
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:48,000
was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled

126
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.

127
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design

128
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --

129
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.

130
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.

131
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,

132
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,

133
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.

134
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is the target site,

135
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.

136
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters

137
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and beyond that nobody knows anything.

138
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.

139
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There are two primary targets we're doing here.

140
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?

141
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?

142
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There are more stages involved here

143
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive

144
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --

145
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
sulphide, halide, things like that.

146
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall

147
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where there's a high probability of life.

148
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,

149
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
looking for changes in color.

150
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.

151
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.

152
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We either draw in a liquid sample,

153
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.

154
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
No hands at the wheel.

155
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This is all behavioral autonomy here

156
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that's being conducted by the robot on its own.

157
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The real hat trick for this vehicle, though,

158
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,

159
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.

160
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.

161
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,

162
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
allowing it to do new exploration

163
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock

164
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:38,000
on what it's gone through already.

165
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What I'm going to show you next

166
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground

167
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that's ever been done.

168
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,

169
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first

170
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
robotically-discovered division of bacteria.

171
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,

172
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,

173
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019

174
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.

175
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
What then of manned space exploration?

176
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.

177
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The successful conclusion of that mission will result

178
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number

179
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of government scientists and pilots.

180
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion

181
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.

182
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Something fundamental has to change

183
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.

184
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.

185
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith

186
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.

187
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:46,000
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.

188
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
One of them is the requirement

189
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for economical earth-to-space transport.

190
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world

191
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
have got this in their sights and I salute them.

192
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Go, go, go.

193
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.

194
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.

195
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:

196
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
a gas station on orbit.

197
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's not going to look like that.

198
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:21,000
If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.

199
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Now, to give you a chance to understand

200
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
why there is power in that statement,

201
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.

202
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.

203
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Anybody drink one of these here this week?

204
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.

205
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
That's more than you pay for TED,

206
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
if Google dropped their sponsorship.

207
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Laughter)

208
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.

209
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,

210
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money

211
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
every time you hit the accelerator.

212
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.

213
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?

214
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
There is a place where you can.

215
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower

216
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
if you can find propellant on the moon.

217
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
There is a little-known mission that was launched

218
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.

219
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission

220
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater

221
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
on the south pole of the moon.

222
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That signal was so strong,

223
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water

224
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years

225
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
by the impact of asteroids and comet material.

226
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,

227
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.

228
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We can't do that right now.

229
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack

230
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that has to be launched from the ground,

231
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.

232
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We have to beat that.

233
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.

234
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.

235
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,

236
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.

237
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And we can extend that now to just about everything.

238
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.

239
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We can go much further.

240
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.

241
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:4,000
There's another thing.

242
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
When you're coming back from the moon,

243
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you have to deal with orbital mechanics.

244
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster

245
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.

246
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You got two choices.

247
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:55,000
You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.

248
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
You can dive into the stratosphere,

249
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.

250
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It has never been done.

251
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:06,000
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --

252
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
better than Disney.

253
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The traditional approach to space exploration

254
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
has been that you carry all the fuel you need

255
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to get everybody back in case of an emergency.

256
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
If you try to do that for the moon,

257
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.

258
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But if you send a mining team there,

259
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
without the return propellant, first --

260
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

261
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?

262
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.

263
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it

264
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
so we're not going to burn the gear.

265
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,

266
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and it would be the most dramatic demonstration

267
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that you could do something worthwhile off this planet

268
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that has ever been done.

269
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space

270
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.

271
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:58,000
That's not true.

272
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
In seven years, we could pull off

273
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:02,000
an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate

274
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.

275
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.

276
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth

277
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.

278
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
The orbital refueling stations I've just described

279
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key

280
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
for opening space to the general exploration.

281
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.

282
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial

283
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,

284
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate

285
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.

286
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities

287
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
of purpose and timing.

288
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.

289
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I intend to lead that expedition.

290
0:16:53,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Applause)

291
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
It can be done in seven years with the right backing.

292
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history

293
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and join other bold individuals from time past

294
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:14,000
who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.

295
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:2,000
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.

296
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We have collectively forgotten that lesson.

297
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.

298
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:35,000
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,

299
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon

300
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and complete the final piece

301
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.

302
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Thank you.

303
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.003,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I think stairs may be

3
0:00:14.769,000 --> 0:00:18,000
one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements

4
0:00:19.442,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that an architect has to work with.

[David Rockwell on the Stairs]

7
0:00:27.451,000 --> 0:00:3,000
At its most basic, a stair is a way to get from point A to point B

8
0:00:31.134,000 --> 0:00:32,000
at different elevations.

9
0:00:32.737,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Stairs have a common language.

10
0:00:35.293,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Treads, which is the thing that you walk on.

11
0:00:38.15,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Riser, which is the vertical element that separates the two treads.

12
0:00:42.087,000 --> 0:00:45,000
A lot of stairs have nosings that create a kind of edge.

13
0:00:45.991,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And then, the connected piece is a stringer.

14
0:00:49.761,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Those pieces, in different forms, make up all stairs.

15
0:00:53.783,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I assume stairs came to be from the first time someone said,

16
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock."

17
0:00:59.688,000 --> 0:01:01,000
People climbed using whatever was available:

18
0:01:01.934,000 --> 0:01:03,000
stepped logs, ladders

19
0:01:04.181,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and natural pathways that were worn over time.

20
0:01:06.87,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Some of the earliest staircases, like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá

21
0:01:10.537,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or the roads to Mount Tai in China,

22
0:01:12.846,000 --> 0:01:14,000
were a means of getting to a higher elevation,

23
0:01:15.384,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which people sought for worship or for protection.

24
0:01:18.846,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As engineering has evolved, so has what's practical.

25
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Stairs can be made from all kinds of material.

26
0:01:25.394,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There are linear stairs, there are spiraled stairs.

27
0:01:27.799,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Stairs can be indoors, they can be outdoors.

28
0:01:30.362,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They clearly help us in an emergency.

29
0:01:32.704,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But they're also a form of art in and of themselves.

30
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:42,000
As we move across a stairway,

31
0:01:42.909,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the form dictates our pacing, our feeling, our safety

32
0:01:47.273,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and our relationship and engagement with the space around us.

33
0:01:51.759,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So for a second, think about stepping down a gradual, monumental staircase

34
0:01:56.273,000 --> 0:01:58,000
like the one in front of the New York Public Library.

35
0:01:59.201,000 --> 0:02:,000
From those steps,

36
0:02:00.424,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you have a view of the street and all the people around you,

37
0:02:03.67,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and your walk is slow and steady because the tread is so wide.

38
0:02:07.726,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That's a totally different experience

39
0:02:10.004,000 --> 0:02:13,000
than going down the narrow staircase to, say, an old pub,

40
0:02:13.047,000 --> 0:02:14,000
where you spill into the room.

41
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There, you encounter tall risers, so you move more quickly.

42
0:02:18.196,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Stairs add enormous drama.

43
0:02:20.337,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Think about how stairs signaled a grand entrance

44
0:02:23.768,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and were the star of that moment.

45
0:02:25.647,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Stairs can even be heroic.

46
0:02:27.311,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The staircase that remained standing after September 11th

47
0:02:30.623,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the attack on the World Trade Center

48
0:02:32.663,000 --> 0:02:33,000
was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase,"

49
0:02:34.559,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because it played such a central role in leading hundreds of people to safety.

50
0:02:39.44,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But small stairs can have a huge impact, too.

51
0:02:41.984,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The stoop is a place that invites neighbors to gather,

52
0:02:44.987,000 --> 0:02:46,000
blast music, and watch the city in motion.

53
0:02:48.049,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's fascinating to me that you see people wanting to hang out on the stairs.

54
0:02:51.742,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I think they fill a deeply human need we have

55
0:02:56.401,000 --> 0:03:,000
to inhabit a space more than just on the ground plane.

56
0:03:00.627,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And so if you're able to sit halfway up there,

57
0:03:05.086,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you're in a kind of magical place.

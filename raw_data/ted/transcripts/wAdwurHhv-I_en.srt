1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well most of my work that I work with

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is really a little bit about methodologies of working

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
rather than actually a specific discipline

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or a specific technique.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So let me show you a little of that.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So it started over here.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And as I was coming back,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and went into a little room

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and he asked me all sorts of questions --

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" --

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
all these little details.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And then literally just out of nowhere,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or any date for that fact,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I pulled out my little PDA,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Where were you October 5th?"

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We read about six months of my calendar.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of what I did.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But good thing I did,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because I don't look good in orange.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So he asked me --

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Applause)

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what did you have in it?"

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This was in Tampa, Florida,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Just assorted garage sale junk,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because I'm a pack rat."

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And he's still a little confused,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And so we're sitting there,

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was like, "Great."

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So I got home and the phone rings,

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a man introduced himself.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where I spent six months of my life --

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
back and forth, not six months continuously.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
By the way, you folks know that in the United States,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you can't take photographs of federal buildings,

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but Google can do it for you.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So to the folks from Google, thank you.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So I spent a lot of time in this building.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Questions like:

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when you're doing this.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You're basically face-to-face with someone

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that essentially decides life or death.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them --

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
one of the polygraph questions was ...

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Then, of course, the next question is:

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I work at a university.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was like, "No."

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So at the end of six months of this

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and nine consecutive polygraphs,

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they said, "Hey, everything's fine."

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I know everything's fine."

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So they're looking at me really odd.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is with the FBI.

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and here we go all over again."

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And there was a sincere concern there.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
give us a call -- we'll take care of it."

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
on March 12th" or whatever.

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Just letting you know. Heads up."

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then the phone calls turned into emails,

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with pictures,

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
with travel tips.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Then I'd make websites.

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So I actually designed this back in 2003.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I'll help you out.

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Well they probably have all my flight records,

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So you can see, Delta 1252

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
going from Kansas City to Atlanta.

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This was on Delta 719

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
going from JFK to San Francisco.

142
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that,

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but they'll give it to me on the plane.

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
These are the airports that I hang out in,

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because I like airports.

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is in Warsaw.

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
These images are shot really anonymously

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to the point where it could be anyone.

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and putting it all together.

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And when you're in a situation

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
where you have to justify every moment of your existence,

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
At the time that this was going on,

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the last thing on my mind was "art project."

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And after piecing together this, this and this,

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
eventually evolved into this,

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it actually became this project.

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them --

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because they need to know.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This is me buying some duck flavored paste

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
at the Ranch 99 in Daly City

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
on Sunday, November 15th.

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
At Coreana Supermarket

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I bought some crabs too right around there,

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland --

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
East Oakland, sorry.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then my pickled jellyfish

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now if you go to my bank records,

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it'll actually show something from there,

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so you know that, on May 9th,

182
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there,

184
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but now there's a third party,

185
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
an independent third party, my bank,

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.

187
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And there's a verification taking place.

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Sometimes they're really small purchases.

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.

191
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and everything pops up right away.

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Sometimes there's a lot of information.

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.

195
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then sometimes you get this.

196
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,

197
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
January 22nd.

198
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because this is what I had to do with the FBI.

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I spend a lot of time on the road.

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
off of Route 80

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.

206
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So there's multiple databases.

207
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.

208
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,

209
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and the FBI has seen all of them --

210
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
at least I trust they've seen all of them.

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all,

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you just get this empty bed.

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So you get something like this.

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California --

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Vietnamese sandwich.

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So there's different categorizations

218
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of meals eaten outside

219
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
empty train stations, empty gas stations.

220
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?

222
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So again, you have to do some detective work here.

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So sometimes the databases get so specific.

225
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City

226
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
near a train station

227
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
on July fifth to July sixth.

228
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.

229
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.

230
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Every few moments I shoot the image.

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now it's all done on my iPhone,

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and it all goes straight up to my server,

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and my server does all the backend work

235
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and categorizes things and puts everything together.

236
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They need to know where I'm doing my business,

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because they want to know about my business.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So on December 4th, I went here.

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 --

240
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So what you're basically seeing here

243
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is all bits and pieces and all this information.

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.

247
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is that everything is there,

249
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but you have to really work through it.

250
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So by me putting all this information out there,

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.

252
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But in this barrage of noise

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that I'm putting out,

254
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And you know very little about me actually.

256
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And really so I've come to the conclusion

257
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that the way you protect your privacy,

258
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
particularly in an era where everything is cataloged

259
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and everything is archived and everything is recorded,

260
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there's no need to delete information anymore.

261
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So what do you do when everything is out there?

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Well you have to take control over it.

263
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And if I give you this information directly,

264
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it's a very different type of identity

265
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.

266
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here

267
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is the fact that intelligence agencies --

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and it doesn't matter who they are --

269
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
they all operate in an industry

270
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where their commodity is information,

271
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
or restricted access to information.

272
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And the reason their information has any value

273
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is, well, because no one else has access to it.

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And by me cutting out the middle man

275
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and giving it straight to you,

276
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the information that the FBI has has no value,

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
so thus devaluing their currency.

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And I understand that, on an individual level,

279
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it's purely symbolic.

280
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But if 300 million people in the U.S.

281
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
started doing this,

282
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
from the ground up.

284
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And we're getting to that.

286
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
When I first started this project,

287
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
people were looking at me and saying,

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?

289
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Why are you posting these photos?"

290
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere

291
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and 750 million people

292
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
were posting status messages

293
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
or poking people.

294
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because you're all doing it.

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,

298
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
whether we're aware of it or not.

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So we're creating our own archives and so on.

300
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And you know, some of my friends have always said,

301
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?

302
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Because no one's really watching.

303
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
No one's really going to bother you."

304
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So one of the things that I do

305
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.

306
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Because it's about surveillance.

307
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I'm watching who's watching me.

308
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I came up with these.

309
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So these are some of my sample logs.

310
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.

312
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by --

313
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Department of Homeland Security.

314
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.

315
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.

316
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Central Intelligence Agency.

317
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Executive Office of the President.

318
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.

319
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I think they kind of like to look at art.

320
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.

321
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So thank you very much. I appreciate it.

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

323
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.

324
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"

325
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.

326
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So how many hours of the day does that take?

327
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
HE: Almost none.

328
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It's no different

329
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
than sending a text.

330
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's no different than checking an email.

331
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.

332
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So it's just become another day.

333
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I mean, when we update a status message,

334
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we don't really think about how long that's going to take.

335
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,

336
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
send, and then it's done.

337
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And everything's automated at the other end.

338
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?

339
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.

340
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So it holds onto the very last point.

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight,

342
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
you'll see the last airport that I departed from.

343
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.)

344
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

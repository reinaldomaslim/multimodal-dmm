1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We're entering a second generation of no progress

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to go out and continue this very important thing

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that we as a species have always done.

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And that is, instinctively we've gone out

8
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,

9
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.

10
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I feel very strongly

11
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids

12
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version

13
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of a cell phone with a video in it.

14
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.

16
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us

17
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and help us survive in the future.

18
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine

19
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.

20
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.

21
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What we're looking forward to is --

23
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what we're looking forward to

25
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is not only the inspiration of our children,

26
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing

27
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's

28
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:16,000
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.

29
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?

30
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.

31
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --

32
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,

33
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is that right back to where we inspire people

34
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
who will be our great leaders later.

35
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.

36
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:

37
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.

38
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What they look at is the most important thing.

39
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.

40
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period

41
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when marvelous things happened.

42
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,

43
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown

44
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,

45
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.

46
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,

47
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.

48
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,

49
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.

50
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The ones that flew and landed OK

51
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because there were no trained pilots

52
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who had good flying qualities by definition.

53
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,

54
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts

55
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,

56
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.

57
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That has not happened at all in space flying.

58
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.

59
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, who was inspired during that time period?

60
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought

61
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.

62
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them

63
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:29,000
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.

64
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.

65
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there

66
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.

67
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting

68
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;

69
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?

70
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots

71
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and they've landed it only in the deserts.

72
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

73
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,

74
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters

75
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the blue line is commercial air transport.

76
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --

77
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage

78
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.

79
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?

80
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing

81
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.

82
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War

83
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.

84
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes

85
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that people could build in their garages.

86
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them

87
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,

88
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which is my company now.

89
0:05:53,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.

90
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.

91
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed

92
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.

93
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.

94
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?

95
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,

96
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,

97
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --

98
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that's kind of cool.

99
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.

100
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

101
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

102
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,

103
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.

104
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
These things tend to happen every 25 years.

105
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement

106
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --

107
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel

108
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.

109
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.

110
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles

111
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
if the government develops and the government uses it.

112
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.

113
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

114
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,

115
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.

116
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --

117
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

118
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,

119
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned

120
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
space flights in the world -- the very first year.

121
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.

122
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There were only three or four flights in 2003.

123
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights

124
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave

125
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
with my little group of a couple dozen people

126
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in order to get to a total of five,

127
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
which was the number the same year back in 1961.

128
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.

129
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.

130
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is a picture here taken from orbit.

131
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.

132
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --

133
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.

134
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage

135
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to go out and try that as a small company.

136
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?

137
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.

138
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There's another one announced just last week.

139
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital

140
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is, there is not solutions for adequate safety

141
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --

142
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
three governments have been doing this for 45 years,

143
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.

144
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.

145
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.

146
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I can't tell you when this will start,

147
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.

148
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,

149
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.

150
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon

151
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

152
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --

153
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.

154
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.

155
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

156
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending

157
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:26,000
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.

158
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."

159
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,

160
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:39,000
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978

161
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.

162
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:5,000
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.

163
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

164
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,

165
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but the home computer was for games.

166
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:01,000
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.

167
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,

168
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
big development, big improvement and capability and so on,

169
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.

170
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And the inventor is in this audience.

171
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,

172
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --

173
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:29,000
a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,

174
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:33,000
our communication and, if we let the Google guys

175
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)

176
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids

177
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.

178
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So fun is defendable.

179
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:53,000
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,

180
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.

181
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
And in it also brings up another point, right here.

182
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There's a group of people that have come forward --

183
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward

184
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:14,000
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,

185
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,

186
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
right in this time period.

187
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,

188
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:34,000
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,

189
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.

190
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:44,000
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,

191
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area

192
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:51,000
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --

193
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,

194
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and it will lead us into the next really big thing

195
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually

196
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.

197
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.

198
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
There were a couple of examples here.

199
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane

200
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,

201
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.

202
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It went a whole life cycle without competition,

203
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
took out of service. And we're stuck back here

204
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
with the same kind of capability for military fighters

205
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.

206
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.

207
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,

208
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or if you've got a 10-year-old now.

209
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.

210
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket

211
0:13:55,000 --> 0:14:,000
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance

212
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:04,000
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.

213
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance

214
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;

215
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:13,000
why do you need something better?

216
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying

217
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,

218
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters

219
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

220
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.

221
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:37,000
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.

222
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,

223
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
because we lost the first two milestones.

224
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware

225
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --

226
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
you can argue that's not a technical loss.

227
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.

228
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:06,000
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,

229
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and that was a very strong thing.

230
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,

231
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.

232
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.

233
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost

234
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.

235
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --

236
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:43,000
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.

237
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available

238
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
because a Russian space program is starving,

239
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.

240
0:15:54,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip

241
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.

242
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.

243
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,

244
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
when the space race was going on,

245
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do

246
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?

247
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,

248
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,

249
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese

250
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:38,000
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.

251
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.

252
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,

253
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:54,000
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.

254
0:16:54,000 --> 0:17:,000
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.

255
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.

256
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel

257
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:11,000
when the commercial stuff is offered.

258
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.

259
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
This little thing says here: five times

260
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:25,000
what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already

261
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion

262
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:35,000
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --

263
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:4,000
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,

264
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that

265
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:47,000
being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed

266
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.

267
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --

268
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars

269
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:03,000
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,

270
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:07,000
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.

271
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this

272
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:14,000
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer

273
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:18,000
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.

274
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:23,000
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently

275
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:31,000
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,

276
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:38,000
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,

277
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:44,000
will be at a level of about five times as much

278
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:49,000
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.

279
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.

280
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:03,000
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --

281
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,

282
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:1,000
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.

283
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:14,000
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,

284
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it

285
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:27,000
because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,

286
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:32,000
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,

287
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

288
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:37,000
OK, thank you very much.

289
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The best minds in the best institutions

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
generally get it wrong.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it's clearly in the area of finance.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
With institutions established to think about the future,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Over 20,000 economists

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
couldn't see what was happening.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Globalization is getting more complex.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And this change is getting more rapid.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The future will be more unpredictable.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Urbanization, integration,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
coming together, leads to a new renaissance.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It did this a thousand years ago.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for innovation, for development.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But there is an underbelly.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
those that are left out, those that feel angry,

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
those that are not participating. Globalization

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
has not been inclusive.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The second Achilles' heel is complexity --

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in what you can get for the same price

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in computing by 2030.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It will continue.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Our computers, our systems will be as primitive

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
as the Apollo's are for today.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Our mobile phones are more powerful than

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So what will this do?

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It will create huge opportunities in technology.

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Miniaturization as well.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in our brains, and in the air.

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
not least in the area of medicine.

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from an embryonic stem cell.

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We can develop any part of the body.

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
able to replicate parts of the body.

62
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,

64
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But the question is, "Who will have it?"

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The other major development is going to be

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the area of what can happen in genetics.

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
something which goes three times faster,

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
lasts for three times longer, we could produce,

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
using about the same amount of food.

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But will this only be available for the super rich,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?

75
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Will only those that are able to afford it

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
be able to be this super race of the future?

77
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So the big question for us is,

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"How do we manage this technological change?"

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
How do we ensure that it creates

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a more inclusive technology,

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a technology which means

83
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that not only as we grow older,

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the populations of the future?

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
will be moving from population pyramids

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to what we might term population coffins.

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
There is unlikely to be a pension

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or a retirement age in 2030.

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
type of new pyramids

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that will take place in China and in many other countries.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So forget about retirements if you're young.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Of course, migration will become even more important.

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The war on talent, the need to attract people

99
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
at all skill ranges,

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to push us around in our wheelchairs,

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The employment in the rich countries

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
will go down from about 800

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to about 700 million of these people.

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This would imply a massive leap in migration.

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,

107
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of migration, will be turned on their head,

108
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
as we search for people to help us sort out

109
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
our pensions and our economies in the future.

110
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then, the systemic risks.

111
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
We understand that these will become much more virulent,

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that what we see today

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is this interweaving of societies, of systems,

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.

115
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.

116
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The collapse in biodiversity,

117
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
climate change, pandemics, financial crises:

118
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
these will be the currency that we will think about.

119
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And so a new awareness will have to arise,

120
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,

121
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in a new way, and come together as a community

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to manage systemic risk.

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's going to require innovation.

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization

125
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
could also be its downfall.

126
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,

127
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or it could be our worst.

128
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And of course we need to worry about the individuals,

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
particularly the individuals that feel that they've

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
been left out in one way or another.

131
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
will have the capacity, by 2030,

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?

136
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
How do we think about complex systems in new ways?

137
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That will be the challenge of the scholars,

138
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.

139
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.

140
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.

141
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.

142
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
collectively, through collective wisdom.

144
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We know, and I know from my own experience,

145
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that amazing things can happen,

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
when individuals and societies come together

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to change their future.

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I left South Africa, and 15 years later,

149
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
after thinking I would never go back,

150
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.

151
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This was a miracle. We can create miracles,

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
collectively, in our lifetime.

153
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It is vital that we do so.

154
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,

155
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that the ideas that we think about

156
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,

157
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

158
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a bit funny to be

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
at a conference dedicated to things not seen,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and present my proposal to build

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a 6,000-kilometer-long wall

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
across the entire African continent.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
About the size of the Great Wall of China,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
this would hardly be an invisible structure.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
bacteria and grains of sand.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I only believe in opportunities.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Which is why I'll show you a threat,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and an architectural response.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The threat is desertification.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My response is a sandstone wall

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
made from bacteria and solidified sand,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
stretching across the desert.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, sand is a magical material

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of beautiful contradictions.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It is simple and complex.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It is peaceful and violent.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It is always the same, never the same,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
endlessly fascinating.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
One billion grains of sand

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
come into existence in the world each second.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That's a cyclical process.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As rocks and mountains die,

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
grains of sand are born.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Some of those grains may then accumulate

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
on a massive scale,

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
into a sand dune.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In a way, the static, stone mountain

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
becomes a moving mountain of sand.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.

39
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Some are already deserts;

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
others are being seriously degraded by the sand.

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The name means "edge of the desert."

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that major droughts brought three million people

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to become dependent upon emergency food aid,

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with about up to 250,000 dying.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And it's one that gets very little attention.

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In our accelerated media culture,

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
desertification is simply too slow

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to reach the headlines.

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
too few crying children and smashed up houses.

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And yet desertification

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is a major threat on all continents,

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
affecting some 110 countries

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
It seriously threatens the livelihoods

60
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of millions of people,

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and especially in Africa and China.

62
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves

63
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
through unsustainable use of scarce resources.

64
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So, we get climate change.

65
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We get droughts,

66
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
increased desertification,

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
crashing food systems, water scarcity,

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
famine, forced migration,

69
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
political instability, warfare, crisis.

70
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
That's a potential scenario

71
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
if we fail to take this seriously.

72
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But, how far away is it?

73
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria

74
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to try and find out how far away it is.

75
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,

77
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
physically pushing people away from their homes.

78
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --

79
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
with the elders in Gidan-Kara,

81
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a tiny village outside of Sokoto.

82
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They had to move this village in 1987

83
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.

84
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.

85
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is where the village used to be.

86
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,

87
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.

88
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That's the kind of forced migration

89
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that desertification can lead to.

90
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you happen to live close to the desert border,

91
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be

92
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
before you have to carry your kids away,

93
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and abandon your home and your life as you know it.

94
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.

95
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And still, those extreme environments are very good places

96
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
if we want to stop the shifting sands.

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Four years ago, 23 African countries

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.

99
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
A fantastic project, the initial plan

100
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted

101
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
right across the African continent,

102
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.

103
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,

104
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains

105
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
from avalanching over its crest.

106
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,

107
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is to use some kind of sand catcher.

108
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Trees or cacti are good for this.

109
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that

110
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the people in these regions are so poor

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that they chop them down for firewood.

112
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees

113
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and hoping that they won't get chopped down.

114
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.

115
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It adds roughness to the dune's surface,

116
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.

117
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It provides a physical support structure for the trees,

118
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and it creates physical spaces,

119
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.

120
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
If people live inside of the green barrier

121
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,

122
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and from some of the forces of nature.

123
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Inside of the dunes we find shade.

124
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We can start harvesting condensation,

125
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and start greening the desert from within.

126
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.

127
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,

128
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and then excavate the sand,

129
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and we have our architecture.

130
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We can either excavate it by hand

131
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or we can have the wind excavate it for us.

132
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site

133
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.

134
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But, by now, you're probably asking,

135
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?

136
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
How do we glue those grains of sand together?

137
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,

138
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Bacillus pasteurii,

139
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands

140
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and marshes, and does precisely that.

141
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It takes a pile of loose sand

142
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it creates sandstone out of it.

143
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.

144
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,

145
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.

146
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
A chemical process produces calcite,

147
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which is a kind of natural cement

148
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that binds the grains together.

149
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.

150
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.

151
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.

152
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,

153
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
working with the bugs at UCL in London,

154
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
trying to solidify them.

155
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, how much would this cost?

156
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'm not an economist, very much not,

157
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --

158
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete

160
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.

161
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,

162
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which you'll never have to pay again,

163
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
one cubic meter of bacterial sand

164
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
would be about 11 dollars.

165
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
How do we construct something like this?

166
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Well, I'll quickly show you two options.

167
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,

168
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,

169
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.

170
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Then, a few years afterwards,

171
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
using permacultural strategies,

172
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we green that part of the desert.

173
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The second alternative would be to use injection piles.

174
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,

175
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and we create an initial bacterial surface.

176
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We then pull the piles up through the dune

177
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand

178
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.

179
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,

180
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.

181
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But, what should they look like?

182
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,

183
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.

184
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.

185
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me

186
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
with good spatial qualities,

187
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.

188
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now, part of the formal control over this structure

189
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
would be lost to nature, obviously,

190
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
as the bacteria do their work.

191
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.

192
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I think there is really something in that articulation

193
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that is quite nice.

194
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We see the result, the traces, if you like,

195
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert

196
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
into these habitable environments.

197
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Some people believe that

198
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
this would spread uncontrollably,

199
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.

200
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That's not true at all.

201
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,

202
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.

203
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So, there it is --

204
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
architectural anti-desertification structures

205
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
made from the desert itself.

206
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.

207
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land

208
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by the end of the century.

209
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In a period of unprecedented population growth

210
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.

211
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.

212
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.

213
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But, if I had something like a TED wish,

214
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it would be to actually get it built,

215
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to start building this habitable wall,

216
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,

217
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
built into the dunescape itself.

218
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's not only something that supports trees,

219
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but something that connects people and countries together.

220
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,

221
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.

222
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Borges said that "nothing is built on stone,

223
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
everything is built on sand,

224
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but we must build as if the sand were stone."

225
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --

226
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
political, practical, ethical, financial.

227
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,

228
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is fraught with many challenges

229
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and difficulties in the real world.

230
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision.

231
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
As Borges would have it, it's the sand.

232
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And I think now is really the time

233
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to turn it into stone. Thank you.

234
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

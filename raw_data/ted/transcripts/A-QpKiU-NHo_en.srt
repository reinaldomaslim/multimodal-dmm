1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm here to talk to you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about the economic invisibility of nature.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The bad news

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so those invoices don't get issued.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But we need to do something about this problem.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I began my life as a markets professional

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and continued to take an interest,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but most of my recent effort

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
has been looking at the value

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of what comes to human beings from nature,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and which doesn't get priced by the markets.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
A project called TEEB was started in 2007,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it was launched by a group of environment ministers

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of the G8+5.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And their basic inspiration

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was a stern review of Lord Stern.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They asked themselves a question:

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If economics could make such a convincing case

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for early action on climate change,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
well why can't the same be done for conservation?

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Why can't an equivalent case be made

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for nature?

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And the answer is: Yeah, it can.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it's not that straightforward.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It exists in many layers,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
international, national, local, community --

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and doing for nature

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And yet, we began.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We began the project with an interim report,

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which quickly pulled together

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a lot of information that had been collected on the subject

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
by many, many researchers.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And amongst our compiled results

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was the startling revelation

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that, in fact, we were losing natural capital --

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the benefits that flow from nature to us.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of natural capital.

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This came out in 2008,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we had lost financial capital

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of the order of two and a half trillion dollars.

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We then have gone on since

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to present for [the] international community,

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for governments,

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for local governments and for business

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and for people, for you and me,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which address the economic invisibility of nature

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and describe what can be done to solve it.

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What is this about?

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
A picture that you're familiar with --

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the Amazon rainforests.

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but what people don't really know

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is this also is a rain factory.

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Because the northeastern trade winds,

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as they go over the Amazonas,

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
effectively gather the water vapor.

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and eventually precipitates in the form of rain

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
across the La Plata Basin.

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
effectively feeds an agricultural economy

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in Latin America.

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But the question arises: Okay, so how much

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
pay for that vital input to that economy

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the answer is zilch,

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
exactly zero.

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That's the economic invisibility of nature.

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That can't keep going on,

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Economics has become the currency of policy.

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And unless we address

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
this invisibility,

87
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we are going to get the results that we are seeing,

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is a gradual degradation and loss

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of this valuable natural asset.

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
No matter what level you look at,

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we see the same problem again and again.

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at an ecosystem level.

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
At the species level,

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
bees pollinating fruit and so on,

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's something like eight percent

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of the total agricultural output globally.

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It completely passes below the radar screen.

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
60 percent of medicines were prospected,

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Once again, most of that doesn't get paid.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that brings me to another aspect of this,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which is, to whom should this get paid?

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That genetic material

111
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to a local community of poor people

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which then became the medicine.

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They were the ones that didn't get paid.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And if you look at the species level,

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you saw about fish.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the artisanal fisher folk

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and those who fish for their own livelihoods,

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to feed their families.

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Something like a billion people depend on fish,

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the quantity of fish in the oceans.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
A billion people depend on fish

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
for their main source for animal protein.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And at this rate at which we are losing fish,

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
a health problem

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of a kind we haven't seen before.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And finally, at the ecosystem level,

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or whether it is the ability of poor farmers

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to go out and gather leaf litter

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for their cattle and goats,

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or whether it's the ability of their wives

137
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to go and collect fuel wood from the forest,

138
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it is actually the poor

139
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
who depend most on these ecosystem services.

140
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We did estimates in our study

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,

142
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
even though ecosystem services --

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the answers are more like

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.

149
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's the difference.

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Because these are important benefits for the poor.

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And you can't really have a proper model for development

152
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if at the same time you're destroying or allowing

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is your development asset,

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that is ecological infrastructure.

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
How bad can things get?

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's basically a measure

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of biomass of various species are around.

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The green represents the percentage.

162
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.

163
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.

164
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the pre-industrial era, 1750.

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now I'm going to show you

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
how business as usual will affect this.

168
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And just watch the change in colors

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in India, China, Europe,

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
sub-Saharan Africa

171
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
as we move on and consume global biomass

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
See that again.

174
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --

175
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,

176
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
like the tundra and like the Sahara.

177
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But that doesn't help because there were very few species

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and volume of biomass there in the first place.

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is the challenge.

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The reason this is happening

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,

182
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is our inability to perceive the difference

183
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
between public benefits

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and private profits.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
simply because it is in the common wealth,

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it's common goods.

188
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And here's an example from Thailand

189
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --

191
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
compared to its value as a shrimp farm,

192
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which is more like $9,600,

193
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves

194
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and convert them to shrimp farms.

195
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
almost 8,000 of those dollars

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are, in fact, subsidies.

198
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So you compare the two sides of the coin

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's not that hard.

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But on the other hand, if you start measuring,

202
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
how much would it actually cost

203
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to restore the land of the shrimp farm

204
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
back to productive use?

205
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition

206
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
has had its effects,

207
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.

208
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove

209
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,

211
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that provide fish for the poor,

212
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that answer is more like $11,000.

213
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So now look at the different lens.

214
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
If you look at the lens of public wealth

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
as against the lens of private profits,

216
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you get a completely different answer,

217
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which is clearly conservation makes more sense,

218
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and not destruction.

219
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So is this just a story from South Thailand?

220
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Sorry, this is a global story.

221
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And here's what the same calculation looks like,

222
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --

223
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
by a group called TRUCOST.

224
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
what are the externalities?

226
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?

227
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.

229
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,

230
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
health cost and so on.

231
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Use of freshwater.

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,

233
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.

234
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Can we stop this, and how?

235
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.

236
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,

237
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.

238
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
When we measure GDP

239
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as a measure of economic performance at the national level,

240
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.

241
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
When we measure corporate performances,

242
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we don't include our impacts on nature

243
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and what our business costs society.

244
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That has to stop.

245
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.

246
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.

247
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That was in the early 2000s

248
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth

249
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
as the means forward --

250
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent

251
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and wondering, why can we do the same?

252
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And a few friends of mine and I

253
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
decided this doesn't make sense.

254
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.

255
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations

256
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and started producing green accounts for India and its states.

257
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That's how my interests began

258
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and went to the TEEB project.

259
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.

260
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And the World Bank has acknowledged this

261
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and they've started a project called WAVES --

262
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.

263
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But calculating this at the next level,

264
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that means at the business sector level, is important.

265
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.

266
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We've done this for a very difficult case,

267
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
which was for deforestation in China.

268
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is important, because in China in 1997,

269
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months

270
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
causing severe loss of agriculture output

271
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and pain and loss to society.

272
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,

273
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
causing something like 5,500 deaths.

274
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.

275
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It was associated largely with the construction industry.

276
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And the Chinese government responded sensibly

277
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and placed a ban on felling.

278
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
A retrospective on 40 years

279
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
shows that if we had accounted for these costs --

280
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the cost of loss of topsoil,

281
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the cost of loss of waterways,

282
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the lost productivity, the loss to local communities

283
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as a result of all these factors,

284
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
desertification and so on --

285
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
those costs are almost twice as much

286
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
as the market price of timber.

287
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace

288
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
ought to have been three-times what it was

289
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
had it reflected the true pain and the costs

290
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to the society within China.

291
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Of course, after the event one can be wise.

292
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,

293
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to take leadership forward,

294
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,

295
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and to disclose these answers.

296
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,

297
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
is it Unilever or is it P&G

298
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,

300
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
good though they are and professional though they are,

301
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
do not calculate or disclose their externalities.

302
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But if we look at companies like PUMA --

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
once challenged me at a function,

305
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.

306
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.

307
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.

308
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,

309
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
300 million dollars of profits,

310
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
200 million dollars after tax,

311
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.

312
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now that's not a happy situation for them,

313
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
but they have the confidence and the courage

314
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.

315
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We are measuring it because we know

316
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that you cannot manage what you do not measure."

317
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That's an example, I think, for us to look at

318
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and for us to draw comfort from.

319
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
If more companies did this,

320
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,

321
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
you could have analysts, business analysts,

322
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs

323
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
actually look and compare the social performance of companies.

324
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.

325
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
This can be done.

326
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.

327
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
has already set up a coalition to do this,

328
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
an international coalition.

329
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The other favorite, if you like, solution for me

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is the creation of green carbon markets.

331
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And by the way, these are my favorites --

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
externalities calculation and green carbon markets.

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions

334
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
including protected area evaluation

335
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and payments for ecosystem services

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.

337
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
What's green carbon?

338
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.

339
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's about energy emissions.

340
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.

341
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.

342
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,

343
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
you get what you see, declining prices.

344
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But that's all about energy and industry.

345
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But what we're missing is also some other emissions

346
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
like black carbon, that is soot.

347
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
What we're also missing is blue carbon,

348
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --

349
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
more than 55 percent.

350
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions

351
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,

352
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
is more or less balanced.

353
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
In fact, what's being absorbed

354
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
is something like 25 percent of our emissions,

355
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which then leads to acidification

356
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or lower alkalinity in oceans.

357
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
More of that in a minute.

358
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And finally, there's deforestation,

359
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and there's emission of methane

360
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
from agriculture.

361
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Green carbon,

362
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,

363
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and blue carbon

364
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
together comprise 25 percent of our emissions.

365
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We have the means already in our hands,

366
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --

367
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
a scheme for the reduced emissions

368
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
from deforestation and forest degradation.

369
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each

370
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
towards Indonesia and Brazil

371
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to implement this Red Plus scheme.

372
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So we actually have some movement forward.

373
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But the thing is to do a lot more of that.

374
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?

375
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Well I'm afraid not.

376
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.

377
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
As you can see,

378
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
they cut across the entire globe

379
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
all the way from Micronesia

380
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar

381
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and to the West of the Caribbean.

382
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
These red dots, these red areas,

383
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
basically provide the food and livelihood

384
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
for more than half a billion people.

385
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So that's almost an eighth of society.

386
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --

387
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and scientists tell us

388
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million

389
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --

390
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
we are not only risking the extinction

391
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
of the entire coral species, the warm water corals,

392
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,

393
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods

394
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of more than 500 million people

395
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
who live in the developing world in poor countries.

396
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million

397
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,

398
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.

399
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society

400
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to not have coral reefs.

401
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Well what I will say to you in parting

402
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is that we may have done that.

403
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Let's think about it and what it means,

404
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but please, let's not do more of that.

405
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Because mother nature only has that much

406
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.

407
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.

408
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Thank you.

409
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
(Applause)

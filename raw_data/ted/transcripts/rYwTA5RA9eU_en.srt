1
0:00:12.207,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'd like to reimagine education.

2
0:00:15.558,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The last year

3
0:00:17.148,000 --> 0:00:19,000
has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.

4
0:00:20.054,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It starts with an M.

5
0:00:21.967,000 --> 0:00:25,000
MOOC: massive open online courses.

6
0:00:26.424,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Many organizations

7
0:00:27.901,000 --> 0:00:29,000
are offering these online courses

8
0:00:30.659,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.

9
0:00:34.689,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Anybody who has an Internet connection

10
0:00:36.249,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the will to learn can access these great courses

11
0:00:38.777,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from excellent universities

12
0:00:40.871,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and get a credential at the end of it.

13
0:00:44.128,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, in this discussion today,

14
0:00:46.752,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm going to focus

15
0:00:47.987,000 --> 0:00:5,000
on a different aspect of MOOCs.

16
0:00:51.255,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We are taking what we are learning

17
0:00:53.606,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the technologies we are developing in the large

18
0:00:56.171,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and applying them in the small

19
0:00:58.271,000 --> 0:01:,000
to create a blended model of education

20
0:01:01.25,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to really reinvent and reimagine

21
0:01:03.043,000 --> 0:01:05,000
what we do in the classroom.

22
0:01:05.47,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, our classrooms could use change.

23
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So, here's a classroom

24
0:01:10.401,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at this little three-letter institute

25
0:01:12.426,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the Northeast of America, MIT.

26
0:01:15.21,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,

27
0:01:17.529,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and this is a classroom today.

28
0:01:20.996,000 --> 0:01:23,000
What's changed?

29
0:01:24.116,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The seats are in color.

30
0:01:26.663,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Whoop-de-do.

31
0:01:29.791,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Education really hasn't changed

32
0:01:32.502,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in the past 500 years.

33
0:01:34.197,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The last big innovation in education

34
0:01:36.528,000 --> 0:01:39,000
was the printing press and the textbooks.

35
0:01:40.01,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Everything else has changed around us.

36
0:01:41.42,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You know, from healthcare to transportation,

37
0:01:43.243,000 --> 0:01:47,000
everything is different, but education hasn't changed.

38
0:01:47.736,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's also been a real issue in terms of access.

39
0:01:50.409,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So what you see here

40
0:01:52.036,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is not a rock concert.

41
0:01:54.538,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And the person you see at the end of the stage

42
0:01:57.084,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is not Madonna.

43
0:01:59.144,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is a classroom

44
0:02:00.773,000 --> 0:02:04,000
at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.

45
0:02:05.191,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, we've all heard of distance education,

46
0:02:09.127,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but the students way in the back,

47
0:02:10.495,000 --> 0:02:12,000
200 feet away from the instructor,

48
0:02:12.607,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I think they are undergoing long-distance education.

49
0:02:17.502,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, I really believe

50
0:02:19.177,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that we can transform education,

51
0:02:21.392,000 --> 0:02:23,000
both in quality and scale and access,

52
0:02:24.238,000 --> 0:02:26,000
through technology.

53
0:02:26.546,000 --> 0:02:29,000
For example, at edX,

54
0:02:30.241,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we are trying to transform education

55
0:02:32.494,000 --> 0:02:35,000
through online technologies.

56
0:02:35.654,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Given education has been calcified for 500 years,

57
0:02:38.913,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we really cannot think about reengineering it,

58
0:02:41.104,000 --> 0:02:42,000
micromanaging it.

59
0:02:42.249,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We really have to completely reimagine it.

60
0:02:44.557,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.

61
0:02:48.598,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Even the infrastructure has to change.

62
0:02:50.121,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Everything has to change.

63
0:02:51.734,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard

64
0:02:55.099,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to online exercises, online videos.

65
0:02:57.707,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories

66
0:03:00.188,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and gamification.

67
0:03:01.837,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We have to go to completely online grading

68
0:03:03.748,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and peer interaction and discussion boards.

69
0:03:06.501,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Everything really has to change.

70
0:03:08.782,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So at edX and a number of other organizations,

71
0:03:11.288,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we are applying these technologies to education

72
0:03:13.447,000 --> 0:03:16,000
through MOOCs to really increase access to education.

73
0:03:16.633,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And you heard of this example,

74
0:03:18.35,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where, when we launched our very first course --

75
0:03:20.966,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and this was an MIT-hard

76
0:03:22.732,000 --> 0:03:23,000
circuits and electronics course --

77
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
about a year and a half ago,

78
0:03:27.014,000 --> 0:03:32,000
155,000 students from 162 countries

79
0:03:32.317,000 --> 0:03:33,000
enrolled in this course.

80
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we had no marketing budget.

81
0:03:36.706,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, 155,000 is a big number.

82
0:03:40.194,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This number is bigger

83
0:03:41.933,000 --> 0:03:43,000
than the total number of alumni of MIT

84
0:03:44.564,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in its 150-year history.

85
0:03:48.389,000 --> 0:03:5,000
7,200 students passed the course,

86
0:03:50.547,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and this was a hard course.

87
0:03:53.01,000 --> 0:03:56,000
7,200 is also a big number.

88
0:03:56.464,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,

89
0:04:00.006,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I would have to teach for 40 years

90
0:04:02.883,000 --> 0:04:04,000
before I could teach this many students.

91
0:04:05.485,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now these large numbers

92
0:04:07.023,000 --> 0:04:09,000
are just one part of the story.

93
0:04:09.181,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,

94
0:04:11.843,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the other side of MOOCs,

95
0:04:13.068,000 --> 0:04:15,000
take a different perspective.

96
0:04:15.247,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We are taking what we develop and learn in the large

97
0:04:18.182,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and applying it in the small

98
0:04:19.727,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to the classroom, to create a blended model of learning.

99
0:04:23.723,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.

100
0:04:28.326,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,

101
0:04:32.41,000 --> 0:04:35,000
she stopped speaking English,

102
0:04:35.777,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and she began speaking this new language.

103
0:04:38.838,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I call it teen-lish.

104
0:04:41.644,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's a digital language.

105
0:04:43.856,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.

106
0:04:50.57,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"Honey, come over for dinner."

107
0:04:53.886,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Hmm."

108
0:04:55.481,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Did you hear me?"

109
0:04:57.615,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Silence. (Laughter)

110
0:04:59.878,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Can you listen to me?"

111
0:05:01.25,000 --> 0:05:02,000
&quot;Hmm.&quot;

112
0:05:02.622,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So we had a real issue with communicating,

113
0:05:04.578,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and we were just not communicating,

114
0:05:06.846,000 --> 0:05:09,000
until one day I had this epiphany.

115
0:05:09.86,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I texted her. (Laughter)

116
0:05:12.523,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I got an instant response.

117
0:05:14.841,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I said, no, that must have been by accident.

118
0:05:16.526,000 --> 0:05:17,000
She must have thought, you know,

119
0:05:17.613,000 --> 0:05:19,000
some friend of hers was calling her.

120
0:05:19.9,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So I texted her again. Boom, another response.

121
0:05:22.997,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I said, this is great.

122
0:05:24.806,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And so since then, our life has changed.

123
0:05:26.862,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I text her, she responds.

124
0:05:28.42,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's just been absolutely great.

125
0:05:30.922,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

126
0:05:36.777,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So our millennial generation

127
0:05:38.747,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is built differently.

128
0:05:40.381,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, I'm older, and my youthful looks might belie that,

129
0:05:42.882,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but I'm not in the millennial generation.

130
0:05:46.738,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But our kids are really different.

131
0:05:48.37,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The millennial generation is completely comfortable

132
0:05:50.229,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with online technology.

133
0:05:51.469,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So why are we fighting it in the classroom?

134
0:05:53.498,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it.

135
0:05:55.131,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,

136
0:05:56.82,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I can't text very well --

137
0:05:58.469,000 --> 0:06:,000
but I'm willing to bet that with evolution,

138
0:06:00.636,000 --> 0:06:02,000
our kids and their grandchildren

139
0:06:02.881,000 --> 0:06:03,000
will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs

140
0:06:04.711,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to text much better,

141
0:06:06.094,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that evolution will fix all of that stuff.

142
0:06:08.954,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But what if we embraced technology,

143
0:06:10.725,000 --> 0:06:12,000
embraced the millennial generation's

144
0:06:13.329,000 --> 0:06:14,000
natural predilections,

145
0:06:14.594,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and really think about creating these online technologies,

146
0:06:17.639,000 --> 0:06:18,000
blend them into their lives.

147
0:06:19.073,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So here's what we can do.

148
0:06:20.896,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,

149
0:06:23.388,000 --> 0:06:25,000
herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --

150
0:06:25.96,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,

151
0:06:28.718,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so why are we forcing our kids to do that?

152
0:06:30.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So instead what you do

153
0:06:31.974,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is you have them watch videos

154
0:06:33.994,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and do interactive exercises

155
0:06:35.805,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,

156
0:06:38.494,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the dining room, in the bathroom,

157
0:06:40.355,000 --> 0:06:42,000
wherever they're most creative.

158
0:06:42.932,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Then they come into the classroom

159
0:06:44.927,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for some in-person interaction.

160
0:06:48.351,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They can have discussions amongst themselves.

161
0:06:50.188,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They can solve problems together.

162
0:06:51.764,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They can work with the professor

163
0:06:52.91,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and have the professor answer their questions.

164
0:06:55.904,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In fact, with edX, when we were teaching our first course

165
0:06:59.767,000 --> 0:07:01,000
on circuits and electronics around the world,

166
0:07:02.193,000 --> 0:07:04,000
this was happening unbeknownst to us.

167
0:07:04.572,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Two high school teachers

168
0:07:06.111,000 --> 0:07:09,000
at the Sant High School in Mongolia

169
0:07:09.793,000 --> 0:07:11,000
had flipped their classroom,

170
0:07:11.94,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and they were using our video lectures

171
0:07:14.219,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and interactive exercises,

172
0:07:16.092,000 --> 0:07:17,000
where the learners in the high school,

173
0:07:17.703,000 --> 0:07:18,000
15-year-olds, mind you,

174
0:07:19.288,000 --> 0:07:2,000
would go and do these things in their own homes

175
0:07:21.122,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they would come into class,

176
0:07:22.469,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and as you see from this image here,

177
0:07:24.405,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they would interact with each other

178
0:07:25.491,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and do some physical laboratory work.

179
0:07:27.828,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And the only way we discovered this

180
0:07:29.149,000 --> 0:07:3,000
was they wrote a blog

181
0:07:30.572,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and we happened to stumble upon that blog.

182
0:07:34.595,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We were also doing other pilots.

183
0:07:36.702,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So we did a pilot experimental blended courses,

184
0:07:39.184,000 --> 0:07:41,000
working with San Jose State University in California,

185
0:07:42.156,000 --> 0:07:43,000
again, with the circuits and electronics course.

186
0:07:44.003,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You'll hear that a lot. That course has become

187
0:07:46.471,000 --> 0:07:49,000
sort of like our petri dish of learning.

188
0:07:49.947,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So there, the students would, again,

189
0:07:52.215,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the instructors flipped the classroom,

190
0:07:54.942,000 --> 0:07:55,000
blended online and in person,

191
0:07:56.663,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the results were staggering.

192
0:07:58.971,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.

193
0:08:01.613,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more,

194
0:08:04.101,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but the early results are incredible.

195
0:08:06.262,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So traditionally, semester upon semester,

196
0:08:08.659,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for the past several years, this course,

197
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
again, a hard course,

198
0:08:12.689,000 --> 0:08:15,000
had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent

199
0:08:15.805,000 --> 0:08:16,000
every semester.

200
0:08:17.305,000 --> 0:08:19,000
With this blended class late last year,

201
0:08:20.003,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the failure rate fell to nine percent.

202
0:08:23.984,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So the results can be extremely, extremely good.

203
0:08:27.747,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now before we go too far into this,

204
0:08:30.974,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'd like to spend some time discussing

205
0:08:33.626,000 --> 0:08:34,000
some key ideas.

206
0:08:34.775,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What are some key ideas

207
0:08:35.986,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that makes all of this work?

208
0:08:38.843,000 --> 0:08:4,000
One idea is active learning.

209
0:08:41.07,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The idea here is, rather than have students

210
0:08:43.51,000 --> 0:08:45,000
walk into class and watch lectures,

211
0:08:45.696,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we replace this with what we call lessons.

212
0:08:48.738,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Lessons are interleaved sequences

213
0:08:50.982,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of videos and interactive exercises.

214
0:08:53.663,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video

215
0:08:56.842,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and follow that with an interactive exercise.

216
0:08:59.882,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education.

217
0:09:03.027,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You teach by asking questions.

218
0:09:05.007,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And this is a form of learning

219
0:09:06.511,000 --> 0:09:07,000
called active learning,

220
0:09:07.788,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,

221
0:09:11.067,000 --> 0:09:12,000
by Craik and Lockhart,

222
0:09:12.585,000 --> 0:09:13,000
where they said and discovered

223
0:09:14.106,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that learning and retention really relates strongly

224
0:09:16.486,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to the depth of mental processing.

225
0:09:18.235,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Students learn much better

226
0:09:19.727,000 --> 0:09:22,000
when they are interacting with the material.

227
0:09:22.915,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The second idea is self-pacing.

228
0:09:25.693,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, when I went to a lecture hall,

229
0:09:27.329,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and if you were like me,

230
0:09:28.619,000 --> 0:09:29,000
by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.

231
0:09:30.585,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I wasn't all that smart, and I would be scrambling, taking notes,

232
0:09:34.165,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour.

233
0:09:37.356,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,

234
0:09:39.826,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we offer videos and interactive engagements to students?

235
0:09:43.694,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They can hit the pause button.

236
0:09:45.425,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They can rewind the professor.

237
0:09:47.916,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Heck, they can even mute the professor.

238
0:09:51.015,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So this form of self-pacing

239
0:09:53.069,000 --> 0:09:55,000
can be very helpful to learning.

240
0:09:55.694,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The third idea that we have is instant feedback.

241
0:09:59.048,000 --> 0:10:,000
With instant feedback,

242
0:10:00.525,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the computer grades exercises.

243
0:10:02.38,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?

244
0:10:04.675,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Your computer is grading all the exercises.

245
0:10:06.969,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And we've all submitted homeworks,

246
0:10:08.503,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and your grades come back two weeks later,

247
0:10:10.544,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you've forgotten all about it.

248
0:10:12.168,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks

249
0:10:14.245,000 --> 0:10:15,000
from my undergraduate days.

250
0:10:15.73,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Some are never graded.

251
0:10:17.077,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So with instant feedback,

252
0:10:18.571,000 --> 0:10:19,000
students can try to apply answers.

253
0:10:20.061,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.

254
0:10:22.47,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They can try it again and try it again,

255
0:10:24.118,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and this really becomes much more engaging.

256
0:10:26.051,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They get the instant feedback,

257
0:10:27.634,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and this little green check mark that you see here

258
0:10:30.553,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.

259
0:10:34.143,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night

260
0:10:37.047,000 --> 0:10:4,000
dreaming of the green check mark.

261
0:10:40.491,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In fact, one of our learners

262
0:10:42.293,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who took the circuits course early last year,

263
0:10:45.074,000 --> 0:10:46,000
he then went on to take a software course

264
0:10:47.006,000 --> 0:10:49,000
from Berkeley at the end of the year,

265
0:10:49.307,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and this is what the learner had to say

266
0:10:51.453,000 --> 0:10:52,000
on our discussion board

267
0:10:52.725,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when he just started that course

268
0:10:54.251,000 --> 0:10:56,000
about the green check mark:

269
0:10:56.772,000 --> 0:10:58,000
&quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&quot;

270
0:10:58.829,000 --> 0:11:,000
When's the last time you've seen students

271
0:11:01.527,000 --> 0:11:05,000
posting comments like this about homework?

272
0:11:05.988,000 --> 0:11:07,000
My colleague Ed Bertschinger,

273
0:11:08.384,000 --> 0:11:1,000
who heads up the physics department at MIT,

274
0:11:10.554,000 --> 0:11:12,000
has this to say about instant feedback:

275
0:11:13.398,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He indicated that instant feedback

276
0:11:16.399,000 --> 0:11:21,000
turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.

277
0:11:22.174,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The next big idea is gamification.

278
0:11:24.466,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You know, all learners engage really well

279
0:11:26.367,000 --> 0:11:27,000
with interactive videos and so on.

280
0:11:27.876,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You know, they would sit down and shoot

281
0:11:29.141,000 --> 0:11:31,000
alien spaceships all day long until they get it.

282
0:11:31.485,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So we applied these gamification techniques to learning,

283
0:11:34.272,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and we can build these online laboratories.

284
0:11:36.495,000 --> 0:11:38,000
How do you teach creativity? How do you teach design?

285
0:11:38.752,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We can do this through online labs

286
0:11:40.421,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and use computing power

287
0:11:41.698,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to build these online labs.

288
0:11:43.287,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So as this little video shows here,

289
0:11:45.675,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you can engage students

290
0:11:47.14,000 --> 0:11:48,000
much like they design with Legos.

291
0:11:48.747,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So here, the learners are building a circuit

292
0:11:50.665,000 --> 0:11:51,000
with Lego-like ease.

293
0:11:52.556,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And this can also be graded by the computer.

294
0:11:56.647,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Fifth is peer learning.

295
0:11:59.581,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So here, we use discussion forums and discussions

296
0:12:02.416,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and Facebook-like interaction

297
0:12:04.516,000 --> 0:12:05,000
not as a distraction,

298
0:12:06.38,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but to really help students learn.

299
0:12:09.227,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Let me tell you a story.

300
0:12:10.944,000 --> 0:12:13,000
When we did our circuits course

301
0:12:14.17,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for the 155,000 students,

302
0:12:16.036,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I didn't sleep for three nights

303
0:12:17.701,000 --> 0:12:18,000
leading up to the launch of the course.

304
0:12:19.588,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,

305
0:12:22.147,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we're going to be up

306
0:12:23.413,000 --> 0:12:24,000
monitoring the forum, answering questions.

307
0:12:25.287,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They had answered questions for 100 students.

308
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
How do you do that for 150,000?

309
0:12:30.121,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,

310
0:12:32.457,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and I think there's this question

311
0:12:33.678,000 --> 0:12:34,000
from a student from Pakistan,

312
0:12:35.649,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and he asked a question, and I said,

313
0:12:36.977,000 --> 0:12:37,000
okay, let me go and type up an answer,

314
0:12:38.433,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I don't type all that fast,

315
0:12:40.041,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and I begin typing up the answer,

316
0:12:41.605,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and before I can finish,

317
0:12:43.299,000 --> 0:12:45,000
another student from Egypt popped in with an answer,

318
0:12:45.973,000 --> 0:12:46,000
not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,

319
0:12:47.891,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.

320
0:12:49.859,000 --> 0:12:5,000
had popped in with a different answer.

321
0:12:51.468,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And then I sat back, fascinated.

322
0:12:54.268,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were

323
0:12:56.215,000 --> 0:12:57,000
discussing and interacting with each other,

324
0:12:58.166,000 --> 0:13:,000
and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,

325
0:13:00.684,000 --> 0:13:01,000
having this epiphany,

326
0:13:02.152,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and by 4 a.m. in the morning,

327
0:13:03.408,000 --> 0:13:04,000
they had discovered the right answer.

328
0:13:05.161,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And all I had to do was go and bless it,

329
0:13:06.888,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"Good answer."

330
0:13:08.854,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So this is absolutely amazing,

331
0:13:11.206,000 --> 0:13:12,000
where students are learning from each other,

332
0:13:13.016,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and they're telling us that they are learning

333
0:13:15.833,000 --> 0:13:17,000
by teaching.

334
0:13:18.13,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now this is all not just in the future.

335
0:13:20.11,000 --> 0:13:21,000
This is happening today.

336
0:13:21.862,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So we are applying these blended learning pilots

337
0:13:24.179,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in a number of universities and high schools around the world,

338
0:13:26.92,000 --> 0:13:27,000
from Tsinghua in China

339
0:13:28.706,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia

340
0:13:31.138,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to Berkeley in California --

341
0:13:32.749,000 --> 0:13:33,000
all over the world.

342
0:13:34.108,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And these kinds of technologies really help,

343
0:13:36.132,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the blended model can really help

344
0:13:37.681,000 --> 0:13:39,000
revolutionize education.

345
0:13:39.779,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,

346
0:13:43.19,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the business aspect.

347
0:13:44.87,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We can also license these MOOC courses

348
0:13:47.186,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to other universities,

349
0:13:48.925,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,

350
0:13:51.489,000 --> 0:13:53,000
where the university that licenses it with the professor

351
0:13:53.878,000 --> 0:13:54,000
can use these online courses

352
0:13:55.715,000 --> 0:13:57,000
like the next-generation textbook.

353
0:13:57.916,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They can use as much or as little as they like,

354
0:14:00.371,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.

355
0:14:05.857,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Finally, I would like to have you

356
0:14:07.907,000 --> 0:14:09,000
dream with me for a little bit.

357
0:14:10.748,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I would like us to really reimagine education.

358
0:14:14.917,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.

359
0:14:19.042,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We have to move from books to tablets

360
0:14:21.717,000 --> 0:14:22,000
like the Aakash in India

361
0:14:23.543,000 --> 0:14:25,000
or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.

362
0:14:25.891,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The Aakash is 40 dollars.

363
0:14:27.898,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings

364
0:14:30.812,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to digital dormitories.

365
0:14:33.433,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But I think at the end of the day,

366
0:14:34.881,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I think we will still need one lecture hall

367
0:14:37.123,000 --> 0:14:39,000
in our universities.

368
0:14:39.685,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren

369
0:14:42.509,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that your grandparents sat in that room

370
0:14:45.904,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in neat little rows like cornstalks

371
0:14:49.128,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and watched this professor at the end

372
0:14:51.681,000 --> 0:14:53,000
talk about content and, you know,

373
0:14:54.328,000 --> 0:14:56,000
you didn't even have a rewind button?

374
0:14:56.975,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Thank you.

375
0:14:59.203,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

376
0:15:01.194,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

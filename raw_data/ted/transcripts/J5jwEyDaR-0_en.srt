1
0:00:18.042,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007.

2
0:00:22.111,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We made this kindergarten to be a circle.

3
0:00:26.036,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof.

4
0:00:29.179,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you are a parent,

5
0:00:31.699,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you know that kids love to keep making circles.

6
0:00:36.793,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This is how the rooftop looks.

7
0:00:39.6,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And why did we design this?

8
0:00:41.858,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The principal of this kindergarten said,

9
0:00:44.675,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"No, I don't want a handrail."

10
0:00:47.254,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I said, "It's impossible."

11
0:00:49.483,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But he insisted: "How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof?

12
0:00:55.777,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So that it can catch the children falling off?"

13
0:00:57.986,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:59.433,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I said, "It's impossible."

15
0:01:01.97,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And of course, the government official said,

16
0:01:04.889,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Of course you have to have a handrail."

17
0:01:10.324,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But we could keep that idea around the trees.

18
0:01:13.843,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There are three trees popping through.

19
0:01:17.12,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail.

20
0:01:22.745,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But of course, rope has nothing to do with them.

21
0:01:26.017,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They fall into the net.

22
0:01:29.304,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And you get more,

23
0:01:32.355,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and more,

24
0:01:35.292,000 --> 0:01:36,000
more.

25
0:01:36.502,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:37.653,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Sometimes 40 children are around a tree.

27
0:01:43.733,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The boy on the branch,

28
0:01:44.981,000 --> 0:01:46,000
he loves the tree so he is eating the tree.

29
0:01:47.464,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:50.984,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And at the time of an event,

31
0:01:52.785,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they sit on the edge.

32
0:01:56.191,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It looks so nice from underneath.

33
0:01:58.563,000 --> 0:02:,000
Monkeys in the zoo.

34
0:02:00.652,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:04.552,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Feeding time.

36
0:02:06.318,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

37
0:02:12.784,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And we made the roof as low as possible,

38
0:02:15.313,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because we wanted to see children on top of the roof,

39
0:02:19.757,000 --> 0:02:21,000
not only underneath the roof.

40
0:02:22.438,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling.

41
0:02:27.699,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the leg washing place -- there are many kinds of water taps.

42
0:02:32.656,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You see with the flexible tubes,

43
0:02:34.434,000 --> 0:02:36,000
you want to spray water to your friends,

44
0:02:37.329,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the shower,

45
0:02:39.044,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and the one in front is quite normal.

46
0:02:41.541,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But if you look at this,

47
0:02:43.087,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the boy is not washing his boots,

48
0:02:44.917,000 --> 0:02:45,000
he's putting water into his boots.

49
0:02:46.591,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:53.423,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This kindergarten is completely open, most of the year.

51
0:02:59.699,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And there is no boundary between inside and outside.

52
0:03:03.339,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So it means basically this architecture is a roof.

53
0:03:07.978,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And also there is no boundary between classrooms.

54
0:03:11.267,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.

55
0:03:15.59,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When you put many children in a quiet box,

56
0:03:21.415,000 --> 0:03:24,000
some of them get really nervous.

57
0:03:24.733,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But in this kindergarten,

58
0:03:26.985,000 --> 0:03:29,000
there is no reason they get nervous.

59
0:03:30.415,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Because there is no boundary.

60
0:03:33.225,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And the principal says

61
0:03:35.422,000 --> 0:03:39,000
if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room,

62
0:03:39.425,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we let him go.

63
0:03:41.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
He will come back eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back.

64
0:03:44.279,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:48.561,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But the point is, in that kind of occasion,

66
0:03:51.556,000 --> 0:03:53,000
usually children try to hide somewhere.

67
0:03:54.407,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But here, just they leave and come back.

68
0:03:58.986,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's a natural process.

69
0:04:00.836,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And secondly, we consider noise very important.

70
0:04:07.711,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You know that children sleep better in noise.

71
0:04:14.142,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They don't sleep in a quiet space.

72
0:04:17.986,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And in this kindergarten,

73
0:04:20.236,000 --> 0:04:25,000
these children show amazing concentration in class.

74
0:04:27.193,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise.

75
0:04:33.66,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They need noise.

76
0:04:35.663,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And you know, you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar.

77
0:04:39.967,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You are not supposed to be in silence.

78
0:04:43.928,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And you know, these days

79
0:04:46.095,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we are trying to make everything under control.

80
0:04:52.219,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You know, it's completely open.

81
0:04:54.021,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And you should know that

82
0:04:57.033,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.

83
0:05:02.818,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In summer you go swimming.

84
0:05:05.922,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The sand is 50 degrees.

85
0:05:08.636,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And also, you should know that you are waterproof.

86
0:05:12.029,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You never melt in rain.

87
0:05:15.181,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So, children are supposed to be outside.

88
0:05:19.05,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So that is how we should treat them.

89
0:05:22.251,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is how they divide classrooms.

90
0:05:24.923,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They are supposed to help teachers.

91
0:05:27.426,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They don't.

92
0:05:29.731,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:35.226,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I didn't put him in.

94
0:05:39.522,000 --> 0:05:41,000
A classroom.

95
0:05:42.196,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And a washbasin.

96
0:05:44.655,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They talk to each other around the well.

97
0:05:49.082,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And there are always some trees in the classroom.

98
0:05:55.969,000 --> 0:05:58,000
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above.

99
0:05:59.377,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:01.225,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Monkeys.

101
0:06:02.829,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

102
0:06:04.283,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And each classroom has at least one skylight.

103
0:06:09.468,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas.

104
0:06:19.255,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is the annex building,

105
0:06:21.682,000 --> 0:06:25,000
right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten.

106
0:06:26.151,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors.

107
0:06:31.81,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And of course, the ceiling height is very low.

108
0:06:33.971,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So you have to consider safety.

109
0:06:38.036,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So, we put our children, a daughter and a son.

110
0:06:43.707,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They tried to go in.

111
0:06:47.731,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He hit his head.

112
0:06:51.343,000 --> 0:06:54,000
He's okay. His skull is quite strong.

113
0:06:55.312,000 --> 0:06:58,000
He is resilient. It's my son.

114
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

115
0:07:01.038,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off.

116
0:07:05.038,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And then we put other children.

117
0:07:12.835,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know.

118
0:07:15.376,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

119
0:07:16.528,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The driver in front, she needs to learn how to drive.

120
0:07:21.379,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now these days,

121
0:07:23.91,000 --> 0:07:27,000
kids need a small dosage of danger.

122
0:07:30.97,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And in this kind of occasion,

123
0:07:33.375,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they learn to help each other.

124
0:07:37.3,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days.

125
0:07:48.065,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now, this drawing is showing the movement of a boy

126
0:07:54.976,000 --> 0:08:,000
between 9:10 and 9:30.

127
0:08:01.3,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And the circumference of this building is 183 meters.

128
0:08:07.501,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So it's not exactly small at all.

129
0:08:11.353,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning.

130
0:08:15.959,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But the surprise is yet to come.

131
0:08:19.551,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average.

132
0:08:27.455,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And these children have the highest athletic abilities

133
0:08:34.435,000 --> 0:08:37,000
among many kindergartens.

134
0:08:43.39,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The principal says,

135
0:08:45.016,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof.

136
0:08:51.353,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Just like sheep."

137
0:08:52.972,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

138
0:08:54.401,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They keep running.

139
0:08:56.23,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:58.779,000 --> 0:09:03,000
My point is don't control them,

141
0:09:03.838,000 --> 0:09:06,000
don't protect them too much,

142
0:09:07.06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they need to tumble sometimes.

143
0:09:10.687,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They need to get some injury.

144
0:09:14.473,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And that makes them learn

145
0:09:17.892,000 --> 0:09:2,000
how to live in this world.

146
0:09:23.848,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I think architecture is capable of changing this world,

147
0:09:31.057,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and people's lives.

148
0:09:33.909,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children.

149
0:09:40.481,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Thank you very much.

150
0:09:42.158,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Applause)

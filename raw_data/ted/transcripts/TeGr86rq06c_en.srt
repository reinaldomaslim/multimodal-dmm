1
0:00:12.621,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What if I told you there was a new technology

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that, when placed in the hands of doctors and nurses,

3
0:00:21.112,000 --> 0:00:26,000
improved outcomes for children and adults, patients of all ages;

4
0:00:27.311,000 --> 0:00:29,000
reduced pain and suffering,

5
0:00:29.878,000 --> 0:00:32,000
reduced time in the operating rooms,

6
0:00:33.091,000 --> 0:00:35,000
reduced anesthetic times,

7
0:00:35.968,000 --> 0:00:36,000
had the ultimate dose-response curve

8
0:00:37.89,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that the more you did it,

9
0:00:39.66,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the better it benefitted patients?

10
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Here's a kicker: it has no side effects,

11
0:00:45.586,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it's available no matter where care is delivered.

12
0:00:49.325,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I can tell you as an ICU doctor at Boston Children's Hospital,

13
0:00:52.791,000 --> 0:00:54,000
this would be a game changer for me.

14
0:00:55.122,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That technology is lifelike rehearsal.

15
0:01:00.533,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This lifelike rehearsal is being delivered through medical simulation.

16
0:01:05.711,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I thought I would start with a case,

17
0:01:09.736,000 --> 0:01:11,000
just to really describe the challenge ahead,

18
0:01:12.47,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and why this technology is not just going to improve health care

19
0:01:15.865,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but why it's critical to health care.

20
0:01:19.388,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is a child that's born, young girl.

21
0:01:22.285,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Day of life zero," we call it,

22
0:01:24.069,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the first day of life, just born into the world.

23
0:01:26.392,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And just as she's being born,

24
0:01:27.807,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we notice very quickly that she is deteriorating.

25
0:01:30.759,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Her heart rate is going up, her blood pressure is going down,

26
0:01:33.696,000 --> 0:01:34,000
she's breathing very, very fast.

27
0:01:36.097,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And the reason for this is displayed in this chest X-ray.

28
0:01:41.023,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That's called a babygram,

29
0:01:42.358,000 --> 0:01:45,000
a full X-ray of a child's body, a little infant's body.

30
0:01:45.656,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As you look on the top side of this,

31
0:01:47.586,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that's where the heart and lungs are supposed to be.

32
0:01:50.093,000 --> 0:01:52,000
As you look at the bottom end, that's where the abdomen is,

33
0:01:52.894,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that's where the intestines are supposed to be.

34
0:01:55.34,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And you can see how there's sort of that translucent area

35
0:01:58.093,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that made its way up into the right side of this child's chest.

36
0:02:01.288,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And those are the intestines -- in the wrong place.

37
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
As a result, they're pushing on the lungs

38
0:02:07.514,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and making it very difficult for this poor baby to breathe.

39
0:02:11.038,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The fix for this problem

40
0:02:12.555,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is to take this child immediately to the operating room,

41
0:02:15.233,000 --> 0:02:17,000
bring those intestines back into the abdomen,

42
0:02:17.388,000 --> 0:02:18,000
let the lungs expand

43
0:02:18.827,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and allow this child to breathe again.

44
0:02:21.307,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But before she can go to the operating room,

45
0:02:23.39,000 --> 0:02:26,000
she must get whisked away to the ICU, where I work.

46
0:02:26.706,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I work with surgical teams.

47
0:02:28.598,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We gather around her,

48
0:02:29.924,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and we place this child on heart-lung bypass.

49
0:02:35.416,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We put her to sleep,

50
0:02:37.061,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we make a tiny little incision in the neck,

51
0:02:39.681,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we place catheters into the major vessels of the neck --

52
0:02:42.843,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I can tell you that these vessels are about the size of a pen,

53
0:02:46.561,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the tip of a pen --

54
0:02:48.49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and then we have blood drawn from the body,

55
0:02:50.598,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we bring it through a machine, it gets oxygenated,

56
0:02:53.03,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it goes back into the body.

57
0:02:54.906,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We save her life,

58
0:02:56.506,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and get her safely to the operating room.

59
0:03:00.87,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Here's the problem:

60
0:03:03.692,000 --> 0:03:04,000
these disorders --

61
0:03:05.289,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what is known is congenital diaphragmatic hernia --

62
0:03:08.602,000 --> 0:03:11,000
this hole in the diaphragm that has allowed these intestines to sneak up --

63
0:03:12.222,000 --> 0:03:13,000
these disorders are rare.

64
0:03:15.113,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Even in the best hands in the world,

65
0:03:18.962,000 --> 0:03:21,000
there is still a challenge to get the volume --

66
0:03:22.496,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the natural volume of these patients --

67
0:03:24.418,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in order to get our expertise curve at 100 percent.

68
0:03:26.964,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They just don't present that often.

69
0:03:30.549,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So how do you make the rare common?

70
0:03:35.921,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Here's the other problem:

71
0:03:38.179,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in the health care system that I trained for over 20 years,

72
0:03:42.804,000 --> 0:03:43,000
what currently exists,

73
0:03:44.013,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the model of training is called the apprenticeship model.

74
0:03:46.981,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's been around for centuries.

75
0:03:48.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It's based on this idea that you see a surgery maybe once,

76
0:03:52.892,000 --> 0:03:53,000
maybe several times,

77
0:03:54.444,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you then go do that surgery,

78
0:03:57.258,000 --> 0:04:,000
and then ultimately you teach that surgery to the next generation.

79
0:04:02.262,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And implicit in this model --

80
0:04:05.036,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I don't need to tell you this --

81
0:04:07.234,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is that we practice on the very patients that we are delivering care to.

82
0:04:14.123,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That's a problem.

83
0:04:19.096,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I think there's a better approach.

84
0:04:21.317,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Medicine may very well be the last high-stakes industry

85
0:04:25.706,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that does not practice prior to game time.

86
0:04:30.128,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I want to describe to you a better approach through medical simulation.

87
0:04:36.139,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, the first thing we did is we went to other high-stakes industries

88
0:04:39.54,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that had been using this type of methodology for decades.

89
0:04:42.434,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is nuclear power.

90
0:04:44.123,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Nuclear power runs scenarios on a regular basis

91
0:04:48.188,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in order to practice what they hope will never occur.

92
0:04:51.932,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And as we're all very familiar, the airline industry --

93
0:04:55.804,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we all get on planes now, comforted by the idea

94
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that pilots and crews have trained on simulators much like these,

95
0:05:04.945,000 --> 0:05:06,000
training on scenarios that we hope will never occur,

96
0:05:07.53,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but we know if they did,

97
0:05:09.734,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they would be prepared for the worst.

98
0:05:12.75,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In fact, the airline industry has gone as far as to create fuselages

99
0:05:17.179,000 --> 0:05:18,000
of simulation environments,

100
0:05:18.746,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because of the importance of the team coming together.

101
0:05:22.633,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is an evacuation drill simulator.

102
0:05:25.526,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So again, if that ever were to happen, these rare, rare events,

103
0:05:29.417,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they're ready to act on the drop of a dime.

104
0:05:34.706,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I guess the most compelling for me in some ways is the sports industry --

105
0:05:40.048,000 --> 0:05:41,000
arguably high stakes.

106
0:05:42.293,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You think about a baseball team: baseball players practice.

107
0:05:45.578,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I think it's a beautiful example of progressive training.

108
0:05:48.273,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The first thing they do is go out to spring training.

109
0:05:51.057,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They go to a spring training camp,

110
0:05:53.345,000 --> 0:05:55,000
perhaps a simulator in baseball.

111
0:05:56.392,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They're not on the real field, but they're on a simulated field,

112
0:05:59.458,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and they're playing in the pregame season.

113
0:06:01.515,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Then they make their way to the field during the season games,

114
0:06:05.036,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and what's the first thing they do before they start the game?

115
0:06:08.158,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They go into the batting cage and do batting practice for hours,

116
0:06:12.613,000 --> 0:06:15,000
having different types of pitches being thrown at them,

117
0:06:15.968,000 --> 0:06:19,000
hitting ball after ball as they limber their muscles,

118
0:06:20.324,000 --> 0:06:21,000
getting ready for the game itself.

119
0:06:22.321,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And here's the most phenomenal part of this,

120
0:06:26.345,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and for all of you who watch any sport event,

121
0:06:28.869,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you will see this phenomenon happen.

122
0:06:31.661,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The batter gets into the batter's box,

123
0:06:34.373,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the pitcher gets ready to pitch.

124
0:06:36.518,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Right before the pitch is thrown,

125
0:06:39.648,000 --> 0:06:4,000
what does that batter do?

126
0:06:40.881,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The batter steps out of the box

127
0:06:44.097,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and takes a practice swing.

128
0:06:46.164,000 --> 0:06:47,000
He wouldn't do it any other way.

129
0:06:49.212,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I want to talk to you about how we're building practice swings like this

130
0:06:52.651,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in medicine.

131
0:06:53.83,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We are building batting cages for the patients that we care about

132
0:06:58.036,000 --> 0:06:59,000
at Boston Children's.

133
0:06:59.288,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I want to use this case that we recently built.

134
0:07:02.304,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's the case of a four-year-old who had a progressively enlarging head,

135
0:07:06.599,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and as a result,

136
0:07:07.9,000 --> 0:07:1,000
had loss of developmental milestones, neurologic milestones,

137
0:07:11.056,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the reason for this problem is here --

138
0:07:14.097,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it's called hydrocephalus.

139
0:07:16.372,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So, a quick study in neurosurgery.

140
0:07:19.267,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There's the brain,

141
0:07:20.456,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and you can see the cranium surrounding the brain.

142
0:07:23.469,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What surrounds the brain, between the brain and cranium,

143
0:07:26.837,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is something called cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,

144
0:07:30.079,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which acts as a shock absorber.

145
0:07:32.406,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In your heads right now,

146
0:07:33.752,000 --> 0:07:36,000
there is cerebrospinal fluid just bathing your brains

147
0:07:37.033,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and making its way around.

148
0:07:38.883,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's produced in one area and flows through,

149
0:07:41.533,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and then is re-exchanged.

150
0:07:42.848,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And this beautiful flow pattern occurs for all of us.

151
0:07:46.265,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But unfortunately in some children,

152
0:07:48.334,000 --> 0:07:5,000
there's a blockage of this flow pattern,

153
0:07:50.861,000 --> 0:07:51,000
much like a traffic jam.

154
0:07:52.885,000 --> 0:07:54,000
As a result, the fluid accumulates,

155
0:07:55.732,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the brain is pushed aside.

156
0:07:58.947,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It has difficulty growing.

157
0:08:01.421,000 --> 0:08:04,000
As a result, the child loses neurologic milestones.

158
0:08:04.938,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is a devastating disease in children.

159
0:08:08.793,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The cure for this is surgery.

160
0:08:11.891,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The traditional surgery is to take a bit of the cranium off,

161
0:08:14.825,000 --> 0:08:15,000
a bit of the skull,

162
0:08:16.007,000 --> 0:08:18,000
drain this fluid out, stick a drain in place,

163
0:08:18.974,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and then eventually bring this drain internal to the body.

164
0:08:21.726,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Big operation.

165
0:08:23.916,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But some great news is that advances in neurosurgical care

166
0:08:28.257,000 --> 0:08:31,000
have allowed us to develop minimally invasive approaches

167
0:08:31.99,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to this surgery.

168
0:08:33.174,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Through a small pinhole, a camera can be inserted,

169
0:08:38.752,000 --> 0:08:4,000
led into the deep brain structure,

170
0:08:41.504,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and cause a little hole in a membrane that allows all that fluid to drain,

171
0:08:45.481,000 --> 0:08:47,000
much like it would in a sink.

172
0:08:47.553,000 --> 0:08:5,000
All of a sudden, the brain is no longer under pressure,

173
0:08:50.692,000 --> 0:08:51,000
can re-expand

174
0:08:52.173,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we cure the child through a single-hole incision.

175
0:08:56.478,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But here's the problem:

176
0:08:57.917,000 --> 0:08:59,000
hydrocephalus is relatively rare.

177
0:09:00.73,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And there are no good training methods

178
0:09:03.164,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to get really good at getting this scope to the right place.

179
0:09:06.812,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But surgeons have been quite creative about this, even our own.

180
0:09:11.15,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And they've come up with training models.

181
0:09:13.182,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Here's the current training model.

182
0:09:14.931,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:16.913,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I kid you not.

184
0:09:18.594,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is a red pepper, not made in Hollywood;

185
0:09:21.057,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it's real red pepper.

186
0:09:22.82,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And what surgeons do is they stick a scope into the pepper,

187
0:09:25.791,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they do what is called a "seedectomy."

188
0:09:28.913,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:30.704,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They use this scope to remove seeds using a little tweezer.

190
0:09:37.632,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And that is a way to get under their belts

191
0:09:40.284,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the rudimentary components of doing this surgery.

192
0:09:43.936,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Then they head right into the apprenticeship model,

193
0:09:46.396,000 --> 0:09:48,000
seeing many of them as they present themselves,

194
0:09:49.292,000 --> 0:09:51,000
then doing it, and then teaching it --

195
0:09:51.579,000 --> 0:09:53,000
waiting for these patients to arrive.

196
0:09:54.347,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We can do a lot better.

197
0:09:55.91,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We are manufacturing reproductions of children

198
0:10:00.661,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in order for surgeons and surgical teams to rehearse

199
0:10:04.591,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in the most relevant possible ways.

200
0:10:06.995,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Let me show you this.

201
0:10:08.966,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Here's my team

202
0:10:10.498,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in what's called the SIM Engineering Division of the Simulator Program.

203
0:10:15.14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is an amazing team of individuals.

204
0:10:18.007,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They are mechanical engineers;

205
0:10:20.306,000 --> 0:10:22,000
you're seeing here, illustrators.

206
0:10:22.755,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They take primary data from CT scans and MRIs,

207
0:10:27.351,000 --> 0:10:3,000
translate it into digital information,

208
0:10:30.705,000 --> 0:10:31,000
animate it,

209
0:10:32.035,000 --> 0:10:36,000
put it together into the components of the child itself,

210
0:10:36.85,000 --> 0:10:39,000
surface-scan elements of the child that have been casted as needed,

211
0:10:40.668,000 --> 0:10:42,000
depending on the surgery itself,

212
0:10:43.277,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and then take this digital data and be able to output it

213
0:10:47.192,000 --> 0:10:5,000
on state-of-the-art, three-dimensional printing devices

214
0:10:50.964,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that allow us to print the components

215
0:10:53.258,000 --> 0:10:58,000
exactly to the micron detail of what the child's anatomy will look like.

216
0:10:58.95,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You can see here,

217
0:11:00.278,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the skull of this child being printed

218
0:11:02.736,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the hours before we performed this surgery.

219
0:11:06.438,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But we could not do this work

220
0:11:09.038,000 --> 0:11:13,000
without our dear friends on the West Coast in Hollywood, California.

221
0:11:14.6,000 --> 0:11:17,000
These are individuals that are incredibly talented

222
0:11:17.854,000 --> 0:11:19,000
at being able to recreate reality.

223
0:11:20.302,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It was not a long leap for us.

224
0:11:24.75,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The more we got into this field,

225
0:11:26.35,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the more it became clear to us that we are doing cinematography.

226
0:11:30.81,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We're doing filmmaking,

227
0:11:32.711,000 --> 0:11:34,000
it's just that the actors are not actors.

228
0:11:35.729,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They're real doctors and nurses.

229
0:11:39.01,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So these are some photos of our dear friends at Fractured FX

230
0:11:42.413,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in Hollywood California,

231
0:11:43.906,000 --> 0:11:46,000
an Emmy-Award-winning special effects firm.

232
0:11:47.504,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This is Justin Raleigh and his group --

233
0:11:50.698,000 --> 0:11:51,000
this is not one of our patients --

234
0:11:52.37,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:53.752,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but kind of the exquisite work that these individuals do.

236
0:11:56.844,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We have now collaborated and fused our experience,

237
0:12:00.472,000 --> 0:12:02,000
bringing their group to Boston Children's Hospital,

238
0:12:02.902,000 --> 0:12:04,000
sending our group out to Hollywood, California

239
0:12:05.582,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and exchanging around this

240
0:12:06.975,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to be able to develop these type of simulators.

241
0:12:10.002,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What I'm about to show you is a reproduction of this child.

242
0:12:18.992,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You'll notice here that every hair on the child's head is reproduced.

243
0:12:24.144,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And in fact, this is also that reproduced child --

244
0:12:27.871,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,

245
0:12:31.088,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but that is a reproduction and simulation

246
0:12:33.972,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of the child they're about to operate on.

247
0:12:38.313,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Here's that membrane we had talked about,

248
0:12:40.775,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the inside of this child's brain.

249
0:12:43.358,000 --> 0:12:47,000
What you're going to be seeing here is, on one side, the actual patient,

250
0:12:48.35,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and on the other side, the simulator.

251
0:12:50.653,000 --> 0:12:54,000
As I mentioned, a scope, a little camera, needs to make its way down,

252
0:12:55.027,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and you're seeing that here.

253
0:12:56.452,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It needs to make a small hole in this membrane

254
0:12:58.8,000 --> 0:13:,000
and allow this fluid to seep out.

255
0:13:02.975,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I won't do a quiz show to see who thinks which side is which,

256
0:13:08.782,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but on the right is the simulator.

257
0:13:12.503,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So surgeons can now produce training opportunities,

258
0:13:16.325,000 --> 0:13:19,000
do these surgeries as many times as they want,

259
0:13:19.402,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to their heart's content, until they feel comfortable.

260
0:13:22.268,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And then, and only then, bring the child into the operating room.

261
0:13:25.857,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But we don't stop here.

262
0:13:27.05,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We know that a key step to this is not just the skill itself,

263
0:13:31.384,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but combining that skill with a team who's going to deliver that care.

264
0:13:35.939,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now we turn to Formula One.

265
0:13:38.845,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And here is an example of a technician putting on a tire

266
0:13:42.119,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and doing that time and time again on this car.

267
0:13:45.352,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But that is very quickly going to be incorporated

268
0:13:48.361,000 --> 0:13:49,000
within team-training experiences,

269
0:13:50.316,000 --> 0:13:54,000
now as a full team orchestrating the exchange of tires

270
0:13:54.549,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and getting this car back on the speedway.

271
0:13:58.094,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We've done that step in health care,

272
0:14:01.395,000 --> 0:14:05,000
so now what you're about to see is a simulated operation.

273
0:14:06.58,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We've taken the simulator I just described to you,

274
0:14:08.991,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we've brought it into the operating room at Boston Children's Hospital,

275
0:14:12.416,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and these individuals -- these native teams, operative teams --

276
0:14:16.095,000 --> 0:14:19,000
are doing the surgery before the surgery.

277
0:14:19.642,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Operate twice;

278
0:14:21.403,000 --> 0:14:22,000
cut once.

279
0:14:22.939,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Let me show that to you.

280
0:14:25.237,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Video) Surgical team member 1: You want the head down or head up?

281
0:14:28.374,000 --> 0:14:29,000
STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?

282
0:14:30.102,000 --> 0:14:32,000
STM 3: And then lower the whole table down a little bit?

283
0:14:32.775,000 --> 0:14:33,000
STM 4: Table coming down.

284
0:14:36.676,000 --> 0:14:38,000
STM 3: All right, this is behaving like a vessel.

285
0:14:39.405,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Could we have the scissors back, please?

286
0:14:41.516,000 --> 0:14:44,000
STM 5: I'm taking my gloves, 8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.

287
0:14:44.841,000 --> 0:14:46,000
STM 6: Great! Thank you.

288
0:14:48.156,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.

289
0:14:50.013,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The second step to this, which is critical,

290
0:14:52.129,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is we take these teams out immediately and debrief them.

291
0:14:55.252,000 --> 0:14:56,000
We use the same technologies

292
0:14:56.74,000 --> 0:15:,000
that are used in Lean and Six Sigma in the military,

293
0:15:01.452,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and we bring them out and talk about what went right,

294
0:15:04.561,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but more importantly,

295
0:15:06.23,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we talk about what didn't go well,

296
0:15:08.721,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and how we're going to fix it.

297
0:15:10.68,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Then we bring them right back in and do it again.

298
0:15:13.458,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Deliberative batting practice in the moments when it matters most.

299
0:15:20.258,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Let's go back to this case now.

300
0:15:22.903,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Same child,

301
0:15:24.304,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but now let me describe how we care for this child

302
0:15:26.718,000 --> 0:15:27,000
at Boston Children's Hospital.

303
0:15:28.205,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This child was born at three o'clock in the morning.

304
0:15:30.715,000 --> 0:15:32,000
At two o'clock in the morning,

305
0:15:32.746,000 --> 0:15:34,000
we assembled the team,

306
0:15:34.896,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and took the reproduced anatomy

307
0:15:36.721,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that we would gain out of scans and images,

308
0:15:40.45,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and brought that team to the virtual bedside,

309
0:15:43.24,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to a simulated bedside --

310
0:15:44.851,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the same team that's going to operate on this child in the hours ahead --

311
0:15:48.416,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and we have them do the procedure.

312
0:15:51.411,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Let me show you a moment of this.

313
0:15:54.032,000 --> 0:15:56,000
This is not a real incision.

314
0:15:57.271,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And the baby has not yet been born.

315
0:16:00.933,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Imagine this.

316
0:16:03.953,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So now the conversations that I have with families

317
0:16:07.865,000 --> 0:16:09,000
in the intensive care unit at Boston Children's Hospital

318
0:16:10.589,000 --> 0:16:11,000
are totally different.

319
0:16:12.582,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Imagine this conversation:

320
0:16:15.469,000 --> 0:16:19,000
"Not only do we take care of this disorder frequently in our ICU,

321
0:16:20.344,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and not only have we done surgeries

322
0:16:22.546,000 --> 0:16:24,000
like the surgery we're going to do on your child,

323
0:16:25.005,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but we have done your child's surgery.

324
0:16:29.776,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And we did it two hours ago.

325
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And we did it 10 times.

326
0:16:35.086,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And now we're prepared to take them back to the operating room."

327
0:16:40.551,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So a new technology in health care:

328
0:16:43.987,000 --> 0:16:45,000
lifelike rehearsal.

329
0:16:46.879,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Practicing prior to game time.

330
0:16:51.452,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Thank you.

331
0:16:52.656,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

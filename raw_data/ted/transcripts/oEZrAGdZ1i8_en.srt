1
0:00:25.579,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,

2
0:00:28.254,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which is to choose a lighthearted theme.

3
0:00:31.398,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Last time, I talked about death and dying.

4
0:00:33.752,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:34.778,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.

6
0:00:37.225,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:38.853,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But it has to be technological,

8
0:00:40.587,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.

9
0:00:42.993,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:45.156,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You know, ever since man had any notion

11
0:00:48.816,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that some of his other people, his colleagues,

12
0:00:52.888,000 --> 0:00:55,000
could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed

13
0:00:56.443,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or what we now recognize as schizophrenia,

14
0:01:00.338,000 --> 0:01:05,000
he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits

15
0:01:05.419,000 --> 0:01:06,000
getting into the body.

16
0:01:06.595,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So the way of treating these diseases in early times

17
0:01:09.894,000 --> 0:01:12,000
was to, in some way or other, exorcise those evil spirits.

18
0:01:12.991,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And this is still going on, as you know.

19
0:01:16.305,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But it wasn't enough to use the priests.

20
0:01:18.443,000 --> 0:01:22,000
When medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,

21
0:01:23.157,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with Hippocrates and those boys,

22
0:01:25.079,000 --> 0:01:28,000
they tried to look for herbs, plants

23
0:01:28.918,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that would literally shake the bad spirits out.

24
0:01:32.326,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.

25
0:01:35.801,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And the herbals,

26
0:01:37.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages, the Renaissance,

27
0:01:42.497,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions

28
0:01:46.905,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to shake the evil spirits out.

29
0:01:50.549,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Finally, in about the 16th century,

30
0:01:54.286,000 --> 0:02:,000
a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim --

31
0:02:00.54,000 --> 0:02:04,000
called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here --

32
0:02:04.619,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:07.221,000 --> 0:02:08,000
good old Paracelsus --

34
0:02:09.198,000 --> 0:02:12,000
found that he could predict the degree of convulsion

35
0:02:13.144,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.

36
0:02:17.366,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Can you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball

37
0:02:20.249,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and chewing on it if you're feeling depressed?

38
0:02:22.759,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it.

39
0:02:25.291,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:26.317,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So, what we see in the 17th, 18th century

41
0:02:29.774,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.

42
0:02:34.744,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin,

43
0:02:36.604,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and he comes close to convulsing himself

44
0:02:38.612,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.

45
0:02:42.186,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.

46
0:02:47.109,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And then we fast-forward to about 1932,

47
0:02:51.355,000 --> 0:02:56,000
when three Italian psychiatrists who were largely treating depression

48
0:02:57.178,000 --> 0:03:,000
began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,

49
0:03:01.107,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that if they had a series of epileptic fits, a lot of them in a row --

50
0:03:05.581,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the depression would very frequently lift.

51
0:03:07.641,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Not only would it lift, but it might never return.

52
0:03:11.37,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So they got very interested in producing convulsions,

53
0:03:16.173,000 --> 0:03:17,000
measured types of convulsions.

54
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And they thought,

55
0:03:19.189,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.

56
0:03:22.245,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot."

57
0:03:24.97,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.

58
0:03:28.089,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So they went to the police and they said,

59
0:03:30.718,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"We know that at the Rome railroad station,

60
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:34,000
there are all these lost souls wandering around,

61
0:03:35.483,000 --> 0:03:36,000
muttering gibberish.

62
0:03:36.699,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Can you bring one of them to us?"

63
0:03:39.311,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Someone who is, as the Italians say, "gagootz."

64
0:03:42.42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So they found this "gagootz" guy,

65
0:03:44.434,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,

66
0:03:47.738,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who was known, had been known for months,

67
0:03:50.72,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to be literally defecating on himself,

68
0:03:53.811,000 --> 0:03:55,000
talking nothing that made any sense,

69
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and they brought him into the hospital.

70
0:03:58.527,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So these three psychiatrists,

71
0:04:00.137,000 --> 0:04:02,000
after about two or three weeks of observation,

72
0:04:02.421,000 --> 0:04:04,000
laid him down on a table,

73
0:04:04.964,000 --> 0:04:08,000
connected his temples to a very small source of current.

74
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second.

75
0:04:13.289,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That's not going to do anything terrible to him."

76
0:04:15.884,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So they did that.

77
0:04:17.464,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer,

78
0:04:21.413,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who told me this about 35 years ago,

79
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine.

80
0:04:29.264,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He said, "This fellow" -- remember, he wasn't even put to sleep --

81
0:04:33.507,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"after this major grand mal convulsion,

82
0:04:35.773,000 --> 0:04:36,000
sat right up,

83
0:04:37.108,000 --> 0:04:38,000
looked at these three fellas and said,

84
0:04:39.117,000 --> 0:04:42,000
'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?'"

85
0:04:42.197,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:50.242,000 --> 0:04:52,000
If I could only say that in Italian.

87
0:04:52.347,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:53.752,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Well, they were happy as could be,

89
0:04:55.922,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.

90
0:05:00.166,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:02.238,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So they plugged him in again,

92
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and this time, they used 110 volts for half a second.

93
0:05:10.042,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And to their amazement, after it was over,

94
0:05:12.113,000 --> 0:05:14,000
he began speaking like he was perfectly well.

95
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
He relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,

96
0:05:18.169,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and he was essentially cured.

97
0:05:19.606,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But of course, having schizophrenia,

98
0:05:22.224,000 --> 0:05:24,000
within a few months, it returned.

99
0:05:24.508,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But they wrote a paper about this,

100
0:05:26.837,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and everybody in the western world began using electricity

101
0:05:31.127,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to convulse people who were either schizophrenic

102
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or severely depressed.

103
0:05:34.861,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,

104
0:05:37.129,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s

105
0:05:40.922,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective

106
0:05:46.34,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the treatment of depression.

107
0:05:47.951,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,

108
0:05:51.263,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it became very, very popular.

109
0:05:54.148,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They would anesthetize people, convulse them ...

110
0:05:57.294,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles.

111
0:06:01.374,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So people would have a real grand mal seizure.

112
0:06:04.824,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Bones were broken; especially in old, fragile people, you couldn't use it.

113
0:06:09.597,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And then in the late 1950s, the so-called "muscle relaxants"

114
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
were developed by pharmacologists,

115
0:06:16.268,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,

116
0:06:19.728,000 --> 0:06:22,000
an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves --

117
0:06:23.643,000 --> 0:06:25,000
without causing any convulsion in the body

118
0:06:25.882,000 --> 0:06:27,000
except a little bit of twitching of the toes.

119
0:06:28.216,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful.

120
0:06:33.627,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Well, you know, in the middle '60s, the first antidepressants came out.

121
0:06:38.916,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Tofranil was the first.

122
0:06:40.743,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,

123
0:06:43.753,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and they were very effective.

124
0:06:45.464,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset

125
0:06:48.438,000 --> 0:06:5,000
about the kinds of things that they would witness,

126
0:06:51.129,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,

127
0:06:57.977,000 --> 0:07:,000
but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.

128
0:07:01.095,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the reason that it has had a renaissance

129
0:07:03.899,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,

130
0:07:09.513,000 --> 0:07:12,000
do not respond, regardless of what is done for them.

131
0:07:14.808,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now why am I telling you this story at this meeting?

132
0:07:19.101,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm telling you this story because, actually,

133
0:07:21.526,000 --> 0:07:24,000
ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about --

134
0:07:24.632,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as he asked all of his speakers --

135
0:07:26.326,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to talk about something that would be new to this audience

136
0:07:29.407,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that we had never talked about, never written about.

137
0:07:32.246,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I've been planning this moment.

138
0:07:34.92,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,

139
0:07:41.534,000 --> 0:07:47,000
had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.

140
0:07:48.322,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And let me tell you this story.

141
0:07:52.322,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I was, in the 1960s, in a marriage.

142
0:07:56.434,000 --> 0:08:,000
To use the word "bad" would be perhaps the understatement of the year.

143
0:08:00.622,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It was dreadful.

144
0:08:03.343,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room

145
0:08:06.87,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.

146
0:08:12.202,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood,

147
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:18,000
a very difficult adolescence --

148
0:08:18.572,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it had to do with not quite poverty, but close.

149
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,

150
0:08:25.923,000 --> 0:08:26,000
no one could read or write English.

151
0:08:27.687,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.

152
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I was a little prone to depression.

153
0:08:33.258,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,

154
0:08:37.42,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years

155
0:08:41.926,000 --> 0:08:42,000
trying to save this marriage,

156
0:08:43.54,000 --> 0:08:46,000
which was inevitably not to be saved.

157
0:08:47.525,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Finally, I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases,

158
0:08:52.891,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,

159
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.

160
0:09:01.493,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.

161
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I couldn't even pull the covers off myself.

162
0:09:07.732,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Well, you're in a university medical center,

163
0:09:10.028,000 --> 0:09:11,000
where everybody knows everybody.

164
0:09:11.638,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it's perfectly clear to my colleagues, so my referrals began to decrease.

165
0:09:15.727,000 --> 0:09:17,000
As my referrals began to decrease,

166
0:09:17.912,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I clearly became increasingly depressed,

167
0:09:21.709,000 --> 0:09:23,000
until I thought, "My God, I can't work anymore."

168
0:09:24.579,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And, in fact, it didn't make any difference,

169
0:09:26.674,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because I didn't have any patients anymore.

170
0:09:28.723,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, with the advice of my physician,

171
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit

172
0:09:35.619,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of our university hospital.

173
0:09:37.512,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And my colleagues, who had known me since medical school,

174
0:09:40.208,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in that place, said, "Don't worry, Shep.

175
0:09:42.395,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Six weeks, you're back in the operating room.

176
0:09:44.567,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Everything's going to be great."

177
0:09:46.467,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, you know what bovine stercus is?

178
0:09:49.642,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.

179
0:09:53.239,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:56.587,000 --> 0:10:,000
I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.

181
0:10:01.335,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

182
0:10:04.103,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter and applause)

183
0:10:06.913,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So I was one of their failures.

184
0:10:10.296,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But it wasn't that simple,

185
0:10:11.783,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because by the time I got out of that unit,

186
0:10:14.094,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I was not functional at all.

187
0:10:16.541,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.

188
0:10:19.803,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.

189
0:10:22.819,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I rarely bathed.

190
0:10:24.306,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I sometimes didn't shave.

191
0:10:25.948,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It was dreadful.

192
0:10:27.507,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And it was clear -- not to me,

193
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore --

194
0:10:33.454,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that I would need long-term hospitalization

195
0:10:37.431,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in that awful place called a "mental hospital."

196
0:10:41.21,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So I was admitted, in the spring of 1973,

197
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.

198
0:10:50.562,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It was founded in the 18th century,

199
0:10:52.3,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut,

200
0:10:56.693,000 --> 0:10:59,000
other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time.

201
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And they tried everything they had.

202
0:11:02.754,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They tried the usual psychotherapy.

203
0:11:04.496,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They tried every medication available in those days.

204
0:11:06.96,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And they did have Tofranil and other things -- Mellaril, who knows what.

205
0:11:10.947,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.

206
0:11:15.399,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And finally,

207
0:11:17.585,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because I was well-known in Connecticut,

208
0:11:21.998,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.

209
0:11:24.864,000 --> 0:11:28,000
All the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened.

210
0:11:30.896,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They put all their heads together,

211
0:11:33.274,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and they decided that there was nothing that could be done

212
0:11:36.922,000 --> 0:11:4,000
for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,

213
0:11:41.56,000 --> 0:11:44,000
who by that time had become so overwhelmed,

214
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:5,000
not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy,

215
0:11:50.576,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but with obsessional thinking,

216
0:11:52.752,000 --> 0:11:54,000
obsessional thinking about coincidences.

217
0:11:55.111,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,

218
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:04,000
just got me dreadfully upset, all kinds of ritualistic observances ...

219
0:12:04.744,000 --> 0:12:05,000
just awful, awful stuff.

220
0:12:06.367,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Remember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?

221
0:12:09.455,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,

222
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.

223
0:12:17.223,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch, "The Scream."

224
0:12:21.334,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Every moment was a scream; it was impossible.

225
0:12:24.727,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So they decided there was no therapy, there was no treatment.

226
0:12:27.772,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But there was one treatment,

227
0:12:29.417,000 --> 0:12:32,000
which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford Hospital

228
0:12:33.178,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in the early 1940s,

229
0:12:35.407,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and you can imagine what it was: it was prefrontal lobotomy.

230
0:12:40.01,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Imitates a popping sound)

231
0:12:42.904,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So they decided -- I didn't know this, again, I found this out later --

232
0:12:46.357,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that the only thing that could be done

233
0:12:48.209,000 --> 0:12:53,000
was for this 43-year-old man to have a prefrontal lobotomy.

234
0:12:54.595,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Well, as in all hospitals,

235
0:12:56.541,000 --> 0:12:58,000
there was a resident assigned to my case.

236
0:12:59.422,000 --> 0:13:,000
He was 27 years old,

237
0:13:00.934,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and he would meet with me two or three times a week.

238
0:13:03.694,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.

239
0:13:07.138,000 --> 0:13:1,000
He asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him,

240
0:13:10.638,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because he was very well thought of in that place.

241
0:13:13.043,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They thought he had a really extraordinary future.

242
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And he dug in his heels and said,

243
0:13:17.617,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"No. I know this man better than any of you.

244
0:13:19.76,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I have met with him over and over again.

245
0:13:21.721,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.

246
0:13:25.344,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,

247
0:13:29.783,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.

248
0:13:33.057,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a prefrontal lobotomy.

249
0:13:36.501,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Any of the results along the spectrum,

250
0:13:39.646,000 --> 0:13:43,000
from pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible, is going to happen.

251
0:13:43.67,000 --> 0:13:45,000
If he does the best he can,

252
0:13:46.382,000 --> 0:13:47,000
he will have no further obsessions,

253
0:13:48.094,000 --> 0:13:49,000
probably no depression,

254
0:13:49.889,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but his affect will be dulled,

255
0:13:51.471,000 --> 0:13:52,000
he will never go back to surgery,

256
0:13:53.186,000 --> 0:13:56,000
he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,

257
0:13:57.093,000 --> 0:13:58,000
his life will be changed.

258
0:13:58.323,000 --> 0:14:,000
If he has the usual result,

259
0:14:00.617,000 --> 0:14:03,000
he'll end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'

260
0:14:03.859,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life."

261
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:13,000
"Well," he said, "can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?"

262
0:14:13.265,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And you know why they agreed?

263
0:14:14.912,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They agreed to humor him.

264
0:14:16.664,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10.

265
0:14:21.034,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference."

266
0:14:25.177,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So they gave the course of 10,

267
0:14:26.909,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and the first -- the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight,

268
0:14:30.029,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and still is six to eight --

269
0:14:32.076,000 --> 0:14:36,000
plugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.

270
0:14:36.276,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Six didn't work. Seven didn't work. Eight didn't work.

271
0:14:39.254,000 --> 0:14:41,000
At nine, I noticed --

272
0:14:42.119,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it's wonderful that I could notice anything --

273
0:14:44.327,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I noticed a change.

274
0:14:45.642,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And at 10, I noticed a real change.

275
0:14:48.119,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And he went back to them,

276
0:14:49.346,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and they agreed to do another 10.

277
0:14:50.954,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Again, not a single one of them --

278
0:14:52.913,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I think there are about seven or eight of them --

279
0:14:55.272,000 --> 0:14:56,000
thought this would do any good.

280
0:14:56.776,000 --> 0:14:57,000
They thought this was a temporary change.

281
0:14:58.764,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,

282
0:15:01.814,000 --> 0:15:04,000
there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.

283
0:15:05.275,000 --> 0:15:07,000
By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.

284
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense,

285
0:15:13.006,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that I could overcome this,

286
0:15:14.723,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that I was now strong enough that by an act of will,

287
0:15:18.029,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I could blow the obsessional thinking away.

288
0:15:20.362,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I could blow the depression away.

289
0:15:23.414,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And I've never forgotten -- I never will forget --

290
0:15:25.784,000 --> 0:15:28,000
standing in the kitchen of the unit --

291
0:15:29.078,000 --> 0:15:33,000
it was a Sunday morning in January of 1974 --

292
0:15:33.322,000 --> 0:15:35,000
standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking,

293
0:15:35.825,000 --> 0:15:38,000
"I've got the strength now to do this."

294
0:15:38.948,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected,

295
0:15:44.101,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and I could think clearly.

296
0:15:46.736,000 --> 0:15:47,000
But I need a formula.

297
0:15:48.01,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I need some thing to say to myself

298
0:15:51.74,000 --> 0:15:54,000
when I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.

299
0:15:55.811,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room

300
0:16:00.593,000 --> 0:16:01,000
will remember "Ruddigore,"

301
0:16:02.027,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they will remember Mad Margaret,

302
0:16:03.772,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and they will remember that she was married

303
0:16:05.813,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to a fella named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.

304
0:16:08.747,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And she used to go nuts every five minutes or so in the play.

305
0:16:12.759,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And he said to her, "We must have a word to bring you back to reality,

306
0:16:16.542,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'"

307
0:16:20.38,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So every time she got a little nuts, he would say, "Basingstoke!"

308
0:16:23.737,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And she would say, "Basingstoke, it is!" And she'd be fine for a little while.

309
0:16:27.454,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Laughter)

310
0:16:28.483,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke."

311
0:16:31.431,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Laughter)

312
0:16:32.468,000 --> 0:16:33,000
But I had something better.

313
0:16:34.661,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And it was very simple.

314
0:16:36.461,000 --> 0:16:38,000
It was, "Ah, fuck it!"

315
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Laughter)

316
0:16:41.87,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Much better than "Basingstoke,"

317
0:16:43.886,000 --> 0:16:44,000
at least for me.

318
0:16:45.805,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And it worked! My God, it worked.

319
0:16:48.106,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally --

320
0:16:50.514,000 --> 0:16:53,000
again, once more, after 20 shock treatments --

321
0:16:55.313,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I would say, "Ah, fuck it."

322
0:16:58.217,000 --> 0:17:,000
And things got better and better,

323
0:17:00.754,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and within three or four months,

324
0:17:03.117,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I was discharged from that hospital.

325
0:17:04.967,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I joined a group of surgeons, where I could work with other people,

326
0:17:09.608,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in a community, not in New Haven, but fairly close by.

327
0:17:13.195,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I stayed there for three years.

328
0:17:15.123,000 --> 0:17:19,000
At the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,

329
0:17:19.683,000 --> 0:17:21,000
had remarried by that time.

330
0:17:23.273,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.

331
0:17:29.446,000 --> 0:17:3,000
My children

332
0:17:32.02,000 --> 0:17:33,000
came back

333
0:17:34.191,000 --> 0:17:35,000
to live with us.

334
0:17:35.367,000 --> 0:17:37,000
We had two more children after that.

335
0:17:37.96,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Resuscitated the career,

336
0:17:40.996,000 --> 0:17:42,000
even better than it had been before.

337
0:17:43.544,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Went right back into the university

338
0:17:47.404,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and began to write books.

339
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Well, you know,

340
0:17:51.971,000 --> 0:17:52,000
it's been a wonderful life.

341
0:17:53.333,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.

342
0:17:57.429,000 --> 0:18:,000
I stopped doing surgery about six years ago

343
0:18:00.628,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and became a full-time writer, as many people know.

344
0:18:04.237,000 --> 0:18:06,000
But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy.

345
0:18:06.638,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Every once in a while, I have to say, "Ah, fuck it."

346
0:18:09.533,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Every once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.

347
0:18:13.029,000 --> 0:18:15,000
So, I'm not free of all of this.

348
0:18:17.692,000 --> 0:18:19,000
But it's worked. It's always worked.

349
0:18:21.698,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Why have I chosen,

350
0:18:25.132,000 --> 0:18:29,000
after never, ever talking about this,

351
0:18:29.216,000 --> 0:18:3,000
to talk about it now?

352
0:18:30.729,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Well, those of you who know some of these books

353
0:18:33.655,000 --> 0:18:35,000
know that one is about death and dying,

354
0:18:36.386,000 --> 0:18:38,000
one is about the human body and the human spirit,

355
0:18:38.763,000 --> 0:18:42,000
one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds.

356
0:18:43.34,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And they have always to do with my own personal experiences.

357
0:18:48.874,000 --> 0:18:5,000
One might think reading these books --

358
0:18:51.37,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and I've gotten thousands of letters about them

359
0:18:53.653,000 --> 0:18:55,000
by people who do think this --

360
0:18:56.189,000 --> 0:18:59,000
that, based on my life's history as I portray it in the books,

361
0:18:59.814,000 --> 0:19:,000
my early life's history,

362
0:19:01.082,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I am someone who has overcome adversity,

363
0:19:04.827,000 --> 0:19:08,000
that I am someone who has drunk -- drank? -- drunk

364
0:19:09.845,000 --> 0:19:15,000
of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood

365
0:19:16.412,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.

366
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I really have it figured out

367
0:19:22.709,000 --> 0:19:24,000
so that I can advise people about death and dying,

368
0:19:25.116,000 --> 0:19:27,000
so that I can talk about mysticism

369
0:19:27.339,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and the human spirit.

370
0:19:28.726,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And I've always felt guilty about that.

371
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:34,000
I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor,

372
0:19:34.387,000 --> 0:19:38,000
because my readers don't know what I have just told you.

373
0:19:39.203,000 --> 0:19:41,000
It's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,

374
0:19:41.667,000 --> 0:19:43,000
but it is not generally known.

375
0:19:44.374,000 --> 0:19:5,000
So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today

376
0:19:50.638,000 --> 0:19:53,000
is to -- frankly, selfishly --

377
0:19:53.667,000 --> 0:19:57,000
unburden myself and let it be known

378
0:19:57.807,000 --> 0:20:02,000
that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.

379
0:20:03.088,000 --> 0:20:04,000
But more importantly, I think,

380
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:09,000
is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience

381
0:20:09.863,000 --> 0:20:1,000
are under 30,

382
0:20:12.177,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and there are many, of course, who are well over 30.

383
0:20:17.706,000 --> 0:20:18,000
For people under 30,

384
0:20:19.18,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and it looks to me like almost all of you, I would say all of you,

385
0:20:22.433,000 --> 0:20:25,000
are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career

386
0:20:26.226,000 --> 0:20:3,000
or right into a magnificent and exciting career:

387
0:20:31.564,000 --> 0:20:32,000
anything can happen to you.

388
0:20:33.07,000 --> 0:20:34,000
Things change.

389
0:20:34.799,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Accidents happen.

390
0:20:36.39,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.

391
0:20:39.081,000 --> 0:20:4,000
You can be thrown off the track.

392
0:20:40.888,000 --> 0:20:42,000
I hope it happens to none of you,

393
0:20:42.955,000 --> 0:20:45,000
but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you.

394
0:20:47.068,000 --> 0:20:5,000
To those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.

395
0:20:52.248,000 --> 0:20:56,000
If I, with the bleakness of spirit -- with no spirit --

396
0:20:57.218,000 --> 0:21:,000
that I had in the 1970s,

397
0:21:00.343,000 --> 0:21:02,000
and no possibility of recovery

398
0:21:03.062,000 --> 0:21:07,000
as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,

399
0:21:07.369,000 --> 0:21:09,000
if I can find my way back from this,

400
0:21:10.1,000 --> 0:21:13,000
believe me, anybody can find their way back

401
0:21:13.457,000 --> 0:21:16,000
from any adversity that exists in their lives.

402
0:21:17.437,000 --> 0:21:18,000
And for those who are older,

403
0:21:18.819,000 --> 0:21:21,000
who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this,

404
0:21:22.411,000 --> 0:21:24,000
but who have lived through difficult times,

405
0:21:24.803,000 --> 0:21:26,000
perhaps where they lost everything, as I did,

406
0:21:27.167,000 --> 0:21:28,000
and started out all over again:

407
0:21:29.038,000 --> 0:21:32,000
some of these things will seem very familiar.

408
0:21:34.106,000 --> 0:21:37,000
There is recovery.

409
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:41,000
There is redemption.

410
0:21:42.709,000 --> 0:21:44,000
And there is resurrection.

411
0:21:46.555,000 --> 0:21:48,000
There are resurrection themes

412
0:21:48.785,000 --> 0:21:5,000
in every society that has ever been studied,

413
0:21:51.558,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and it is because not just only do we fantasize

414
0:21:54.557,000 --> 0:21:56,000
about the possibility of resurrection and recovery,

415
0:21:57.452,000 --> 0:21:58,000
but it actually happens.

416
0:21:59.296,000 --> 0:22:,000
And it happens a lot.

417
0:22:01.538,000 --> 0:22:05,000
Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme,

418
0:22:05.873,000 --> 0:22:07,000
outside of specifically religious ones,

419
0:22:08.683,000 --> 0:22:11,000
is the one about the phoenix, the ancient story of the phoenix,

420
0:22:12.551,000 --> 0:22:14,000
who, every 500 years,

421
0:22:15.083,000 --> 0:22:18,000
resurrects itself from its own ashes

422
0:22:18.824,000 --> 0:22:2,000
to go on to live a life

423
0:22:21.62,000 --> 0:22:24,000
that is even more beautiful than it was before.

424
0:22:25.231,000 --> 0:22:26,000
Richard, thanks very much.

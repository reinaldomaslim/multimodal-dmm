1
0:00:13.268,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the northwest corner of the United States,

2
0:00:16.853,000 --> 0:00:18,000
right up near the Canadian border,

3
0:00:19.727,000 --> 0:00:22,000
there's a little town called Libby, Montana,

4
0:00:23.553,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes

5
0:00:28.038,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and just amazing wildlife

6
0:00:32.761,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky.

7
0:00:38.099,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And in there is a little town called Libby,

8
0:00:41.618,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which I visited, which feels kind of lonely,

9
0:00:45.963,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a little isolated.

10
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And in Libby, Montana, there's a rather unusual woman

11
0:00:52.012,000 --> 0:00:54,000
named Gayla Benefield.

12
0:00:54.039,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She always felt a little bit of an outsider,

13
0:00:56.402,000 --> 0:00:58,000
although she's been there almost all her life,

14
0:00:58.966,000 --> 0:01:,000
a woman of Russian extraction.

15
0:01:01.414,000 --> 0:01:02,000
She told me when she went to school,

16
0:01:03.153,000 --> 0:01:04,000
she was the only girl who ever chose

17
0:01:04.926,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to do mechanical drawing.

18
0:01:08.174,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Later in life, she got a job going house to house

19
0:01:12.072,000 --> 0:01:16,000
reading utility meters -- gas meters, electricity meters.

20
0:01:16.182,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And she was doing the work in the middle of the day,

21
0:01:19.182,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and one thing particularly caught her notice, which was,

22
0:01:22.609,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in the middle of the day she met a lot of men

23
0:01:26.715,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who were at home, middle aged, late middle aged,

24
0:01:31.105,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks.

25
0:01:36.548,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It struck her as strange.

26
0:01:39.311,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Then, a few years later, her father died at the age of 59,

27
0:01:42.922,000 --> 0:01:45,000
five days before he was due to receive his pension.

28
0:01:46.852,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He'd been a miner.

29
0:01:47.94,000 --> 0:01:52,000
She thought he must just have been worn out by the work.

30
0:01:53.382,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But then a few years later, her mother died,

31
0:01:57.114,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that seemed stranger still,

32
0:02:00.131,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because her mother came from a long line of people

33
0:02:02.965,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who just seemed to live forever.

34
0:02:06.826,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day,

35
0:02:10.395,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and learning how to waltz.

36
0:02:12.569,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother

37
0:02:16.004,000 --> 0:02:18,000
should die so young.

38
0:02:18.458,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It was an anomaly, and she kept puzzling over anomalies.

39
0:02:22.702,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And as she did, other ones came to mind.

40
0:02:24.758,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She remembered, for example,

41
0:02:26.486,000 --> 0:02:29,000
when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital,

42
0:02:29.585,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and she had a lot of x-rays,

43
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and two of them were leg x-rays, which made sense,

44
0:02:34.315,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but six of them were chest x-rays, which didn't.

45
0:02:39.125,000 --> 0:02:41,000
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece

46
0:02:42.107,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of her life and her parents' life,

47
0:02:44.483,000 --> 0:02:47,000
trying to understand what she was seeing.

48
0:02:48.484,000 --> 0:02:49,000
She thought about her town.

49
0:02:50.195,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The town had a vermiculite mine in it.

50
0:02:53.183,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners,

51
0:02:56.016,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to make plants grow faster and better.

52
0:02:59.296,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,

53
0:03:02.354,000 --> 0:03:04,000
huge amounts of it put under the roof

54
0:03:05.001,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters.

55
0:03:08.852,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Vermiculite was in the playground.

56
0:03:11.219,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It was in the football ground.

57
0:03:12.672,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It was in the skating rink.

58
0:03:15.105,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What she didn't learn until she started working this problem

59
0:03:18.934,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos.

60
0:03:26.019,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When she figured out the puzzle,

61
0:03:27.798,000 --> 0:03:29,000
she started telling everyone she could

62
0:03:30.704,000 --> 0:03:32,000
what had happened, what had been done to her parents

63
0:03:33.371,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks

64
0:03:36.441,000 --> 0:03:39,000
at home in the afternoons.

65
0:03:39.602,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But she was really amazed.

66
0:03:41.003,000 --> 0:03:44,000
She thought, when everybody knows, they'll want to do something,

67
0:03:44.075,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but actually nobody wanted to know.

68
0:03:46.297,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In fact, she became so annoying

69
0:03:48.412,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as she kept insisting on telling this story

70
0:03:50.849,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to her neighbors, to her friends, to other people in the community,

71
0:03:54.064,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that eventually a bunch of them got together

72
0:03:56.184,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and they made a bumper sticker,

73
0:03:57.692,000 --> 0:04:,000
which they proudly displayed on their cars, which said,

74
0:04:00.96,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,

75
0:04:03.106,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and no, I don't have asbestosis."

76
0:04:08.646,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research.

77
0:04:12.026,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The advent of the Internet definitely helped her.

78
0:04:15.217,000 --> 0:04:16,000
She talked to anybody she could.

79
0:04:17.237,000 --> 0:04:2,000
She argued and argued, and finally she struck lucky

80
0:04:20.512,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when a researcher came through town

81
0:04:22.712,000 --> 0:04:24,000
studying the history of mines in the area,

82
0:04:25.146,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and she told him her story, and at first, of course,

83
0:04:28.288,000 --> 0:04:3,000
like everyone, he didn't believe her,

84
0:04:30.559,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research

85
0:04:33.202,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and he realized that she was right.

86
0:04:37.362,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So now she had an ally.

87
0:04:41.424,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Nevertheless, people still didn't want to know.

88
0:04:44.014,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous,

89
0:04:47.738,000 --> 0:04:5,000
someone would have told us."

90
0:04:50.771,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"If that's really why everyone was dying,

91
0:04:53.793,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the doctors would have told us."

92
0:04:58.369,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said,

93
0:05:01.745,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"I don't want to be a victim.

94
0:05:03.556,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,

95
0:05:05.574,000 --> 0:05:11,000
every industry has its accidents."

96
0:05:12.507,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But still Gayla went on, and finally she succeeded

97
0:05:16.313,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in getting a federal agency to come to town

98
0:05:18.925,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and to screen the inhabitants of the town --

99
0:05:23.213,000 --> 0:05:27,000
15,000 people -- and what they discovered

100
0:05:27.941,000 --> 0:05:3,000
was that the town had a mortality rate

101
0:05:31.36,000 --> 0:05:37,000
80 times higher than anywhere in the United States.

102
0:05:37.418,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That was in 2002, and even at that moment,

103
0:05:41.434,000 --> 0:05:44,000
no one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,

104
0:05:45.124,000 --> 0:05:49,000
look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing.

105
0:05:49.439,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's lined with vermiculite."

106
0:05:54.143,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This wasn't ignorance.

107
0:05:57.21,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was willful blindness.

108
0:05:59.979,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Willful blindness is a legal concept which means,

109
0:06:03.458,000 --> 0:06:05,000
if there's information that you could know and you should know

110
0:06:06.435,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but you somehow manage not to know,

111
0:06:09.862,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the law deems that you're willfully blind.

112
0:06:12.608,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You have chosen not to know.

113
0:06:16.383,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There's a lot of willful blindness around these days.

114
0:06:20.782,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You can see willful blindness in banks,

115
0:06:23.633,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when thousands of people sold mortgages to people

116
0:06:26.69,000 --> 0:06:27,000
who couldn't afford them.

117
0:06:28.398,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You could see them in banks

118
0:06:30.056,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when interest rates were manipulated

119
0:06:32.22,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and everyone around knew what was going on,

120
0:06:34.632,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but everyone studiously ignored it.

121
0:06:37.806,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church,

122
0:06:41.23,000 --> 0:06:45,000
where decades of child abuse went ignored.

123
0:06:45.851,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You could see willful blindness

124
0:06:48.146,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the run-up to the Iraq War.

125
0:06:52.657,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those,

126
0:06:56.296,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and it also exists on very small scales,

127
0:06:59.191,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in people's families, in people's homes and communities,

128
0:07:03.119,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and particularly in organizations and institutions.

129
0:07:08.597,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Companies that have been studied for willful blindness

130
0:07:12.839,000 --> 0:07:14,000
can be asked questions like,

131
0:07:15.122,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"Are there issues at work

132
0:07:17.948,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that people are afraid to raise?"

133
0:07:21.378,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And when academics have done studies like this

134
0:07:23.593,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of corporations in the United States,

135
0:07:25.89,000 --> 0:07:3,000
what they find is 85 percent of people say yes.

136
0:07:31.138,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Eighty-five percent of people know there's a problem,

137
0:07:34.146,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but they won't say anything.

138
0:07:36.221,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And when I duplicated the research in Europe,

139
0:07:39.608,000 --> 0:07:41,000
asking all the same questions,

140
0:07:42.27,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I found exactly the same number.

141
0:07:45.36,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Eighty-five percent. That's a lot of silence.

142
0:07:49.411,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's a lot of blindness.

143
0:07:51.493,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland,

144
0:07:55.137,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they tell me, "This is a uniquely Swiss problem."

145
0:07:58.555,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And when I go to Germany, they say, "Oh yes, this is the German disease."

146
0:08:02.755,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And when I go to companies in England, they say,

147
0:08:05.065,000 --> 0:08:08,000
"Oh, yeah, the British are really bad at this."

148
0:08:08.804,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And the truth is, this is a human problem.

149
0:08:13.474,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We're all, under certain circumstances, willfully blind.

150
0:08:19.839,000 --> 0:08:21,000
What the research shows is that some people are blind

151
0:08:22.387,000 --> 0:08:25,000
out of fear. They're afraid of retaliation.

152
0:08:25.992,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And some people are blind because they think, well,

153
0:08:29.367,000 --> 0:08:31,000
seeing anything is just futile.

154
0:08:31.785,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Nothing's ever going to change.

155
0:08:33.641,000 --> 0:08:35,000
If we make a protest, if we protest against the Iraq War,

156
0:08:36.455,000 --> 0:08:37,000
nothing changes, so why bother?

157
0:08:38.225,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Better not to see this stuff at all.

158
0:08:42.767,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time

159
0:08:45.765,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is people say, "Well, you know,

160
0:08:48.245,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the people who do see, they're whistleblowers,

161
0:08:51.745,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and we all know what happens to them."

162
0:08:54.369,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers

163
0:08:58.418,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which says, first of all, they're all crazy.

164
0:09:02.731,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But what I've found going around the world

165
0:09:05.044,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and talking to whistleblowers is, actually,

166
0:09:08.231,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.

167
0:09:12.986,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for,

168
0:09:16.891,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the reason that they speak up,

169
0:09:19.198,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the reason they insist on seeing,

170
0:09:22.08,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is because they care so much about the institution

171
0:09:25.577,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and want to keep it healthy.

172
0:09:29.163,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And the other thing that people often say

173
0:09:31.326,000 --> 0:09:34,000
about whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point,

174
0:09:34.554,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because you see what happens to them.

175
0:09:37.123,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They are crushed.

176
0:09:38.437,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Nobody would want to go through something like that."

177
0:09:42.179,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,

178
0:09:45.506,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.

179
0:09:50.666,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I think of Joe Darby.

180
0:09:53.051,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib,

181
0:09:56.503,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war

182
0:10:00.225,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that was being fought in Iraq.

183
0:10:02.889,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,

184
0:10:05.9,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the very obedient, good soldier

185
0:10:09.396,000 --> 0:10:13,000
who found those photographs and handed them in.

186
0:10:14.159,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And he said, "You know, I'm not the kind of guy

187
0:10:17.877,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to rat people out, but some things just cross the line.

188
0:10:22.103,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Ignorance is bliss, they say,

189
0:10:24.199,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but you can't put up with things like this."

190
0:10:27.927,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I talked to Steve Bolsin, a British doctor,

191
0:10:30.962,000 --> 0:10:34,000
who fought for five years to draw attention

192
0:10:35.268,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies.

193
0:10:40.291,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I asked him why he did it, and he said,

194
0:10:42.363,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it.

195
0:10:46.449,000 --> 0:10:48,000
She came up to me one night, and she just said,

196
0:10:48.713,000 --> 0:10:51,000
'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"

197
0:10:52.142,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Or I think of Cynthia Thomas,

198
0:10:54.893,000 --> 0:10:57,000
a really loyal army daughter and army wife,

199
0:10:58.878,000 --> 0:11:,000
who, as she saw her friends and relations

200
0:11:01.83,000 --> 0:11:05,000
coming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked

201
0:11:06.132,000 --> 0:11:07,000
by their mental condition

202
0:11:08.02,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge

203
0:11:12.051,000 --> 0:11:14,000
post-traumatic stress syndrome

204
0:11:14.715,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town

205
0:11:20.323,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to give them legal, psychological and medical assistance.

206
0:11:25.953,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret,

207
0:11:28.893,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be

208
0:11:32.686,000 --> 0:11:34,000
when I grow up.

209
0:11:34.974,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But I've found myself in this cause,

210
0:11:39.467,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and I'll never be the same."

211
0:11:44.484,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We all enjoy so many freedoms today,

212
0:11:47.78,000 --> 0:11:48,000
hard-won freedoms:

213
0:11:49.736,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship,

214
0:11:53.204,000 --> 0:11:56,000
a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary;

215
0:11:56.979,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a freedom to vote, which women in particular

216
0:11:59.465,000 --> 0:12:01,000
had to fight so hard for;

217
0:12:01.944,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures

218
0:12:04.826,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and sexual orientation to live the way that they want.

219
0:12:09.782,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it,

220
0:12:14.616,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and what whistleblowers do,

221
0:12:16.957,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and what people like Gayla Benefield do

222
0:12:19.524,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is they use the freedom that they have.

223
0:12:24.13,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And what they're very prepared to do is recognize

224
0:12:27.612,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that yes, this is going to be an argument,

225
0:12:30.242,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows

226
0:12:33.234,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends,

227
0:12:37.223,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but I'm going to become very good at this conflict.

228
0:12:40.445,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I'm going to take on the naysayers,

229
0:12:42.788,000 --> 0:12:46,000
because they'll make my argument better and stronger.

230
0:12:47.708,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I can collaborate with my opponents

231
0:12:50.14,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to become better at what I do.

232
0:12:54.622,000 --> 0:12:56,000
These are people of immense persistence,

233
0:12:57.444,000 --> 0:13:01,000
incredible patience, and an absolute determination

234
0:13:02.347,000 --> 0:13:07,000
not to be blind and not to be silent.

235
0:13:07.818,000 --> 0:13:1,000
When I went to Libby, Montana,

236
0:13:11.011,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I visited the asbestosis clinic

237
0:13:14.372,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that Gayla Benefield brought into being,

238
0:13:18.293,000 --> 0:13:2,000
a place where at first some of the people

239
0:13:21.173,000 --> 0:13:24,000
who wanted help and needed medical attention

240
0:13:24.415,000 --> 0:13:26,000
went in the back door

241
0:13:27.045,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because they didn't want to acknowledge

242
0:13:29.53,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that she'd been right.

243
0:13:31.975,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I sat in a diner, and I watched

244
0:13:35.148,000 --> 0:13:39,000
as trucks drove up and down the highway,

245
0:13:39.176,000 --> 0:13:43,000
carting away the earth out of gardens

246
0:13:43.43,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated soil.

247
0:13:50.342,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I took my 12-year-old daughter with me,

248
0:13:52.602,000 --> 0:13:55,000
because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.

249
0:13:55.989,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"

250
0:13:58.905,000 --> 0:14:,000
I said, "She's not a movie star,

251
0:14:01.09,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and she's not a celebrity, and she's not an expert,

252
0:14:05.377,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and Gayla's the first person who'd say

253
0:14:08.115,000 --> 0:14:1,000
she's not a saint.

254
0:14:11.059,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The really important thing about Gayla

255
0:14:14.199,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is she is ordinary.

256
0:14:16.866,000 --> 0:14:2,000
She's like you, and she's like me.

257
0:14:21.692,000 --> 0:14:26,000
She had freedom, and she was ready to use it."

258
0:14:27.655,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Thank you very much.

259
0:14:29.154,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

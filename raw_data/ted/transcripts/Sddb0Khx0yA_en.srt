1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The electricity powering the lights in this theater

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
was generated just moments ago.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Because the way things stand today,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
electricity demand must be in constant balance

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with electricity supply.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
some tens of megawatts of wind power

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
stopped pouring into the grid,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the difference would have to be made up

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from other generators immediately.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But coal plants, nuclear plants

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
can't respond fast enough.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
A giant battery could.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
With a giant battery,

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that prevents wind and solar

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from contributing to the grid

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You see, the battery

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is the key enabling device here.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
With it, we could draw electricity from the sun

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
even when the sun doesn't shine.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And that changes everything.

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Because then renewables

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
such as wind and solar

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
come out from the wings,

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
here to center stage.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Today I want to tell you about such a device.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's called the liquid metal battery.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's a new form of energy storage

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that I invented at MIT

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
along with a team of my students

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and post-docs.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The OED defines spectrum

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as "The entire range of wavelengths

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of electromagnetic radiation,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of which the range of visible light

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is only a small part."

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So I'm not here today only to tell you

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a solution to one of the world's great problems.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I want to go full spectrum and tell you how,

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in the process of developing

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
this new technology,

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that can serve as lessons for innovation,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
ideas worth spreading.

50
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And you know,

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we can't just conserve our way out;

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we can't just drill our way out;

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we can't bomb our way out.

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we're going to invent our way out,

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
working together.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Applause)

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now let's get started.

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The battery was invented about 200 years ago

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
by a professor, Alessandro Volta,

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at the University of Padua in Italy.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
His invention gave birth to a new field of science,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
electrochemistry,

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and new technologies

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
such as electroplating.

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Perhaps overlooked,

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Volta's invention of the battery

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for the first time also

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
demonstrated the utility of a professor.

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Until Volta, nobody could imagine

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a professor could be of any use.

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Here's the first battery --

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a stack of coins, zinc and silver,

76
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
separated by cardboard soaked in brine.

77
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is the starting point

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for designing a battery --

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
two electrodes,

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in this case metals of different composition,

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and an electrolyte,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in this case salt dissolved in water.

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The science is that simple.

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Admittedly, I've left out a few details.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now I've taught you

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that battery science is straightforward

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the need for grid-level storage

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is compelling,

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but the fact is

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that today there is simply no battery technology

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
capable of meeting

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the demanding performance requirements of the grid --

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
namely uncommonly high power,

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
long service lifetime

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and super-low cost.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We need to think about the problem differently.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We need to think big,

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we need to think cheap.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So let's abandon the paradigm

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of let's search for the coolest chemistry

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
by just making lots and lots of product.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Instead, let's invent

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to the price point of the electricity market.

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So that means

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that certain parts of the periodic table

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are axiomatically off-limits.

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This battery needs to be made

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
out of earth-abundant elements.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
make it out of dirt --

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
preferably dirt

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that's locally sourced.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And we need to be able to build this thing

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
using simple manufacturing techniques and factories

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that don't cost us a fortune.

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So about six years ago,

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I started thinking about this problem.

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And in order to adopt a fresh perspective,

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In fact, I looked to a technology

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that neither stores nor generates electricity,

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but instead consumes electricity,

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
huge amounts of it.

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I'm talking about the production of aluminum.

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The process was invented in 1886

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
by a couple of 22-year-olds --

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Hall in the United States and Heroult in France.

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And just a few short years following their discovery,

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
aluminum changed

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from a precious metal costing as much as silver

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to a common structural material.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's about 50 feet wide

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and recedes about half a mile --

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
row after row of cells

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
that, inside, resemble Volta's battery,

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
with three important differences.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Volta's battery works at room temperature.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's fitted with solid electrodes

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The Hall-Heroult cell

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
operates at high temperature,

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a temperature high enough

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that the aluminum metal product is liquid.

147
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The electrolyte

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is not a solution of salt and water,

149
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but rather salt that's melted.

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's this combination of liquid metal,

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
molten salt and high temperature

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that allows us to send high current through this thing.

153
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That's the economic miracle

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of modern electrometallurgy.

157
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It is this that caught and held my attention

158
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery

159
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that could capture this gigantic economy of scale.

160
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I did.

161
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I made the battery all liquid --

162
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
liquid metals for both electrodes

163
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and a molten salt for the electrolyte.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I'll show you how.

165
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I put low-density

166
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
liquid metal at the top,

167
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,

168
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and molten salt in between.

169
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So now,

170
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
how to choose the metals?

171
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
For me, the design exercise

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
always begins here

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
with the periodic table,

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
enunciated by another professor,

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Dimitri Mendeleyev.

176
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Everything we know

177
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is made of some combination

178
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of what you see depicted here.

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And that includes our own bodies.

180
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I recall the very moment one day

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
when I was searching for a pair of metals

182
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that would meet the constraints

183
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of earth abundance,

184
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
different, opposite density

185
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and high mutual reactivity.

186
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I felt the thrill of realization

187
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
when I knew I'd come upon the answer.

188
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Magnesium for the top layer.

189
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And antimony

190
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
for the bottom layer.

191
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You know, I've got to tell you,

192
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
one of the greatest benefits of being a professor:

193
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
colored chalk.

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So to produce current,

196
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
magnesium loses two electrons

197
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to become magnesium ion,

198
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
which then migrates across the electrolyte,

199
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
accepts two electrons from the antimony,

200
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and then mixes with it to form an alloy.

201
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The electrons go to work

202
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the real world out here,

203
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
powering our devices.

204
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now to charge the battery,

205
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we connect a source of electricity.

206
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It could be something like a wind farm.

207
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And then we reverse the current.

208
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And this forces magnesium to de-alloy

209
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and return to the upper electrode,

210
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
restoring the initial constitution of the battery.

211
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And the current passing between the electrodes

212
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
generates enough heat to keep it at temperature.

213
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's pretty cool,

214
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
at least in theory.

215
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But does it really work?

216
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So what to do next?

217
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We go to the laboratory.

218
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now do I hire seasoned professionals?

219
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
No, I hire a student

220
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and mentor him,

221
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
teach him how to think about the problem,

222
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to see it from my perspective

223
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and then turn him loose.

224
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is that student, David Bradwell,

225
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who, in this image,

226
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.

227
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What I didn't tell David at the time

228
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
was I myself wasn't convinced it would work.

229
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But David's young and he's smart

230
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and he wants a Ph.D.,

231
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and he proceeds to build --

232
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

233
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
He proceeds to build

234
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the first ever liquid metal battery

235
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of this chemistry.

236
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And based on David's initial promising results,

237
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
which were paid

238
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
with seed funds at MIT,

239
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I was able to attract major research funding

240
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
from the private sector

241
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and the federal government.

242
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,

243
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
a mix of graduate students, post-docs

244
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and even some undergraduates.

245
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And I was able to attract really, really good people,

246
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
people who share my passion

247
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
for science and service to society,

248
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
not science and service for career building.

249
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And if you ask these people

250
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
why they work on liquid metal battery,

251
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
their answer would hearken back

252
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to President Kennedy's remarks

253
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
at Rice University in 1962

254
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here --

255
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"We choose to work on grid-level storage,

256
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
not because it is easy,

257
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but because it is hard."

258
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

259
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.

260
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.

261
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I called it the shotglass.

262
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We've operated over 400 of these,

263
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries --

264
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
not just magnesium and antimony.

265
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.

266
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
I call it the hockey puck.

267
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And we got the same remarkable results.

268
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And then it was onto the saucer.

269
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
That's 200 watt-hours.

270
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The technology was proving itself

271
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to be robust and scalable.

272
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us.

273
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So a year and a half ago,

274
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
David and I,

275
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
along with another research staff-member,

276
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
formed a company

277
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to accelerate the rate of progress

278
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and the race to manufacture product.

279
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So today at LMBC,

280
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we're building cells 16 inches in diameter

281
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour --

282
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
1,000 times the capacity

283
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of that initial shotglass cell.

284
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We call that the pizza.

285
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.

286
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.

287
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We call that the bistro table,

288
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.

289
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And one variant of the technology

290
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,

291
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
aggregating the modules into a giant battery

292
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that fits in a 40-foot shipping container

293
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
for placement in the field.

294
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours --

295
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
two million watt-hours.

296
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's enough energy

297
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to meet the daily electrical needs

298
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
of 200 American households.

299
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So here you have it, grid-level storage:

300
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
silent, emissions-free,

301
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
no moving parts,

302
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
remotely controlled,

303
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
designed to the market price point

304
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
without subsidy.

305
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So what have we learned from all this?

306
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

307
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So what have we learned from all this?

308
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Let me share with you

309
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
some of the surprises, the heterodoxies.

310
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They lie beyond the visible.

311
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Temperature:

312
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Conventional wisdom says set it low,

313
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
at or near room temperature,

314
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and then install a control system to keep it there.

315
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Avoid thermal runaway.

316
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature

317
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
with minimum regulation.

318
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises

319
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that come from current surges.

320
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Scaling: Conventional wisdom says

321
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
reduce cost by producing many.

322
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost

323
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
by producing fewer, but they'll be larger.

324
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And finally, human resources:

325
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Conventional wisdom says

326
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
hire battery experts,

327
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
seasoned professionals,

328
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.

329
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
To develop liquid metal battery,

330
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I hired students and post-docs and mentored them.

331
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
In a battery,

332
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I strive to maximize electrical potential;

333
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
when mentoring,

334
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I strive to maximize human potential.

335
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So you see,

336
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
the liquid metal battery story

337
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is more than an account

338
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of inventing technology,

339
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
it's a blueprint

340
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
for inventing inventors, full-spectrum.

341
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000

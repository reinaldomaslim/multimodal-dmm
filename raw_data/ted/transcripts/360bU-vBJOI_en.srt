1
0:00:12.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Our society routinely makes decisions

2
0:00:15.957,000 --> 0:00:17,000
without consulting a quarter of the population.

3
0:00:19.34,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We're making choices about land use, energy production and natural resources

4
0:00:24.687,000 --> 0:00:27,000
without the ideas and experiences of the full community.

5
0:00:28.719,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The car, an inanimate object, has more say over public policy

6
0:00:33.387,000 --> 0:00:34,000
than this group of citizens.

7
0:00:35.807,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Can you guess which group I'm talking about?

8
0:00:38.871,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's children.

9
0:00:42.301,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I work in urban design, and not surprisingly,

10
0:00:45.255,000 --> 0:00:47,000
most cities are designed by adults.

11
0:00:47.698,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Urban planners, architects, developers, politicians,

12
0:00:51.553,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and occasionally, a few loud citizens.

13
0:00:54.736,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four-year-olds,

14
0:00:58.792,000 --> 0:01:01,000
barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers.

15
0:01:03.617,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But today, I want to ask you this:

16
0:01:06.706,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What would happen if we asked children to design our cities?

17
0:01:11.01,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:13.618,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Back in 2009, I was introduced to a small group of people

19
0:01:17.887,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who wanted to start a child-friendly city initiative in Boulder, Colorado.

20
0:01:22.49,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I come from a family of civil rights advocates,

21
0:01:25.49,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I had spent my career until that point

22
0:01:28.315,000 --> 0:01:3,000
working with low-income children and families.

23
0:01:31.315,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I had never heard of a child-friendly city initiative before.

24
0:01:35.641,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I figured its purpose would be to address some of the frustrations

25
0:01:39.657,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I had encountered as the parent of a young child.

26
0:01:43.053,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Perhaps we would advocate for more changing tables in restaurants.

27
0:01:47.141,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Or create indoor play spaces for those cold and rainy days.

28
0:01:51.561,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In other words, make the city more hospitable to children and families.

29
0:01:56.601,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It wasn't until after I committed to this project

30
0:02:00.173,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that I realized I had it all wrong.

31
0:02:03.411,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We wouldn't be designing better cities for children.

32
0:02:07.323,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Children would be designing better cities for themselves,

33
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and for the rest of us, too.

34
0:02:14.474,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, I bet you're skeptical about this idea.

35
0:02:18.204,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And honestly, I was, too.

36
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I mean, there must be a reason the voting age is 18.

37
0:02:24.982,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:28.188,000 --> 0:02:31,000
How could children possibly understand complex ideas

39
0:02:31.503,000 --> 0:02:33,000
such as the affordable housing crisis

40
0:02:33.911,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or how to develop a transportation master plan?

41
0:02:37.935,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And even if they had ideas, wouldn't they be childish?

42
0:02:41.688,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Or unreasonable?

43
0:02:44.069,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Do our cities really need a park made out of candy?

44
0:02:47.577,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:51.093,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Or a bridge with water cannons

46
0:02:53.093,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that fire water onto unsuspecting kayakers below?

47
0:02:56.854,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

48
0:03:01.44,000 --> 0:03:03,000
While these concerns sound legitimate,

49
0:03:04.038,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I realized that not including children in city planning

50
0:03:07.331,000 --> 0:03:08,000
was a bigger design problem.

51
0:03:09.728,000 --> 0:03:13,000
After all, shouldn't we include end users in the design process?

52
0:03:14.006,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If we're building a park to be largely used by kids,

53
0:03:17.483,000 --> 0:03:2,000
then kids should have a say in the park's design.

54
0:03:21.189,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So with all of this in mind,

55
0:03:23.101,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we formed a program called "Growing Up Boulder,"

56
0:03:25.863,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and my job is to work with children ages zero through 18

57
0:03:30.379,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to come up with innovative city-design solutions.

58
0:03:33.927,000 --> 0:03:35,000
How do we do this, you might ask?

59
0:03:35.967,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Let me give you a real example.

60
0:03:38.752,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In 2012, the city of Boulder decided to redesign a large downtown park,

61
0:03:44.855,000 --> 0:03:45,000
known as the Civic Area.

62
0:03:46.956,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This space is bounded by a farmers' market on one end,

63
0:03:50.837,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Boulder Public Library on the other end,

64
0:03:53.266,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and by Boulder Creek, which runs through the middle.

65
0:03:56.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The space needed a new design

66
0:03:58.506,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to better handle the creek's inevitable flash floods,

67
0:04:01.871,000 --> 0:04:03,000
restore a sense of safety to the area

68
0:04:04.584,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and support an expanded farmers' market.

69
0:04:07.996,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So from 2012 through 2014,

70
0:04:11.147,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we engaged more than 200 young people in the process,

71
0:04:14.649,000 --> 0:04:17,000
ranging from preschool through high school students.

72
0:04:18.093,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now, how did we do this?

73
0:04:20.347,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Let me explain.

74
0:04:21.839,000 --> 0:04:24,000
First, we visited children in their classrooms

75
0:04:24.863,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and presented the project:

76
0:04:26.879,000 --> 0:04:28,000
what it was, why their ideas mattered

77
0:04:29.855,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and what would happen with their recommendations.

78
0:04:32.807,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Before we could influence them, we asked children to record their ideas,

79
0:04:37.522,000 --> 0:04:39,000
based on their own lived experiences.

80
0:04:40.934,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Then we asked children to go on a field trip with us,

81
0:04:44.728,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to document what they liked and didn't like about the space,

82
0:04:47.855,000 --> 0:04:48,000
using photography.

83
0:04:49.99,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Through green picture frames,

84
0:04:51.887,000 --> 0:04:53,000
students highlighted what they liked about the space,

85
0:04:54.807,000 --> 0:04:56,000
such as college students, tubing down the creek.

86
0:04:57.586,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:59.72,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Then they flipped those frames over and used the red side

88
0:05:03.284,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to highlight things they didn't like, such as trash.

89
0:05:07.919,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Our sixth-grade students studied the Civic Area

90
0:05:10.934,000 --> 0:05:12,000
by researching sites with similar challenges

91
0:05:13.379,000 --> 0:05:14,000
from around the world.

92
0:05:16.03,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Then, we invited the kids to combine their original ideas

93
0:05:21.517,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with their new inspiration,

94
0:05:23.302,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to synthesize solutions to improve the space.

95
0:05:26.691,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Each class invited adult planners, city council and community members

96
0:05:31.561,000 --> 0:05:35,000
into the classroom, to share and discuss their recommendations.

97
0:05:37.307,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Boulder's senior urban planners stepped over blocks and stuffed animals

98
0:05:41.495,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to explore preschool students' full-size classroom recreation of the Civic Area.

99
0:05:48.378,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Adult planners marveled at the students' ideas

100
0:05:52.046,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as they shared a park constructed out of a jelly bracelet.

101
0:05:57.078,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was supposed to be an ice-skating rink.

102
0:05:59.871,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And then, public art constructed from animal-shaped plastic beads.

103
0:06:05.173,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And while this may seem ridiculous,

104
0:06:07.276,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it isn't so different from the models that architects create.

105
0:06:11.544,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, fast-forward four years, and I am pleased to report

106
0:06:15.069,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that many of the children's ideas are being implemented in the Civic Area.

107
0:06:20.125,000 --> 0:06:21,000
For example,

108
0:06:21.307,000 --> 0:06:23,000
there will be improved access to Boulder Creek,

109
0:06:23.903,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so kids can play safely in the water.

110
0:06:26.919,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Lighting in previously dark underpasses,

111
0:06:29.871,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so high school students can walk home safely after school at night.

112
0:06:34.588,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And separated biking and walking paths,

113
0:06:37.001,000 --> 0:06:4,000
so speeding bikers won't hit young people as they stroll by the creek.

114
0:06:42.085,000 --> 0:06:47,000
My daughter and I even skated on a new, child-requested ice-skating rink,

115
0:06:47.783,000 --> 0:06:48,000
last winter.

116
0:06:50.769,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So, were all of the kids' ideas implemented at the Civic Area?

117
0:06:55.912,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Of course not.

118
0:06:57.982,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Democracy is a messy process.

119
0:07:01.219,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But just as a reasonable and well-informed adult

120
0:07:03.911,000 --> 0:07:06,000
does not expect all of her ideas to be utilized,

121
0:07:07.038,000 --> 0:07:08,000
neither does a nine-year-old.

122
0:07:10.069,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We've now been using this process for eight years,

123
0:07:12.942,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and along the way, we've found some incredible benefits

124
0:07:15.982,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to designing cities with children.

125
0:07:18.514,000 --> 0:07:21,000
First of all, kids think differently from adults.

126
0:07:22.514,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And that's a good thing.

127
0:07:24.307,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Adults think about constraints,

128
0:07:26.45,000 --> 0:07:28,000
how much time will a project take,

129
0:07:28.568,000 --> 0:07:31,000
how much money will it cost and how dangerous will it be.

130
0:07:33.1,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In other words, "Are we going to get sued?"

131
0:07:35.957,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:37.553,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's not that these constraints aren't real,

133
0:07:39.958,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but if we kill off ideas from the beginning,

134
0:07:42.379,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it limits our creativity and dampens the design process.

135
0:07:46.861,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Kids, on the other hand, think about possibilities.

136
0:07:51.099,000 --> 0:07:53,000
For kids, the sky is the limit.

137
0:07:53.543,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Literally.

138
0:07:55.609,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When we worked with middle-school students to design teen-friendly parks,

139
0:07:59.831,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they drew pictures of skydiving, hang gliding,

140
0:08:03.411,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

141
0:08:05.244,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and jumping from trampolines into giant foam pits.

142
0:08:08.704,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:10.78,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Some of this sounds far-fetched,

144
0:08:12.899,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but the commonalities among the activities revealed an important story.

145
0:08:17.772,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Our adolescents wanted thrill-seeking opportunities.

146
0:08:21.534,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Which makes perfect sense, given their developmental stage in life.

147
0:08:25.685,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So our task, as connectors between inspiration and reality,

148
0:08:31.371,000 --> 0:08:34,000
was to point them towards activities and equipment

149
0:08:34.755,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that actually could be installed in a park.

150
0:08:38.014,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is exactly what parks in Australia have done,

151
0:08:41.061,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with their extensive zip lines and their 30-foot-tall climbing towers.

152
0:08:47.562,000 --> 0:08:49,000
When kids dream up a space,

153
0:08:49.998,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they almost always include fun, play and movement in their designs.

154
0:08:55.801,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now, this is not what adults prioritize.

155
0:09:00.007,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But research shows that fun, play and movement

156
0:09:03.063,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are exactly what adults need to stay healthy, too.

157
0:09:06.093,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:08.506,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Who wouldn't enjoy a tree house containing a little lending library

159
0:09:13.061,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and comfortable beanbag chairs for reading?

160
0:09:16.442,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Or what about a public art display

161
0:09:19.292,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that sprays paint onto a canvas each time you walk up the steps?

162
0:09:24.109,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In addition to fun and play, children value beauty in their designs.

163
0:09:29.743,000 --> 0:09:32,000
When tasked with designing dense affordable housing,

164
0:09:32.99,000 --> 0:09:35,000
kids rejected the blocks of identical, beige condominiums

165
0:09:36.649,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so many developers favor,

166
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and instead, put bright colors on everything,

167
0:09:42.741,000 --> 0:09:44,000
from housing to play equipment.

168
0:09:45.76,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They placed flowers between biking and walking paths,

169
0:09:49.363,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and placed benches along the creek,

170
0:09:51.934,000 --> 0:09:53,000
so kids could hang out with their friends

171
0:09:54.323,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and enjoy the tranquility of the water.

172
0:09:57.379,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Which leads me to nature.

173
0:09:59.173,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Children have a biological need to connect with nature,

174
0:10:02.419,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and this shows up in their designs.

175
0:10:05.046,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They want nature right in their backyards,

176
0:10:07.744,000 --> 0:10:08,000
not four blocks away.

177
0:10:09.71,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So they design communities that incorporate water,

178
0:10:12.917,000 --> 0:10:18,000
fruit trees, flowers and animals into their common spaces on site.

179
0:10:20.815,000 --> 0:10:22,000
For better or worse, this is logical,

180
0:10:23.307,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because five-year-olds today are rarely allowed to walk four blocks

181
0:10:26.883,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to access a park by themselves.

182
0:10:29.292,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And nature in one's immediate environment benefits everyone,

183
0:10:32.998,000 --> 0:10:36,000
since it has been shown to have restorative effects for all ages.

184
0:10:38.442,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It may come as a surprise,

185
0:10:40.134,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but we even take into consideration the desires or our littlest citizens,

186
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
babies and toddlers.

187
0:10:46.887,000 --> 0:10:48,000
From toddlers, we learned that the joy of walking

188
0:10:49.599,000 --> 0:10:51,000
comes from what you discover along the way.

189
0:10:53.014,000 --> 0:10:57,000
When they evaluated the walkability of Boulder's 19th Street corridor,

190
0:10:57.514,000 --> 0:11:,000
toddlers spent long stretches exploring leaves in a ditch

191
0:11:01.498,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and sparkles in the sidewalk.

192
0:11:04.839,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They reminded us to slow down

193
0:11:06.72,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and design a path where the journey is as important as the destination.

194
0:11:13.146,000 --> 0:11:15,000
In addition to trees and plants,

195
0:11:15.574,000 --> 0:11:18,000
kids almost always include animals in their designs.

196
0:11:19.117,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Insects, birds and small mammals

197
0:11:21.442,000 --> 0:11:23,000
figure prominently into children's pictures.

198
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Whether it's because they're closer to the ground

199
0:11:27.403,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and can see the grasshoppers better than we can,

200
0:11:30.553,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or simply because they have a greater sense of empathy for other beings,

201
0:11:34.814,000 --> 0:11:38,000
children almost always include non-human species in their ideal worlds.

202
0:11:40.409,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Across the board, children are inclusive in their city planning.

203
0:11:44.553,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They design for everyone, from their grandmother in a wheelchair

204
0:11:49.038,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to the homeless woman they see sleeping in the park.

205
0:11:51.988,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Children design for living creatures,

206
0:11:54.6,000 --> 0:11:57,000
not for cars, egos or corporations.

207
0:11:59.766,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The last and perhaps most compelling discovery we made

208
0:12:03.218,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is that a city friendly to children is a city friendly to all.

209
0:12:08.274,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Bogota, Colombia mayor Enrique Peñalosa

210
0:12:11.242,000 --> 0:12:14,000
observed that children are a kind of indicator species.

211
0:12:15.613,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If we can build a successful city for children,

212
0:12:18.7,000 --> 0:12:21,000
we will have a successful city for all people.

213
0:12:22.359,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Think about it.

214
0:12:23.545,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Kids can't just hop in a car and drive to the store.

215
0:12:26.95,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And most kids can't afford an expensive lunch at the nearby cafe.

216
0:12:31.196,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So if we build cities that take into the consideration

217
0:12:34.514,000 --> 0:12:36,000
their needs for alternative forms of transportation

218
0:12:36.934,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and for cheaper food venues,

219
0:12:38.855,000 --> 0:12:41,000
we meet the needs of many other populations, too.

220
0:12:42.871,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The more frequent and more affordable bus service,

221
0:12:45.768,000 --> 0:12:46,000
so desired by our youth,

222
0:12:47.752,000 --> 0:12:5,000
also supports the elderly who wish to live independently,

223
0:12:51.188,000 --> 0:12:53,000
after they can no longer drive cars.

224
0:12:54.189,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Teens' recommendations for smooth, protected walking and skateboarding paths

225
0:13:00.093,000 --> 0:13:04,000
also support the person in a wheelchair who wishes to go smoothly down the path,

226
0:13:04.928,000 --> 0:13:06,000
or the parent pushing a new stroller.

227
0:13:08.442,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So to me, all of this has revealed something important.

228
0:13:12.196,000 --> 0:13:13,000
An important blind spot.

229
0:13:14.355,000 --> 0:13:17,000
If we aren't including children in our planning,

230
0:13:17.887,000 --> 0:13:18,000
who else aren't we including?

231
0:13:20.25,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Are we listening to people of color, immigrants,

232
0:13:24.139,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the elderly and people with disabilities, or with reduced incomes?

233
0:13:29.641,000 --> 0:13:32,000
What innovative design solutions are we overlooking,

234
0:13:33.268,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because we aren't hearing the voices of the full community?

235
0:13:36.855,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We can't possibly know the needs and wants of other people

236
0:13:39.903,000 --> 0:13:4,000
without asking.

237
0:13:41.569,000 --> 0:13:43,000
That goes for kids and for everyone else.

238
0:13:44.752,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So, adults, let's stop thinking of our children as future citizens

239
0:13:49.593,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and instead, start valuing them for the citizens they are today.

240
0:13:55.59,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Because our children

241
0:13:58.034,000 --> 0:14:02,000
are designing the cities that will make us happier and healthier.

242
0:14:02.637,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Cities filled with nature, play, movement, social connection and beauty.

243
0:14:09.765,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Children are designing the cities we all want to live in.

244
0:14:14.566,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Thank you.

245
0:14:15.741,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

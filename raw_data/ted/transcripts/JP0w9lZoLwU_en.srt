1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
playing with blocks.

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
pick them up and move them around,

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you were actually learning how to think and solve problems

6
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.

7
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected

8
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to how we understand a lot of the world around us.

9
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So, as a computer scientist

10
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --

11
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
moving around a flat desktop,

15
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
arranging it the way we wanted?

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
by building Siftables.

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer

20
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the size of a cookie.

21
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They're able to be moved around by hand,

22
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and they have a screen and a wireless radio.

24
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Most importantly, they're physical,

25
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of tools for manipulating digital information.

28
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And as these tools become more physical,

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
more aware of their motion, aware of each other,

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and aware of the nuance of how we move them,

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.

32
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.

33
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This Siftable is configured to show video,

34
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;

35
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.

36
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.

37
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.

38
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If they get surrounded, they notice that too,

39
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they might get a little flustered.

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.

41
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,

42
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
was that we could use everyday gestures on data,

43
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.

44
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I can use them to pour color into that central one,

46
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where they get mixed.

47
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.

48
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There are also some neat possibilities for education,

49
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
like language, math and logic games

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,

51
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and view the results immediately.

52
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So here I'm --

53
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Applause)

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.

55
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.

56
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Basically, in every round

57
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.

59
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,

60
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.

61
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Applause)

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Thank you.

63
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Applause)

64
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,

65
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.

66
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They really loved it.

67
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application

68
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is that you don't have to give people many instructions.

69
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
All you have to say is, "Make words,"

70
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and they know exactly what to do.

71
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So here's another few people trying it out.

72
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.

74
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So to him, they were just blocks.

75
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.

76
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.

77
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And this is Felix, actually.

78
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And he can bring new characters into the scene,

79
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.

80
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Here, he's bringing the sun out.

81
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Video: The sun is rising.

82
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.

83
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Video: The orange tractor.

84
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Good job! Yeah!

85
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other

86
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
he can make the characters interact --

87
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Video: Woof!

88
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
DM: inventing his own narrative.

89
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Video: Hello!

90
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
DM: It's an open-ended story,

91
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and he gets to decide how it unfolds.

92
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Video: Fly away, cat.

93
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today

94
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is a music sequencing and live performance tool

95
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that we've built recently,

96
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in which Siftables act as sounds

97
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
like lead, bass and drums.

98
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Each of these has four different variations,

99
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you get to choose which one you want to use.

100
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence

101
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.

102
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.

103
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.

104
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.

105
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume

106
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that apply to the entire sequence.

107
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So let's have a look.

108
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Video: (Music)

109
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
DM: We'll start by putting a lead

110
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,

111
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
extend it, add a little more lead.

112
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now I put a bass line in.

113
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Video: (Music)

114
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.

115
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Video: (Music)

116
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.

117
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Video: (Music)

118
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
DM: I can speed up the whole sequence

119
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
by tilting the tempo one way or the other.

120
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Video: (Music)

121
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.

122
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Video: (Music)

123
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.

124
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,

125
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
making it longer or shorter as I go.

126
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out

127
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.

128
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Thank you.

130
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So, as you can see,

131
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces

132
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.

133
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,

134
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.

135
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So the thought I want to leave you with

136
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools

137
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for interacting with digital media

138
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that are going to bring information into our world

139
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on our terms.

140
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank you very much.

141
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I look forward to talking with all of you.

142
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

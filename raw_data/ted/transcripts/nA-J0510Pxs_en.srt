1
0:00:13.01,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Well, Arthur C. Clarke,

2
0:00:14.31,000 --> 0:00:17,000
a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s,

3
0:00:17.505,000 --> 0:00:2,000
said that, "We overestimate technology in the short term,

4
0:00:21.527,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and we underestimate it in the long term."

5
0:00:24.327,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I think that's some of the fear that we see

6
0:00:26.744,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots.

7
0:00:31.326,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That we're overestimating the technology in the short term.

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term.

9
0:00:39.371,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing

10
0:00:45.085,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that we, our society, is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.

11
0:00:50.46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.

12
0:00:53.286,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time.

13
0:00:57.925,000 --> 0:01:,000
Back in 1957, there was a Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.

14
0:01:01.877,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So you know how it ended up,

15
0:01:03.325,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Spencer Tracy brought a computer, a mainframe computer of 1957, in

16
0:01:07.411,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to help the librarians.

17
0:01:09.311,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives,

18
0:01:13.002,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"

19
0:01:16.625,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And they would look that up.

20
0:01:17.983,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job.

21
0:01:20.416,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.

22
0:01:24.326,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear.

23
0:01:27.476,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But that's not what happened in fact.

24
0:01:29.262,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957.

25
0:01:34.38,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It wasn't until the Internet came into play,

26
0:01:37.494,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the web came into play and search engines came into play

27
0:01:40.185,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that the need for librarians went down.

28
0:01:42.676,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated

29
0:01:46.883,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today.

30
0:01:51.643,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And we can just ask: "What are the names of Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly --

31
0:01:57.36,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or anything else we want to ask.

32
0:01:59.111,000 --> 0:02:04,000
By the way, the wages for librarians went up faster

33
0:02:04.71,000 --> 0:02:07,000
than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period,

34
0:02:08.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because librarians became partners of computers.

35
0:02:11.277,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Computers became tools, and they got more tools that they could use

36
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and become more effective during that time.

37
0:02:16.452,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Same thing happened in offices.

38
0:02:18.244,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Back in the old days, people used spreadsheets.

39
0:02:20.542,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,

40
0:02:22.876,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and they calculated by hand.

41
0:02:25.026,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But here was an interesting thing that came along.

42
0:02:27.431,000 --> 0:02:29,000
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,

43
0:02:29.683,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers,

44
0:02:34.425,000 --> 0:02:35,000
not to replace office workers,

45
0:02:36.077,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers.

46
0:02:40.743,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets.

47
0:02:43.871,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It increased their capabilities.

48
0:02:45.962,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They no longer had to do the mundane computations,

49
0:02:48.541,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but they could do something much more.

50
0:02:51.476,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now today, we're starting to see robots in our lives.

51
0:02:54.734,000 --> 0:02:56,000
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot.

52
0:02:57.043,000 --> 0:03:,000
When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,

53
0:03:00.475,000 --> 0:03:04,000
instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick,

54
0:03:04.624,000 --> 0:03:06,000
as they used to do up until about 2002,

55
0:03:06.943,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they now send the robot out.

56
0:03:08.351,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs.

57
0:03:10.494,000 --> 0:03:14,000
On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh.

58
0:03:15.012,000 --> 0:03:17,000
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.

59
0:03:17.417,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry.

60
0:03:20.049,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.

61
0:03:21.925,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy.

62
0:03:24.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides

63
0:03:26.955,000 --> 0:03:29,000
from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around

64
0:03:30.62,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to spend more time with patients.

65
0:03:32.693,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In fact, robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.

66
0:03:37.392,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But I think when it comes to factory robots, people are sort of afraid,

67
0:03:42.66,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because factory robots are dangerous to be around.

68
0:03:46.767,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In order to program them, you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.

69
0:03:51.592,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And ordinary people can't interact with them.

70
0:03:54.742,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong.

71
0:03:57.528,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's displaced the worker from the technology.

72
0:04:00.994,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And I think we really have to look at technologies

73
0:04:04.093,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that ordinary workers can interact with.

74
0:04:06.195,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter, which we've been talking about.

75
0:04:09.886,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And Baxter, I see, as a way -- a first wave of robot

76
0:04:14.12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting.

77
0:04:18.41,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So Baxter is up here.

78
0:04:19.943,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.

79
0:04:22.759,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We've got a conveyor there.

80
0:04:24.295,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And if the lighting isn't too extreme --

81
0:04:27.146,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Ah, ah! There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor.

82
0:04:31.192,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's going to come bring it over here and put it down.

83
0:04:34.041,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then it'll go back, reach for another object.

84
0:04:37.341,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense.

85
0:04:41.189,000 --> 0:04:43,000
By the way, what's going on with the eyes?

86
0:04:43.41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The eyes are on the screen there.

87
0:04:45.006,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.

88
0:04:47.659,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So a person that's interacting with the robot

89
0:04:49.826,000 --> 0:04:52,000
understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.

90
0:04:53.392,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Here Chris took the object out of its hand,

91
0:04:55.91,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down;

92
0:04:58.142,000 --> 0:05:,000
it went back and realized it had to get another one.

93
0:05:00.494,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's got a little bit of basic common sense, goes and picks the objects.

94
0:05:03.661,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And Baxter's safe to interact with.

95
0:05:05.454,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot.

96
0:05:08.383,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.

97
0:05:10.411,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It feels the force, understands that Chris is there

98
0:05:14.309,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and doesn't push through him and hurt him.

99
0:05:17.161,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface.

100
0:05:20.709,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now.

101
0:05:23.802,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And when he grabs an arm, it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode

102
0:05:29.216,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and graphics come up on the screen.

103
0:05:31.292,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm.

104
0:05:35.826,000 --> 0:05:38,000
He's going to put something in its hand, he's going to bring it over here,

105
0:05:39.374,000 --> 0:05:43,000
press a button and let go of that thing in the hand.

106
0:05:43.642,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And the robot figures out, ah, he must mean I want to put stuff down.

107
0:05:48.21,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It puts a little icon there.

108
0:05:49.91,000 --> 0:05:54,000
He comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together,

109
0:05:55.821,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.

110
0:05:59.743,000 --> 0:06:,000
That puts the green icon there.

111
0:06:01.542,000 --> 0:06:05,000
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.

112
0:06:06.537,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.

113
0:06:11.327,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He didn't have to select that from a menu.

114
0:06:13.351,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object

115
0:06:16.947,000 --> 0:06:17,000
while we continue talking.

116
0:06:18.515,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So as we continue here,

117
0:06:20.288,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I want to tell you about what this is like in factories.

118
0:06:22.459,000 --> 0:06:23,000
These robots we're shipping every day.

119
0:06:23.943,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They go to factories around the country.

120
0:06:25.872,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is Mildred.

121
0:06:26.675,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.

122
0:06:28.699,000 --> 0:06:3,000
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.

123
0:06:31.078,000 --> 0:06:33,000
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot,

124
0:06:33.963,000 --> 0:06:36,000
she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.

125
0:06:37.023,000 --> 0:06:39,000
She decided she really liked robots.

126
0:06:39.454,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.

127
0:06:44.124,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now she's got the robot doing it.

128
0:06:45.962,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When we first went out to talk to people in factories

129
0:06:48.526,000 --> 0:06:5,000
about how we could get robots to interact with them better,

130
0:06:51.36,000 --> 0:06:52,000
one of the questions we asked them was,

131
0:06:53.242,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Do you want your children to work in a factory?"

132
0:06:55.687,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The universal answer was "No, I want a better job than that for my children."

133
0:06:59.743,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And as a result of that, Mildred is very typical

134
0:07:03.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of today's factory workers in the U.S.

135
0:07:04.975,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They're older, and they're getting older and older.

136
0:07:07.428,000 --> 0:07:09,000
There aren't many young people coming into factory work.

137
0:07:10.119,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And as their tasks become more onerous on them,

138
0:07:13.041,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with,

139
0:07:16.134,000 --> 0:07:17,000
so that they can be part of the solution,

140
0:07:18.111,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.

141
0:07:22.795,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker

142
0:07:26.86,000 --> 0:07:28,000
becomes Mildred the robot trainer.

143
0:07:29.777,000 --> 0:07:3,000
She lifts her game,

144
0:07:30.922,000 --> 0:07:34,000
like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do.

145
0:07:35.509,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use.

146
0:07:40.057,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes.

147
0:07:43.501,000 --> 0:07:47,000
There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable.

148
0:07:47.826,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That's climate change and demographics.

149
0:07:50.203,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Demographics is really going to change our world.

150
0:07:52.87,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This is the percentage of adults who are working age.

151
0:07:56.832,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.

152
0:07:59.285,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But over the next 40 years, it's going to change dramatically, even in China.

153
0:08:03.165,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically.

154
0:08:08.002,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And turned up the other way, the people who are retirement age goes up very, very fast,

155
0:08:13.092,000 --> 0:08:17,000
as the baby boomers get to retirement age.

156
0:08:17.429,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars

157
0:08:20.977,000 --> 0:08:22,000
competing for services.

158
0:08:23.61,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But more than that, as we get older we get more frail

159
0:08:27.661,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we can't do all the tasks we used to do.

160
0:08:29.91,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers,

161
0:08:33.623,000 --> 0:08:37,000
before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older.

162
0:08:38.093,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That's happening statistically right now.

163
0:08:40.092,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And as the number of people who are older, above retirement age and getting older, as they increase,

164
0:08:46.03,000 --> 0:08:48,000
there will be less people to take care of them.

165
0:08:48.293,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us.

166
0:08:51.413,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I don't mean robots in terms of companions.

167
0:08:53.91,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves

168
0:08:57.192,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but get harder as we get older.

169
0:08:58.861,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Getting the groceries in from the car, up the stairs, into the kitchen.

170
0:09:02.266,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Or even, as we get very much older,

171
0:09:04.121,000 --> 0:09:07,000
driving our cars to go visit people.

172
0:09:07.209,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older

173
0:09:13.576,000 --> 0:09:16,000
by having control of the robotic solution.

174
0:09:17.125,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them.

175
0:09:20.721,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time

176
0:09:27.402,000 --> 0:09:29,000
with robots like Baxter

177
0:09:29.703,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will --

178
0:09:36.397,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Here, Baxter, it's good.

179
0:09:38.877,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years

180
0:09:43.121,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as part of our everyday lives.

181
0:09:45.287,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Thanks very much.

182
0:09:46.581,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

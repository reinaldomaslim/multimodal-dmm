Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED Connects.

3
0:00:15.083,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is a new series of live conversations,

4
0:00:21.667,000 --> 0:00:24,000
trying to make sense of this weird moment that we're in:

5
0:00:25.375,000 --> 0:00:26,000
coronavirus.

6
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Everyone's suddenly changing how they live their lives,

7
0:00:30.417,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it's so jolting, it's so startling.

8
0:00:33.833,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We're all trying to make sense of it, and it ain't easy.

9
0:00:37.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
That much we know.

10
0:00:38.833,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We're trying to make sense of this together

11
0:00:41.208,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the only way that we know how,

12
0:00:42.875,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which is by having wise humans coming on,

13
0:00:46.5,000 --> 0:00:48,000
talking to each other, listening to each other

14
0:00:48.708,000 --> 0:00:5,000
trying to learn from each other.

15
0:00:50.833,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We are apart,

16
0:00:52.125,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but we can use this moment to build community together,

17
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and that's what we're trying to do.

18
0:00:58.708,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So this is being produced by a virtual TED team

19
0:01:02.833,000 --> 0:01:03,000
scattered around New York,

20
0:01:04.542,000 --> 0:01:08,000
currently one of the epicenters of this pandemic.

21
0:01:08.667,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So it's definitely a scary time for people here.

22
0:01:11.417,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'd like to welcome to join me my cohost here,

23
0:01:13.792,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Whitney Pennington Rodgers.

24
0:01:16.833,000 --> 0:01:17,000
She's our current affairs curator.

25
0:01:18.833,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Whitney Pennington Rodgers: We're going to be looking a little bit

26
0:01:21.947,000 --> 0:01:22,000
at China's response today.

27
0:01:23.208,000 --> 0:01:25,000
When news surfaced about a strange viral outbreak

28
0:01:25.583,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in Wuhan, China

29
0:01:26.875,000 --> 0:01:28,000
at the very last days of 2019,

30
0:01:29.417,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I think a lot of people were confused about what was going on there,

31
0:01:33.083,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and in the months that followed,

32
0:01:35.292,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we learned more about the disease that's now known as COVID-19,

33
0:01:38.875,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we watched the situation in China quickly worsen

34
0:01:42.167,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and in the most recent weeks dramatically improve.

35
0:01:46.125,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I think as all of us around the world

36
0:01:48.167,000 --> 0:01:51,000
grapple with how we can contain and control the spread of COVID-19,

37
0:01:51.958,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there are a lot of lessons we can learn from what China experienced

38
0:01:55.25,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and how they responded.

39
0:01:56.958,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we're really thrilled to be joined today

40
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
by the CEO of the "South China Morning Post," Gary Liu,

41
0:02:02.042,000 --> 0:02:04,000
who's here to share his perspective and insights.

42
0:02:05.042,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, welcome Gary.

43
0:02:06.625,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Gary Liu: Thanks for having me.

44
0:02:08.126,000 --> 0:02:1,000
WPR: Hey there, Gary, thanks for being with us.

45
0:02:10.341,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I think before we dive into things,

46
0:02:12.333,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I'd love to hear about just how things have been

47
0:02:14.667,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for you personally,

48
0:02:15.958,000 --> 0:02:16,000
your loved ones, those close to you,

49
0:02:17.708,000 --> 0:02:18,000
how have you been experiencing this?

50
0:02:20.458,000 --> 0:02:21,000
GL: It's complicated.

51
0:02:22.125,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So we're here in Hong Kong,

52
0:02:23.875,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm working from home, like much of Hong Kong.

53
0:02:27.083,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm actually self-quarantined in our apartment here in Hong Kong,

54
0:02:30.75,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because there was a confirmed case in our workplace.

55
0:02:33.542,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So over the course of the last week plus,

56
0:02:35.75,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and likely for at least another week plus,

57
0:02:38.333,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the entire organization has been distributed

58
0:02:40.417,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and working from home.

59
0:02:42.458,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You know, when Hong Kong got its first confirmed case,

60
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I was actually back in the United States with my wife,

61
0:02:49.417,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we were taking a small break in the Rockies,

62
0:02:53.625,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and we came back to Hong Kong pretty soon after that

63
0:02:57.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to make sure we got back into Hong Kong before the airports shut.

64
0:03:01.542,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And at that point,

65
0:03:02.833,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it was all of our family in the United States and friends

66
0:03:05.583,000 --> 0:03:07,000
texting us and worrying about how things were in Hong Kong

67
0:03:08.375,000 --> 0:03:1,000
as the situation in China started escalating,

68
0:03:10.917,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and people were sending us, or trying to send us, supplies.

69
0:03:14.292,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Masks and sanitizer and stuff like that.

70
0:03:16.5,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And now it's the opposite.

71
0:03:19.042,000 --> 0:03:2,000
New York City is our home,

72
0:03:20.833,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so we certainly empathize

73
0:03:22.333,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with what you guys are dealing with right now

74
0:03:24.5,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and going through in the city.

75
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And we are seeing our friends and our family

76
0:03:29.042,000 --> 0:03:31,000
back home in New York and in California

77
0:03:31.792,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and checking in on them,

78
0:03:33.333,000 --> 0:03:35,000
trying to send equipment and materials back to them,

79
0:03:36.125,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so the script has flipped actually pretty fast

80
0:03:39.583,000 --> 0:03:41,000
over just the last couple of weeks.

81
0:03:42.167,000 --> 0:03:43,000
WPR: And you know,

82
0:03:43.458,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I think that's actually a really interesting place to start

83
0:03:46.25,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and probably a question that a lot of people who aren't in China have,

84
0:03:49.583,000 --> 0:03:51,000
you know, I think from the outside looking in,

85
0:03:51.75,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it seems as if what's happened in China

86
0:03:54.292,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is kind of miraculous.

87
0:03:55.625,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That to go from, you know,

88
0:03:57.458,000 --> 0:04:,000
you have a country with more than a billion people there,

89
0:04:00.917,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to go from as many as 80,000 cases to nearly zero new cases now,

90
0:04:07.625,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you know, what can you tell us about how this happened,

91
0:04:10.75,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to help us understand the current situation

92
0:04:13.625,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and just really how China ended up there?

93
0:04:17.542,000 --> 0:04:18,000
GL: Yeah, a lot has happened.

94
0:04:18.958,000 --> 0:04:2,000
China has been dealing with this for several months now.

95
0:04:21.625,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Several-month head start, that's not a good thing,

96
0:04:24.042,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but they have gone through several different phases.

97
0:04:26.875,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I think, Whitney, before I jump into it,

98
0:04:28.829,000 --> 0:04:31,000
there are a couple of caveats that are really important to make.

99
0:04:31.842,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The first one is that we're still parsing what happened in China.

100
0:04:35.167,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The information system, as everyone knows,

101
0:04:38.042,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is still relatively closed.

102
0:04:39.625,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so a lot of the information that we're using

103
0:04:42.542,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to piece together what happened in China is still not fully complete.

104
0:04:46.708,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And so with every passing day, every passing week,

105
0:04:49.083,000 --> 0:04:5,000
there's more information

106
0:04:50.375,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that allows us to retroactively make sure that we get the picture

107
0:04:53.458,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of what happened early on in those early days

108
0:04:55.708,000 --> 0:04:56,000
at the end of 2019,

109
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
get that picture right.

110
0:04:59.208,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And there's still a lot that's happening today,

111
0:05:01.458,000 --> 0:05:03,000
even though I think the information sharing

112
0:05:03.5,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is much more open than it was early on,

113
0:05:06.375,000 --> 0:05:08,000
there's still a lot of stuff that we need to parse.

114
0:05:08.792,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And the second important caveat here

115
0:05:10.542,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is that I think learning sometimes suggests

116
0:05:12.625,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that everything China did was right and good,

117
0:05:14.875,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and hopefully, other countries can take it and apply it,

118
0:05:18.542,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but that's not 100 percent the case.

119
0:05:20.5,000 --> 0:05:22,000
China, of course, did a lot that was right,

120
0:05:22.583,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and if we walked through the time line,

121
0:05:24.5,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I think it would be pretty apparent

122
0:05:26.208,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the decisions that they made kept the coronavirus

123
0:05:29.875,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from really exploding across the entire country

124
0:05:32.458,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and really limited it to one province and mostly one city.

125
0:05:37.083,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But there were also many, many missteps,

126
0:05:39.292,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and those are things that I think the world can also learn from,

127
0:05:42.458,000 --> 0:05:44,000
most importantly, China should learn from,

128
0:05:44.542,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because most of these --

129
0:05:46.667,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I think those of us who are professional observers

130
0:05:49.083,000 --> 0:05:5,000
would call missteps,

131
0:05:50.375,000 --> 0:05:52,000
are because they are systemic issues with the country,

132
0:05:53.375,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because of governance, lack of free information flow,

133
0:05:55.917,000 --> 0:05:56,000
stuff like that.

134
0:05:57.208,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Those are the initial caveats,

135
0:05:58.833,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but I think the timing of how China progressed

136
0:06:01.875,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from first case to now has been fascinating.

137
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:08,000
WPR: Yeah, and I mean,

138
0:06:08.583,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so we know now that in Hubei province

139
0:06:11.042,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they've officially lifted the two-month lockdown.

140
0:06:15.042,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And are you getting the sense,

141
0:06:16.542,000 --> 0:06:2,000
do you feel like this is the right decision to make at this moment?

142
0:06:22.875,000 --> 0:06:23,000
GL: I don't think I'm the right person

143
0:06:24.833,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to say whether or not it's the right decision.

144
0:06:27.042,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But certainly, this has been a progression of decisions,

145
0:06:32.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I think they've been sitting on this decision for quite some time.

146
0:06:35.583,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Wuhan itself, which was where the pandemic started,

147
0:06:40.083,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it was the first epicenter and the major epicenter.

148
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Wuhan is opening up on April 8,

149
0:06:45.5,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that's right now the schedule.

150
0:06:47.292,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And this is really, what we're in now is the third of three phases

151
0:06:50.708,000 --> 0:06:52,000
from the first discovery of the virus in Wuhan.

152
0:06:53.5,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now, April 8 will be about 11 weeks

153
0:06:56.292,000 --> 0:06:58,000
after Wuhan the city got completely shut down,

154
0:06:59.083,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the Hubei province got shut down.

155
0:07:01.458,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And so for those who are in a shelter, at home

156
0:07:05.625,000 --> 0:07:08,000
kind of situations right now in the United States

157
0:07:08.958,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and wondering how long this is going to take,

158
0:07:11.333,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in Wuhan, they've been locked down for 11 weeks

159
0:07:15.792,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and only now has the Chinese government decided

160
0:07:18.667,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they're ready to start letting people move freely around.

161
0:07:22.833,000 --> 0:07:23,000
WPR: And to your point earlier

162
0:07:24.292,000 --> 0:07:27,000
about some of the possible missteps in terms of reporting,

163
0:07:27.875,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I mean, there are still reports now

164
0:07:29.625,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that we might not be getting an accurate number of cases

165
0:07:33.792,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that we're seeing in Wuhan or beyond,

166
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we're hearing some people say there are no new cases,

167
0:07:38.542,000 --> 0:07:41,000
other people saying that there actually are cases.

168
0:07:41.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So do you feel like there is accurate spread of information

169
0:07:45.583,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about the current state of the virus in China right now?

170
0:07:50.625,000 --> 0:07:51,000
GL: Generally, yes,

171
0:07:51.917,000 --> 0:07:55,000
with the caveat that it is based on the Chinese government's definition.

172
0:07:55.958,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And this is one of the problems right now

173
0:07:57.958,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that even the World Health Organization is struggling with,

174
0:08:00.75,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is that the definition of what is a confirmed case,

175
0:08:03.167,000 --> 0:08:04,000
what is an infection,

176
0:08:04.458,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is different from country to country.

177
0:08:06.292,000 --> 0:08:07,000
As an example, in China,

178
0:08:08.042,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the folks that have tested positive but are asymptomatic,

179
0:08:11.958,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we understand now that they are not included,

180
0:08:14.083,000 --> 0:08:15,000
since February 7,

181
0:08:15.375,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they have not been included in the official numbers.

182
0:08:17.875,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Or at the very least, on February 7, they changed that definition,

183
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and they're not included in those official numbers.

184
0:08:23.458,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And that could be another 50 percent

185
0:08:25.542,000 --> 0:08:27,000
on top of the numbers that we're seeing today.

186
0:08:27.75,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So what we've found,

187
0:08:29.417,000 --> 0:08:33,000
our reporters have gotten their hands on some classified government documents

188
0:08:33.792,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and government data

189
0:08:35.083,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that suggests that a third of total actual positive tests are asymptomatic,

190
0:08:41.542,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and therefore not included in official numbers.

191
0:08:43.792,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, I don't think that this is an example

192
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of the Chinese government trying to hide information.

193
0:08:48.626,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is a definitions issue,

194
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:51,000
which countries have been debating

195
0:08:51.708,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and people are doing it in different ways.

196
0:08:54.375,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But like I said,

197
0:08:55.667,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there really have been three very distinct phases.

198
0:08:58.667,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We are in the third phase

199
0:09:00.292,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that I would call recovery and rehabilitation,

200
0:09:03.375,000 --> 0:09:06,000
rehabilitation being the rehabilitation of China's image.

201
0:09:06.833,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But the first part was discovery and a lot of denial.

202
0:09:10.667,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And then there was this two-and-a-half-month period

203
0:09:13.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of response and containment.

204
0:09:15.75,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And that I think, the response and containment part

205
0:09:18.208,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is the most interesting to the rest of the world.

206
0:09:21.208,000 --> 0:09:23,000
WPR: And so maybe we can break some of that down,

207
0:09:23.518,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you know, thinking about China's response.

208
0:09:25.792,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What were some of the specific things

209
0:09:27.917,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that you think China did right,

210
0:09:30.125,000 --> 0:09:33,000
both as a nation, individuals in the country,

211
0:09:33.625,000 --> 0:09:36,000
what were some of the things that you saw that worked really well?

212
0:09:37.125,000 --> 0:09:39,000
GL: OK, so let me walk through the time line,

213
0:09:39.708,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I want to try and get these dates right, because the dates do matter,

214
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I think again, for context,

215
0:09:44.333,000 --> 0:09:46,000
how many weeks it took from one step to another.

216
0:09:47.125,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Let me actually back up into that initial first phase,

217
0:09:49.673,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that discovery and denial phase.

218
0:09:51.708,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The first time we heard about the coronavirus,

219
0:09:55.75,000 --> 0:09:59,000
this mysterious respiratory disease that looks somewhat like SARS,

220
0:10:00.542,000 --> 0:10:01,000
was on December 30.

221
0:10:02.125,000 --> 0:10:04,000
That was the day that there was a doctor,

222
0:10:04.167,000 --> 0:10:06,000
whose name is known all over the world

223
0:10:06.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for the unfortunate reason

224
0:10:07.917,000 --> 0:10:09,000
he ended up eventually dying,

225
0:10:10.083,000 --> 0:10:11,000
named Li Wenliang.

226
0:10:11.875,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And Li Wenliang, Dr. Li,

227
0:10:13.417,000 --> 0:10:15,000
posted to a private WeChat group on December 30.

228
0:10:16.167,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These were some of his old classmates from med school.

229
0:10:18.75,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And he said, "Hey, I'm in Wuhan, I'm at the hospital,

230
0:10:22.167,000 --> 0:10:24,000
there is a SARS-like illness,"

231
0:10:24.458,000 --> 0:10:27,000
SARS being the epidemic from 2002 to 2003,

232
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
"There's a SARS-like illness

233
0:10:29.75,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that is spreading through these hospitals in Wuhan."

234
0:10:33.125,000 --> 0:10:34,000
A private message.

235
0:10:34.417,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Somebody forwarded it,

236
0:10:35.708,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and it went viral across the Chinese internet.

237
0:10:38.208,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The very next --

238
0:10:39.5,000 --> 0:10:41,000
so that was the first time we actually heard about something

239
0:10:42.417,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that was going on in Wuhan.

240
0:10:43.792,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The very next day, December 31,

241
0:10:45.375,000 --> 0:10:47,000
was the first time that any Chinese officials --

242
0:10:47.75,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and on that day,

243
0:10:49.042,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it happened to be the actual provincial and the city officials --

244
0:10:52.208,000 --> 0:10:54,000
acknowledged that there were 27 people,

245
0:10:54.75,000 --> 0:10:55,000
at that moment in time,

246
0:10:56.042,000 --> 0:10:59,000
who had been diagnosed with this mysterious pneumonia,

247
0:10:59.958,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and they reported the cases to the World Health Organization.

248
0:11:03.25,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That was also the day that Dr. Li was reprimanded,

249
0:11:05.667,000 --> 0:11:06,000
officially reprimanded.

250
0:11:07.458,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So that was really the discovery,

251
0:11:09.125,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the end of the discovery and denial phase,

252
0:11:11.917,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because what we know now

253
0:11:13.917,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is that back to mid-December,

254
0:11:16.958,000 --> 0:11:19,000
several weeks before Dr. Li wrote his blog post,

255
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the authorities had already been notified

256
0:11:22.042,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that a SARS-like pneumonia was showing up in Wuhan hospitals.

257
0:11:25.833,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And action had already started down the chain of authority.

258
0:11:30.167,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They have now backdated, at least publicly backdated,

259
0:11:33.167,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the first case to December 1.

260
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But actually, in their confidential and classified government documents

261
0:11:40.75,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that again, our journalists have seen,

262
0:11:42.625,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and we've published a story --

263
0:11:45.083,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Officially, in classified documents,

264
0:11:47.208,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they've backdated the first COVID-19 case all the way back to November 17,

265
0:11:52.542,000 --> 0:11:54,000
as the earliest example that they can find

266
0:11:54.583,000 --> 0:11:56,000
based on symptoms and based on retroactive diagnosis

267
0:11:57.458,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for a COVID-19 case.

268
0:11:59.5,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So in effect, there were several weeks

269
0:12:01.667,000 --> 0:12:03,000
before the acknowledgment to the World Health Organization

270
0:12:04.458,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that that was going on,

271
0:12:05.833,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and the first case with symptoms

272
0:12:07.5,000 --> 0:12:09,000
was actually identified about a month and a half

273
0:12:09.763,000 --> 0:12:12,000
before that notice to the World Health Organization.

274
0:12:13.042,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Then the second phase,

275
0:12:14.333,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which really started, let's say, December 31,

276
0:12:16.5,000 --> 0:12:17,000
when the acknowledgment happened,

277
0:12:18.125,000 --> 0:12:2,000
was response and then massive containment.

278
0:12:20.333,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now this phase, to be clear, still had some denial

279
0:12:23.125,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and a good amount of censorship happening within the country.

280
0:12:26.625,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So on January 1,

281
0:12:27.917,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the World Health Organization started working with China

282
0:12:30.583,000 --> 0:12:33,000
on trying to identify the virus and trying to figure out course of action.

283
0:12:34.125,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It wasn't until several weeks later

284
0:12:36.583,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that Beijing, the central government, for the first time broke its silence,

285
0:12:40.167,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and that was on January 18.

286
0:12:42.792,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And actually, they broke the silence to deny that this was SARS,

287
0:12:46.208,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and in fact to "defy rumors"

288
0:12:49.083,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that were spreading around the Chinese internet.

289
0:12:52.083,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But there was a major date that happened two days afterwards,

290
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which was January 20.

291
0:12:56.958,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Because for the first time,

292
0:12:58.458,000 --> 0:13:,000
a member of the party,

293
0:13:00.625,000 --> 0:13:04,000
a senior government official who is now one of the central gentlemen

294
0:13:04.875,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that is actually leading the task force against COVID-19,

295
0:13:08.792,000 --> 0:13:11,000
his name is Zhong Nanshan, he's an epidemiologist,

296
0:13:11.917,000 --> 0:13:14,000
he was one of the central figures during SARS 17 years ago.

297
0:13:14.958,000 --> 0:13:16,000
On January 20, he visited Wuhan.

298
0:13:17.667,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And he admitted, for the first time,

299
0:13:20.083,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that human-to-human transmission was possible.

300
0:13:22.417,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now this was important,

301
0:13:23.708,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because prior to that, officials who had spoken up

302
0:13:26.5,000 --> 0:13:29,000
had said that human-to-human transmission was not likely,

303
0:13:30.417,000 --> 0:13:31,000
was not possible.

304
0:13:32.208,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And previous to that,

305
0:13:33.5,000 --> 0:13:35,000
all of the cases, the majority of the cases

306
0:13:36.083,000 --> 0:13:4,000
were tied to this seafood and wildlife marketplace

307
0:13:40.5,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that was in the city of Wuhan.

308
0:13:42.792,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But now, on January 20,

309
0:13:44.458,000 --> 0:13:47,000
human-to-human transmission, it's possible, it's happening,

310
0:13:48.208,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and so of course, the course of action,

311
0:13:50.125,000 --> 0:13:51,000
not only in China,

312
0:13:51.417,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but the course of action all over the world,

313
0:13:53.542,000 --> 0:13:54,000
started to change.

314
0:13:54.875,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And three days after that, Wuhan was locked down.

315
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
It was completely, I mean, it shocked the world

316
0:14:00.792,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that they could lock down that many people so quickly.

317
0:14:03.375,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Of course, now India yesterday announced

318
0:14:05.333,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that 1.3 billion people are being locked down.

319
0:14:07.708,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So we have another frame of reference now.

320
0:14:11.083,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And then the end of this middle second phase

321
0:14:14.625,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I think really came in March, around March 10.

322
0:14:17.792,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Actually, on March 10 I should say,

323
0:14:19.5,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan.

324
0:14:23.667,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And these things, in Chinese politics,

325
0:14:25.917,000 --> 0:14:27,000
because everything is so well-choreographed,

326
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:29,000
matters a whole lot.

327
0:14:29.292,000 --> 0:14:3,000
The fact that Xi Jinping visited Wuhan

328
0:14:31.126,000 --> 0:14:35,000
signaled that the Chinese government believed the worst was over.

329
0:14:35.25,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The reality was that probably about 20 days before that,

330
0:14:40.25,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the curve had already been flattened.

331
0:14:42.708,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So 20 days before that, probably around February 20,

332
0:14:46.708,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the infection rate was around 75,000, 76,000,

333
0:14:50.625,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and it's effectively stayed within a couple of thousand since then.

334
0:14:54.458,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So on March 10,

335
0:14:56.167,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan kind of signaled the worst is over,

336
0:14:59.292,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and then they moved into the recovery and rehabilitation phase.

337
0:15:04.25,000 --> 0:15:05,000
WPR: OK.

338
0:15:05.542,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I mean, if I'm hearing correctly -- thank you for sharing all of that,

339
0:15:08.875,000 --> 0:15:12,000
it sounds like, although there was a slow period

340
0:15:13.083,000 --> 0:15:15,000
of getting the information out initially,

341
0:15:15.125,000 --> 0:15:19,000
eventually there was quick reaction from the Chinese government

342
0:15:19.667,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to respond to this, lock folks down.

343
0:15:22.833,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And it seems like that had a real impact on flattening the curve

344
0:15:26.833,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in China, in Wuhan.

345
0:15:28.125,000 --> 0:15:29,000
GL: A real impact.

346
0:15:29.417,000 --> 0:15:3,000
WPR: Yeah and I --

347
0:15:30.708,000 --> 0:15:31,000
GL: Absolutely.

348
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
WPR: Yes, please go ahead, Gary.

349
0:15:33.583,000 --> 0:15:36,000
GL: The date of January 23 was not by coincidence.

350
0:15:37.167,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Because the Chinese New Year holiday started on January 24,

351
0:15:41.833,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the very next day.

352
0:15:43.25,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And the thing is,

353
0:15:44.667,000 --> 0:15:45,000
with the Chinese New Year holiday,

354
0:15:46.333,000 --> 0:15:49,000
is that it is, every single year, it's the largest human migration

355
0:15:49.583,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that happens on Earth.

356
0:15:50.875,000 --> 0:15:52,000
About 400 million people travel

357
0:15:53.667,000 --> 0:15:57,000
during about a forty-day period that would have started on January 24.

358
0:15:58.625,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And that's three billion trips,

359
0:16:00.333,000 --> 0:16:02,000
it's just people traveling all over the country,

360
0:16:02.625,000 --> 0:16:03,000
400 million people traveling.

361
0:16:05.542,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Now, Wuhan is one of the most important cities in China,

362
0:16:09.542,000 --> 0:16:1,000
although before this,

363
0:16:10.833,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I don't think a lot of people around the world knew the city of Wuhan,

364
0:16:15.083,000 --> 0:16:16,000
but it's extremely important.

365
0:16:16.75,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It is considered the most important city in the center of China

366
0:16:20.25,000 --> 0:16:21,000
for many different reasons,

367
0:16:21.583,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but one of the key reasons

368
0:16:22.875,000 --> 0:16:25,000
is that it is one of the key transportation hubs of the country.

369
0:16:26.375,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So all of the major train lines,

370
0:16:27.958,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the high-speed train lines, the normal train lines,

371
0:16:30.413,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the trade lines,

372
0:16:31.625,000 --> 0:16:32,000
they all kind of converge on Wuhan.

373
0:16:33.542,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So you can imagine if 400 million people start moving around

374
0:16:37.333,000 --> 0:16:39,000
for Chinese New Year on January 24,

375
0:16:39.542,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a huge number of them were going to go through Wuhan.

376
0:16:42.083,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And of course, Wuhan itself is an 11-million-person city.

377
0:16:44.875,000 --> 0:16:46,000
The surrounding cities all added together,

378
0:16:46.917,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Hubei province has about 60 million people,

379
0:16:49.083,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and they were also largely going to travel.

380
0:16:51.958,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And so if January 23 they had not shut it down,

381
0:16:54.583,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and people had started traveling,

382
0:16:56.458,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the likelihood would have been

383
0:16:58.25,000 --> 0:17:,000
that this would have been really, really hard,

384
0:17:00.917,000 --> 0:17:03,000
possibly, likely impossible to contain.

385
0:17:04.708,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And even though they shut down before the Chinese New Year holiday started,

386
0:17:08.292,000 --> 0:17:11,000
we now also know that at least five million people actually left

387
0:17:11.917,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the surrounding areas and traveled.

388
0:17:14.375,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Which is one of the reasons why it did spread a little bit

389
0:17:17.25,000 --> 0:17:18,000
across the country,

390
0:17:18.542,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and then eventually spread to other parts of the world.

391
0:17:21.333,000 --> 0:17:23,000
WPR: And I'd like to come back to that as well,

392
0:17:23.583,000 --> 0:17:25,000
just thinking about the five million people who left

393
0:17:26.042,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and sort of where they landed today and how that affected things,

394
0:17:29.167,000 --> 0:17:3,000
but before we do that,

395
0:17:30.458,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I'm interested to talk with you a little bit more about --

396
0:17:33.292,000 --> 0:17:36,000
you mentioned this November date as one of the earliest cases

397
0:17:36.5,000 --> 0:17:38,000
you discovered that was reported was in November,

398
0:17:39.458,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and that's something actually that I hadn't heard before,

399
0:17:42.5,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and I imagine that might be news to a lot of people hearing this,

400
0:17:46.792,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and so I'm curious,

401
0:17:48.083,000 --> 0:17:5,000
when you think about the missteps from China's perspective,

402
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:52,000
in terms of what China did,

403
0:17:52.625,000 --> 0:17:54,000
you know, there is, as you mentioned,

404
0:17:54.708,000 --> 0:17:56,000
suppression of information is one thing,

405
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:,000
one major criticism of how China handled this.

406
0:18:00.125,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And hearing that maybe there was knowledge of something as early as November,

407
0:18:04.458,000 --> 0:18:05,000
if that might have played a role

408
0:18:06.006,000 --> 0:18:09,000
in how we were able to control and contain this a lot sooner.

409
0:18:10.375,000 --> 0:18:11,000
GL: I do want to clarify,

410
0:18:11.667,000 --> 0:18:12,000
from what we understand,

411
0:18:13.083,000 --> 0:18:15,000
officials were not notified about this until mid-December.

412
0:18:15.833,000 --> 0:18:16,000
It wasn't --

413
0:18:17.208,000 --> 0:18:19,000
So it was really a couple of weeks

414
0:18:19.833,000 --> 0:18:23,000
between officials realizing that there was a SARS-like pneumonia

415
0:18:24.542,000 --> 0:18:25,000
going around

416
0:18:25.833,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to when the first case was reported to the World Health Organization.

417
0:18:29.133,000 --> 0:18:31,000
It wasn't all the way back to November 17.

418
0:18:31.172,000 --> 0:18:32,000
That was retroactively backdated,

419
0:18:32.823,000 --> 0:18:34,000
but that has not been made public by the government.

420
0:18:35.323,000 --> 0:18:37,000
We published it because we've seen the data

421
0:18:37.378,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that actually backdates the first case.

422
0:18:40.292,000 --> 0:18:41,000
From a misstep point of view,

423
0:18:41.75,000 --> 0:18:44,000
again, it's a couple of weeks compared to what happened in SARS,

424
0:18:44.792,000 --> 0:18:47,000
which was a long time of locking down on information.

425
0:18:48.667,000 --> 0:18:49,000
This was much shorter,

426
0:18:50.333,000 --> 0:18:55,000
the period of time that the government wasn't in complete shutdown mode.

427
0:18:55.667,000 --> 0:18:56,000
But then, after that, of course,

428
0:18:57.25,000 --> 0:18:59,000
there was still continued censorship on the internet,

429
0:18:59.917,000 --> 0:19:01,000
especially within the Great Firewall of China,

430
0:19:02.542,000 --> 0:19:04,000
for communications between Chinese citizens.

431
0:19:05.042,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And you know, surprisingly to some,

432
0:19:07.667,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I think for a lot of China watchers not so surprisingly,

433
0:19:10.311,000 --> 0:19:12,000
is that the government has -- the central government --

434
0:19:13.25,000 --> 0:19:15,000
over the course of the last several weeks,

435
0:19:15.5,000 --> 0:19:17,000
actually, I should say probably the last two months,

436
0:19:18.417,000 --> 0:19:19,000
has started to change their tone

437
0:19:20.292,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and to some degree admit

438
0:19:22.458,000 --> 0:19:25,000
that there needed to be better free flow of information.

439
0:19:25.75,000 --> 0:19:28,000
They've changed the official narrative of a couple of different things,

440
0:19:29.125,000 --> 0:19:31,000
including this initial whistleblower, Dr. Li,

441
0:19:31.667,000 --> 0:19:35,000
who unfortunately ended up passing away from the virus,

442
0:19:35.792,000 --> 0:19:39,000
they actually now refer to him as a national hero,

443
0:19:40.375,000 --> 0:19:43,000
they have officially removed the reprimand,

444
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
the Wuhan police have apologized to Dr. Li's family,

445
0:19:48.667,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and they have actually been --

446
0:19:50.167,000 --> 0:19:54,000
a couple of policemen -- have been punished in Wuhan

447
0:19:54.333,000 --> 0:19:56,000
for the way that they handled the situation.

448
0:19:56.417,000 --> 0:19:59,000
So there has definitely been an internal shift

449
0:19:59.708,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and there is a lot more sharing of data and information.

450
0:20:02.958,000 --> 0:20:03,000
I can tell you,

451
0:20:04.25,000 --> 0:20:06,000
from Hong Kong's point of view,

452
0:20:06.292,000 --> 0:20:09,000
without the open sharing of information between the authorities,

453
0:20:10.042,000 --> 0:20:11,000
between Hong Kong and mainland China,

454
0:20:11.833,000 --> 0:20:14,000
I think Hong Kong's response would have been much more different

455
0:20:15.375,000 --> 0:20:17,000
and I think Hong Kong would have suffered because of that.

456
0:20:18.125,000 --> 0:20:2,000
So that much more open sharing of information

457
0:20:20.583,000 --> 0:20:22,000
has benefited this city for sure.

458
0:20:23.75,000 --> 0:20:25,000
WPR: And we have Chris here who has a question,

459
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
I think, from the audience.

460
0:20:28.083,000 --> 0:20:29,000
CA: Hey, Gary.

461
0:20:29.375,000 --> 0:20:31,000
The online audience, loving what you're saying.

462
0:20:32.375,000 --> 0:20:33,000
It's so interesting,

463
0:20:33.667,000 --> 0:20:35,000
you're giving us amazing new insights here.

464
0:20:37.125,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Just in the current situation

465
0:20:39.083,000 --> 0:20:42,000
where much of --

466
0:20:42.375,000 --> 0:20:45,000
you know, there have been these very few reports of new cases.

467
0:20:45.833,000 --> 0:20:48,000
How much does it feel like life is getting back to normal?

468
0:20:49.792,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Do people really believe that this problem has been successfully tackled elsewhere?

469
0:20:57.375,000 --> 0:20:59,000
GL: I think the sentiment in mainland China

470
0:20:59.458,000 --> 0:21:02,000
is that yes, in China, the problem has been tackled.

471
0:21:03.458,000 --> 0:21:06,000
And people are looking forward to going back to normal life.

472
0:21:07.083,000 --> 0:21:09,000
A lot of the other major cities, Shanghai, Beijing,

473
0:21:09.667,000 --> 0:21:1,000
are starting to get back to work.

474
0:21:11.5,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Many of the factories have now been reopened.

475
0:21:13.833,000 --> 0:21:14,000
The last stat that I saw

476
0:21:15.25,000 --> 0:21:18,000
was that 90 percent of the businesses that had been shut down

477
0:21:18.75,000 --> 0:21:19,000
are now reopened in China.

478
0:21:20.583,000 --> 0:21:22,000
So generally speaking, life is getting back to normal.

479
0:21:23.417,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Wuhan and Hubei are really the last places that are still shut down,

480
0:21:26.875,000 --> 0:21:29,000
with Wuhan being the city that is shut down until April 8.

481
0:21:30.167,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Hong Kong is a little bit different.

482
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:33,000
Hong Kong has actually gone back

483
0:21:33.583,000 --> 0:21:36,000
into a second wave of social isolation and distancing.

484
0:21:37.333,000 --> 0:21:39,000
A bunch of different companies, us included,

485
0:21:39.917,000 --> 0:21:42,000
as well as the Hong Kong government and the civil service

486
0:21:43.167,000 --> 0:21:45,000
has now gone back to work from home.

487
0:21:45.542,000 --> 0:21:48,000
And it's because we are starting to see a second wave,

488
0:21:49.042,000 --> 0:21:54,000
but for us, honestly, is the first time that we've had a spike of infections,

489
0:21:54.333,000 --> 0:21:55,000
and it's because of imported cases.

490
0:21:56.083,000 --> 0:21:58,000
It's because a lot of Hong Kong residents

491
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:01,000
who left Hong Kong prior to,

492
0:22:01.958,000 --> 0:22:04,000
well, actually when the virus first came into the city,

493
0:22:05.708,000 --> 0:22:07,000
are now returning, because oddly enough,

494
0:22:08.125,000 --> 0:22:12,000
the places they escaped to are now more dangerous than Hong Kong.

495
0:22:12.333,000 --> 0:22:14,000
And as they're coming back,

496
0:22:14.417,000 --> 0:22:17,000
a lot of them are actually bringing the virus back with them.

497
0:22:17.708,000 --> 0:22:19,000
And so we're starting to see a spike.

498
0:22:19.75,000 --> 0:22:22,000
Before this week, the highest infection day that Hong Kong had

499
0:22:23.542,000 --> 0:22:24,000
during the first two months of this

500
0:22:25.292,000 --> 0:22:28,000
was 10 infections in one day.

501
0:22:28.333,000 --> 0:22:3,000
Now the highest that we've seen in the last week was 48.

502
0:22:31.125,000 --> 0:22:33,000
So this is really the first spike that we're seeing,

503
0:22:33.708,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and so Hong Kong is returning back to a state of alertness,

504
0:22:37.417,000 --> 0:22:38,000
to a state of caution,

505
0:22:38.75,000 --> 0:22:4,000
and more and more people are holed up at home.

506
0:22:42.167,000 --> 0:22:44,000
CA: Is it possible, in mainland China,

507
0:22:44.583,000 --> 0:22:47,000
that because of this redefinition that you spoke about,

508
0:22:47.667,000 --> 0:22:5,000
where if someone tests positive, but they're not showing symptoms,

509
0:22:51.25,000 --> 0:22:52,000
that is not reported as a case.

510
0:22:53.083,000 --> 0:22:55,000
That seems significant to me.

511
0:22:56.042,000 --> 0:22:57,000
Is that part of the explanation

512
0:22:58.042,000 --> 0:23:02,000
for why new reports have gone nearly to zero?

513
0:23:04.958,000 --> 0:23:07,000
GL: I don't know if that's the answer to it,

514
0:23:08.083,000 --> 0:23:11,000
but I do actually think that even with --

515
0:23:11.125,000 --> 0:23:13,000
and remember, these are folks that are tested,

516
0:23:13.833,000 --> 0:23:16,000
so the data that we have is that these folks have been tested,

517
0:23:17.792,000 --> 0:23:18,000
the tests have come back positive,

518
0:23:19.458,000 --> 0:23:21,000
but have not been added to the official number of infections,

519
0:23:22.375,000 --> 0:23:23,000
because they're asymptomatic.

520
0:23:23.833,000 --> 0:23:25,000
But they have still gone through the process

521
0:23:26.167,000 --> 0:23:28,000
that is part of China's containment strategy,

522
0:23:28.667,000 --> 0:23:31,000
which has worked extraordinarily well.

523
0:23:31.708,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Which is, first of all, lots and lots of people have been tested.

524
0:23:34.917,000 --> 0:23:35,000
And then once --

525
0:23:36.208,000 --> 0:23:37,000
if there is a positive test return,

526
0:23:37.917,000 --> 0:23:4,000
regardless of whether or not they're symptomatic or asymptomatic,

527
0:23:41,000 --> 0:23:43,000
regardless of whether or not they're added to official numbers,

528
0:23:43.977,000 --> 0:23:45,000
what happens next is that they are quarantined,

529
0:23:46.208,000 --> 0:23:47,000
they're isolated,

530
0:23:47.5,000 --> 0:23:49,000
and contact tracing happens.

531
0:23:49.792,000 --> 0:23:51,000
Contact tracing is a key, key, key action.

532
0:23:52.583,000 --> 0:23:55,000
And so they go and figure out where this person has been moving,

533
0:23:56.042,000 --> 0:23:57,000
where they've been,

534
0:23:57.708,000 --> 0:23:58,000
who they've been in contact with,

535
0:23:59.333,000 --> 0:24:02,000
and all those folks that they've been in close contact with,

536
0:24:02.5,000 --> 0:24:03,000
they get tested.

537
0:24:03.792,000 --> 0:24:06,000
And if they come back with a positive test,

538
0:24:07.583,000 --> 0:24:1,000
then they're also isolated and they go through the process again.

539
0:24:10.667,000 --> 0:24:12,000
So China has not been testing people,

540
0:24:13.333,000 --> 0:24:15,000
finding that they're asymptomatic and then just releasing them

541
0:24:16.292,000 --> 0:24:17,000
and letting them go home.

542
0:24:17.625,000 --> 0:24:18,000
That's not the case.

543
0:24:19,000 --> 0:24:21,000
WPR: I think to that point too, Gary, what you mentioned

544
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:26,000
about this trace-testing and being able to figure out

545
0:24:26.375,000 --> 0:24:27,000
who people have been in contact with

546
0:24:28.125,000 --> 0:24:3,000
to figure out who may also have been infected,

547
0:24:30.917,000 --> 0:24:32,000
you know, when you look at what's happening

548
0:24:32.958,000 --> 0:24:33,000
in other parts of the world,

549
0:24:34.333,000 --> 0:24:37,000
you hear in the United States, where Chris and I are based right now,

550
0:24:37.667,000 --> 0:24:4,000
you're hearing that people who are experiencing symptoms,

551
0:24:41.292,000 --> 0:24:43,000
have symptoms cannot get tested.

552
0:24:43.333,000 --> 0:24:46,000
You know, how does China's ability to test so many people

553
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:51,000
affect the way that they can respond to this and control this virus?

554
0:24:51.917,000 --> 0:24:52,000
GL: It really matters.

555
0:24:53.333,000 --> 0:24:55,000
Without the significant testing

556
0:24:55.458,000 --> 0:24:57,000
and without the contact tracing that comes afterwards,

557
0:24:58.292,000 --> 0:25:,000
I don't think there's a way that China could have contained it

558
0:25:01.292,000 --> 0:25:02,000
the way that they did.

559
0:25:02.583,000 --> 0:25:03,000
The same thing here in Hong Kong.

560
0:25:04.458,000 --> 0:25:05,000
If we didn't have both of those,

561
0:25:06.042,000 --> 0:25:08,000
as minimum requirements in a health system,

562
0:25:08.792,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Hong Kong could not have contained it.

563
0:25:10.626,000 --> 0:25:12,000
And this is actually the reason why

564
0:25:13.542,000 --> 0:25:15,000
South Korea is the only other country besides China

565
0:25:16.458,000 --> 0:25:17,000
that has managed to flatten the curve,

566
0:25:18.333,000 --> 0:25:19,000
is because they aggressively tested.

567
0:25:20.25,000 --> 0:25:22,000
I think by far the highest per capita testing

568
0:25:22.833,000 --> 0:25:24,000
anywhere in the world, as far as we know right now.

569
0:25:25.5,000 --> 0:25:27,000
And they aggressively did contact tracing.

570
0:25:27.708,000 --> 0:25:3,000
And because of that, even though South Korea had this huge spike,

571
0:25:31.208,000 --> 0:25:33,000
and we thought that it was going to get out of hand,

572
0:25:33.75,000 --> 0:25:35,000
they were able to suppress it, control it,

573
0:25:35.792,000 --> 0:25:37,000
and now they're in a much, much better place.

574
0:25:38.708,000 --> 0:25:41,000
WPR: One thing you mentioned earlier that I'd love to talk about, too, is SARS

575
0:25:42.458,000 --> 0:25:47,000
and the impact of going through that in 2002 and 2003 for China,

576
0:25:47.75,000 --> 0:25:49,000
other countries in Asia, Hong Kong.

577
0:25:50.5,000 --> 0:25:54,000
You know, what effect did that have on everyone's preparedness

578
0:25:54.542,000 --> 0:25:55,000
in that part of the world

579
0:25:56.125,000 --> 0:25:58,000
for the COVID-19 outbreak?

580
0:25:59.375,000 --> 0:26:,000
GL: It was significant.

581
0:26:00.667,000 --> 0:26:02,000
I think the institutional and social memory of SARS

582
0:26:03.208,000 --> 0:26:04,000
matters a heck of a lot,

583
0:26:05.042,000 --> 0:26:08,000
when you look at China, Hong Kong, South Korea,

584
0:26:08.25,000 --> 0:26:09,000
Singapore, Taiwan, Japan,

585
0:26:09.542,000 --> 0:26:13,000
a lot of these countries in Asia have dealt with COVID-19.

586
0:26:13.667,000 --> 0:26:14,000
Let me use Hong Kong as an example,

587
0:26:15.375,000 --> 0:26:17,000
because it's the one that I know the most intimately.

588
0:26:17.876,000 --> 0:26:18,000
But a lot of what I'm about to say

589
0:26:19.583,000 --> 0:26:22,000
actually does apply to those other areas of Asia.

590
0:26:22.75,000 --> 0:26:23,000
So for context,

591
0:26:24.167,000 --> 0:26:27,000
SARS, November 2002 to July 2003,

592
0:26:27.333,000 --> 0:26:3,000
very, very similar coronavirus to COVID-19,

593
0:26:31.167,000 --> 0:26:36,000
I think there's about an 80 percent similarity to those two viruses.

594
0:26:36.542,000 --> 0:26:39,000
The global infected number was a little over 8,000,

595
0:26:40.042,000 --> 0:26:42,000
774 deaths.

596
0:26:42.292,000 --> 0:26:43,000
So by percentage,

597
0:26:43.958,000 --> 0:26:45,000
deadlier than COVID-19 is

598
0:26:46.333,000 --> 0:26:49,000
but far less infectious than COVID-19 is.

599
0:26:49.375,000 --> 0:26:51,000
Now here's why it impacted Hong Kong so much,

600
0:26:51.875,000 --> 0:26:54,000
and why the memory is so deep,

601
0:26:55.125,000 --> 0:26:59,000
and actually it tells you a lot about Hong Kong's reaction to COVID-19.

602
0:26:59.25,000 --> 0:27:,000
Of the 8,000 infected,

603
0:27:00.833,000 --> 0:27:04,000
22 percent were here in the city of 7.5 million,

604
0:27:05,000 --> 0:27:08,000
and 40 percent, actually 39 percent of the deaths,

605
0:27:08.125,000 --> 0:27:1,000
299 people died in Hong Kong.

606
0:27:11,000 --> 0:27:14,000
Thirty-nine percent of the global deaths happened in Hong Kong.

607
0:27:14.083,000 --> 0:27:15,000
And SARS did not start in Hong Kong,

608
0:27:15.958,000 --> 0:27:17,000
it was imported into Hong Kong

609
0:27:18.083,000 --> 0:27:19,000
from southern China.

610
0:27:19.75,000 --> 0:27:21,000
And so SARS, again, deep, deep memory,

611
0:27:22.25,000 --> 0:27:25,000
but it was a massive turning point in the Hong Kong health care system

612
0:27:25.708,000 --> 0:27:27,000
and also the social practices of the city.

613
0:27:29.667,000 --> 0:27:31,000
And let me walk through some of that impact,

614
0:27:32.167,000 --> 0:27:33,000
because you can actually still see it,

615
0:27:34.042,000 --> 0:27:36,000
even before COVID-19, you see it every day.

616
0:27:36.5,000 --> 0:27:37,000
The health care system

617
0:27:38.458,000 --> 0:27:43,000
was able to really, very quickly, ramp up in capacity,

618
0:27:43.5,000 --> 0:27:46,000
because of preparation post-SARS.

619
0:27:46.625,000 --> 0:27:47,000
So after SARS,

620
0:27:48.583,000 --> 0:27:51,000
the Hong Kong health care authorities started preparing for greater capacity,

621
0:27:52.25,000 --> 0:27:53,000
especially for infectious diseases.

622
0:27:53.958,000 --> 0:27:54,000
There were new health alert systems,

623
0:27:55.75,000 --> 0:27:57,000
warnings and treatment protocols put in place.

624
0:27:58.167,000 --> 0:28:01,000
I can tell you that a lot of folks that were here before SARS

625
0:28:02.083,000 --> 0:28:04,000
will tell you that in Hong Kong hospitals,

626
0:28:04.583,000 --> 0:28:05,000
before SARS,

627
0:28:05.875,000 --> 0:28:06,000
it was actually rare to see

628
0:28:07.25,000 --> 0:28:09,000
even medical professionals wear face masks.

629
0:28:09.458,000 --> 0:28:11,000
And now surgical masks are ubiquitous,

630
0:28:12.458,000 --> 0:28:15,000
not only in hospitals, but across the entire city.

631
0:28:15.5,000 --> 0:28:17,000
Anytime, anywhere, it seems, especially right now.

632
0:28:19,000 --> 0:28:21,000
New channels of communication and data

633
0:28:21.208,000 --> 0:28:24,000
and information exchange were opened up with mainland Chinese authorities,

634
0:28:24.792,000 --> 0:28:25,000
and technology was implemented,

635
0:28:26.375,000 --> 0:28:3,000
including now a supercomputer that actually does contact tracing

636
0:28:31.292,000 --> 0:28:32,000
in Hong Kong.

637
0:28:32.583,000 --> 0:28:34,000
You could trace the existence of the supercomputer

638
0:28:34.958,000 --> 0:28:38,000
and this contact-tracing ability back to changes that happened post-SARS.

639
0:28:39.75,000 --> 0:28:4,000
On the social side,

640
0:28:41.292,000 --> 0:28:43,000
there was also a huge change.

641
0:28:43.417,000 --> 0:28:46,000
The first thing I have to talk about is, of course, masks.

642
0:28:47.208,000 --> 0:28:5,000
Now, I know that there is still not consensus everywhere in the world

643
0:28:51.167,000 --> 0:28:54,000
about whether or not masks actually help in this situation.

644
0:28:54.292,000 --> 0:28:55,000
I know that the World Health Organization

645
0:28:56.269,000 --> 0:28:58,000
as well as governments like the US, as well as Singapore,

646
0:28:59.125,000 --> 0:29:01,000
say that only medical personnel

647
0:29:01.542,000 --> 0:29:03,000
as well as people who are actually sick and showing symptoms

648
0:29:04.376,000 --> 0:29:05,000
need to be wearing masks.

649
0:29:05.667,000 --> 0:29:08,000
In Hong Kong, everyone wears masks.

650
0:29:08.792,000 --> 0:29:09,000
And the government,

651
0:29:10.083,000 --> 0:29:12,000
even though they flip-flopped a little bit

652
0:29:12.125,000 --> 0:29:14,000
during this epidemic,

653
0:29:14.167,000 --> 0:29:15,000
the general,

654
0:29:15.625,000 --> 0:29:18,000
the guidance is that everyone should be wearing masks.

655
0:29:18.958,000 --> 0:29:19,000
That started in SARS.

656
0:29:20.917,000 --> 0:29:23,000
Ninety percent of Hong Kongers during SARS wore masks,

657
0:29:24.167,000 --> 0:29:27,000
and that habit actually stayed with Hong Kongers,

658
0:29:27.583,000 --> 0:29:3,000
and so generally speaking, even outside of the pandemic,

659
0:29:30.708,000 --> 0:29:31,000
when people are sick and coughing,

660
0:29:32.667,000 --> 0:29:34,000
you'll see them wear masks out in public.

661
0:29:35.375,000 --> 0:29:36,000
On top of that,

662
0:29:36.667,000 --> 0:29:38,000
there was -- it became systemic,

663
0:29:38.792,000 --> 0:29:39,000
or I should say systematic controls

664
0:29:40.75,000 --> 0:29:43,000
for hygiene in social and public spaces.

665
0:29:43.917,000 --> 0:29:44,000
So if you visit Hong Kong,

666
0:29:45.875,000 --> 0:29:46,000
again, before all of this happened,

667
0:29:47.708,000 --> 0:29:51,000
you would have noticed that public spaces are constantly being disinfected.

668
0:29:52.042,000 --> 0:29:53,000
One good example that everyone notices

669
0:29:53.917,000 --> 0:29:56,000
is that when you go into an elevator in public spaces, in buildings,

670
0:29:57.542,000 --> 0:29:58,000
they will either have one of two things,

671
0:29:59.5,000 --> 0:30:,000
potentially both.

672
0:30:00.792,000 --> 0:30:01,000
They'll either have a sign that tells you

673
0:30:02.792,000 --> 0:30:04,000
how often the elevator buttons are disinfected,

674
0:30:05.042,000 --> 0:30:07,000
or there will be a plastic,

675
0:30:07.167,000 --> 0:30:11,000
piece of sticky plastic, like a plastic sheet over the buttons

676
0:30:11.625,000 --> 0:30:14,000
so it effectively becomes a flat surface.

677
0:30:15.125,000 --> 0:30:16,000
When you eat out,

678
0:30:16.458,000 --> 0:30:18,000
Hong Kong is obviously famous for its dim sum,

679
0:30:19,000 --> 0:30:21,000
and one of the most famous things about Hong Kong dim sum

680
0:30:21.691,000 --> 0:30:22,000
are the dim sum carts,

681
0:30:22.958,000 --> 0:30:26,000
which are also very popular in New York's Chinatown, as an example.

682
0:30:27,000 --> 0:30:29,000
Those dim sum carts,

683
0:30:29.458,000 --> 0:30:31,000
they pretty much went away after SARS.

684
0:30:32.083,000 --> 0:30:35,000
And so most dim sum restaurants that you'll go to in Hong Kong now,

685
0:30:35.25,000 --> 0:30:37,000
the vast majority of them, you have to order off of a menu,

686
0:30:38.083,000 --> 0:30:41,000
you don't have public carts going around because of hygiene issues.

687
0:30:41.75,000 --> 0:30:43,000
In most nice Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong now

688
0:30:44.542,000 --> 0:30:45,000
you will get, when you sit down,

689
0:30:46.5,000 --> 0:30:47,000
two pairs of chopsticks per person.

690
0:30:48.5,000 --> 0:30:5,000
And those two pairs of chopsticks are different colored,

691
0:30:51.208,000 --> 0:30:53,000
because one is used to grab food from the center of the table

692
0:30:54.083,000 --> 0:30:54,000
to your plate,

693
0:30:54.877,000 --> 0:30:57,000
and the other one is for you to take the food and put it in your mouth.

694
0:30:58.208,000 --> 0:30:59,000
And honestly, there are hand sanitizers

695
0:31:00.167,000 --> 0:31:02,000
and hand-washing notices literally everywhere,

696
0:31:02.375,000 --> 0:31:05,000
and this is just part of the social behavior after SARS.

697
0:31:05.458,000 --> 0:31:06,000
Safety protocols in offices,

698
0:31:07.042,000 --> 0:31:08,000
everyone knows how to shut down an office

699
0:31:09.042,000 --> 0:31:11,000
and control traffic really well.

700
0:31:11.125,000 --> 0:31:13,000
Most major offices have temperature-check machines

701
0:31:13.583,000 --> 0:31:14,000
at the very least available,

702
0:31:15.542,000 --> 0:31:16,000
and then, of course, social distancing.

703
0:31:17.424,000 --> 0:31:2,000
People understand social distancing is important,

704
0:31:20.792,000 --> 0:31:24,000
and so the moment there was fear of what was happening across the border,

705
0:31:25.125,000 --> 0:31:28,000
naturally, people started social-distancing activities

706
0:31:28.417,000 --> 0:31:31,000
and self-quarantine became pretty normal.

707
0:31:31.833,000 --> 0:31:33,000
So those are all the social things

708
0:31:33.917,000 --> 0:31:36,000
as well as the health system things that kind of changed,

709
0:31:37.625,000 --> 0:31:38,000
and because of that,

710
0:31:39.458,000 --> 0:31:41,000
Hong Kong was able to react really, really fast,

711
0:31:41.833,000 --> 0:31:43,000
not just the government, not just the health authorities

712
0:31:44.542,000 --> 0:31:45,000
but the people of Hong Kong,

713
0:31:45.917,000 --> 0:31:47,000
and I think that's the most important part,

714
0:31:47.958,000 --> 0:31:5,000
is that the entire city, that the community reacted

715
0:31:51.042,000 --> 0:31:53,000
and went into this mode where you wore masks,

716
0:31:53.417,000 --> 0:31:55,000
you washed your hands, you carried hand sanitizer,

717
0:31:55.792,000 --> 0:31:56,000
you stopped going to public places.

718
0:31:57.5,000 --> 0:31:58,000
WPR: I'm curious then,

719
0:31:58.833,000 --> 0:32:,000
I think a lot of people who are listening at home

720
0:32:01.208,000 --> 0:32:03,000
and figuring out how can we apply some of those things here,

721
0:32:04.125,000 --> 0:32:05,000
and from where you sit,

722
0:32:05.417,000 --> 0:32:07,000
and when you see what's going on in other parts of the world,

723
0:32:08.299,000 --> 0:32:11,000
where maybe people are struggling to make some of these changes.

724
0:32:12.125,000 --> 0:32:14,000
You know, what are some of the specific things

725
0:32:14.333,000 --> 0:32:16,000
you think folks can adapt in their own cultures,

726
0:32:17.125,000 --> 0:32:18,000
in their own countries?

727
0:32:19.958,000 --> 0:32:21,000
GL: I think communication is a huge deal.

728
0:32:22.542,000 --> 0:32:23,000
If you talk to local Hong Kongers,

729
0:32:24.208,000 --> 0:32:27,000
they will likely opine that the communication

730
0:32:27.25,000 --> 0:32:29,000
from the Hong Kong government has not been top notch.

731
0:32:29.875,000 --> 0:32:31,000
But thankfully, there have been other authorities

732
0:32:32.208,000 --> 0:32:34,000
and certainly even just person-to-person communication

733
0:32:34.756,000 --> 0:32:35,000
has been pretty strong.

734
0:32:36.042,000 --> 0:32:38,000
A lot of corporates have done an incredible job in Hong Kong

735
0:32:38.876,000 --> 0:32:4,000
in communicating very transparently

736
0:32:41.375,000 --> 0:32:42,000
with their employees

737
0:32:43,000 --> 0:32:46,000
and insurance companies have also been making available

738
0:32:46.458,000 --> 0:32:5,000
all sorts of webinars and materials

739
0:32:50.792,000 --> 0:32:51,000
and made it actually quite easy

740
0:32:52.542,000 --> 0:32:54,000
for people to understand how to get tested,

741
0:32:54.625,000 --> 0:32:56,000
where to get tested, who to get tested.

742
0:32:56.833,000 --> 0:32:57,000
And so that communication, I think,

743
0:32:58.833,000 --> 0:33:,000
has centralized, to some degree, the messaging.

744
0:33:01.5,000 --> 0:33:02,000
In a city like Hong Kong,

745
0:33:02.792,000 --> 0:33:04,000
everyone generally believes the same thing,

746
0:33:05.458,000 --> 0:33:07,000
and what they believe is generally true.

747
0:33:07.625,000 --> 0:33:09,000
Of course, there's still misinformation issues,

748
0:33:09.84,000 --> 0:33:1,000
as there are everywhere.

749
0:33:11.375,000 --> 0:33:14,000
But I think, possibly also because of SARS,

750
0:33:14.542,000 --> 0:33:16,000
because over the course of the 17 years,

751
0:33:16.792,000 --> 0:33:18,000
a lot of the misinformation has now been vetted,

752
0:33:19.083,000 --> 0:33:2,000
everyone knows what is true,

753
0:33:20.5,000 --> 0:33:23,000
so there is already, sort of, an internal radar

754
0:33:24,000 --> 0:33:27,000
or at least alarm bell for things that seem to be wrong.

755
0:33:28.458,000 --> 0:33:3,000
So I think communication is really important,

756
0:33:31.125,000 --> 0:33:34,000
from government, from corporates anywhere in the world.

757
0:33:34.417,000 --> 0:33:38,000
And I think if there is a recommendation for health systems,

758
0:33:38.583,000 --> 0:33:4,000
I know getting tests is really difficult.

759
0:33:40.792,000 --> 0:33:43,000
One of the things that has made testing in China and Hong Kong

760
0:33:44.25,000 --> 0:33:46,000
certainly so effective, is that there is point-of-care testing,

761
0:33:47.25,000 --> 0:33:48,000
that still really doesn't exist,

762
0:33:48.958,000 --> 0:33:5,000
or at least doesn't exist in volume in the US.

763
0:33:51.542,000 --> 0:33:53,000
And so they have to save these tests

764
0:33:53.667,000 --> 0:33:55,000
and only a certain number of people can get tested,

765
0:33:56.292,000 --> 0:33:59,000
the triage system then becomes overflowing.

766
0:33:59.542,000 --> 0:34:,000
Whereas here, generally speaking,

767
0:34:01.208,000 --> 0:34:02,000
everyone can get tested,

768
0:34:02.5,000 --> 0:34:03,000
and then of course, the contact tracing.

769
0:34:04.458,000 --> 0:34:07,000
Everyone knows that if somebody that you've been in contact with

770
0:34:08.042,000 --> 0:34:09,000
tests positive,

771
0:34:09.333,000 --> 0:34:11,000
you're going to be called in by the hospital authorities

772
0:34:12,000 --> 0:34:13,000
and you're going to be tested,

773
0:34:13.5,000 --> 0:34:14,000
and then if you're positive,

774
0:34:14.875,000 --> 0:34:16,000
everyone you've been in contact with for the last two weeks

775
0:34:17.708,000 --> 0:34:18,000
will also be called in.

776
0:34:19,000 --> 0:34:21,000
And people don't really see it as an annoyance,

777
0:34:21.5,000 --> 0:34:22,000
it's just what needs to be done.

778
0:34:23.292,000 --> 0:34:24,000
And I think because of that, again,

779
0:34:25.083,000 --> 0:34:26,000
the containment has been effective.

780
0:34:27.833,000 --> 0:34:29,000
WPR: Great. And we have a question from Chris here.

781
0:34:30.292,000 --> 0:34:33,000
CA: Gary, it actually builds on the point you just made,

782
0:34:33.375,000 --> 0:34:34,000
people are puzzled online,

783
0:34:34.708,000 --> 0:34:39,000
how is it that China avoided the explosion of cases

784
0:34:39.958,000 --> 0:34:42,000
in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai,

785
0:34:43.542,000 --> 0:34:45,000
where people were coming there from Wuhan.

786
0:34:46.333,000 --> 0:34:49,000
How on earth did some of those cases not explode?

787
0:34:49.625,000 --> 0:34:52,000
Was it just down to really diligent contact tracing?

788
0:34:53.875,000 --> 0:34:55,000
GL: I think it was a combination of things.

789
0:34:55.917,000 --> 0:34:59,000
First of all, the shutdown of Hubei province certainly helped.

790
0:35:00.083,000 --> 0:35:03,000
And then, the major cities actually went into isolation

791
0:35:03.292,000 --> 0:35:04,000
and quarantine as well.

792
0:35:05.792,000 --> 0:35:09,000
Remember, it was Chinese New Year, so there was no one working that week.

793
0:35:09.833,000 --> 0:35:1,000
And so everyone just went home.

794
0:35:11.625,000 --> 0:35:13,000
And generally speaking, in most major cities,

795
0:35:13.792,000 --> 0:35:15,000
they locked their doors and they didn't leave.

796
0:35:16,000 --> 0:35:17,000
Now, China is very prepared for this,

797
0:35:17.917,000 --> 0:35:18,000
because the technology stack in China,

798
0:35:19.792,000 --> 0:35:21,000
including consumer site services,

799
0:35:22.042,000 --> 0:35:24,000
make it really easy to lock your doors

800
0:35:24.083,000 --> 0:35:25,000
and get everything delivered to you.

801
0:35:25.833,000 --> 0:35:27,000
This is infrastructure and this is consumer behavior

802
0:35:28.375,000 --> 0:35:29,000
that is already ingrained,

803
0:35:29.792,000 --> 0:35:3,000
especially in major cities across China.

804
0:35:31.75,000 --> 0:35:33,000
So people just went home.

805
0:35:34.083,000 --> 0:35:35,000
There was also a stigma issue,

806
0:35:36.083,000 --> 0:35:38,000
which is unfortunate for people from Hubei,

807
0:35:38.25,000 --> 0:35:39,000
and especially from Wuhan.

808
0:35:40.167,000 --> 0:35:43,000
But there are plenty of stories in the other major Chinese cities

809
0:35:43.458,000 --> 0:35:46,000
where anyone coming from Hubei or with any connection to Wuhan

810
0:35:47.25,000 --> 0:35:49,000
were ostracized during those early days,

811
0:35:5,000 --> 0:35:52,000
especially after the Wuhan lockdown.

812
0:35:52.417,000 --> 0:35:57,000
And so folks that might have been, in fact, carrying the virus,

813
0:35:57.583,000 --> 0:35:58,000
because they were from the epicenter,

814
0:35:59.5,000 --> 0:36:01,000
they were either self-quarantined,

815
0:36:01.667,000 --> 0:36:02,000
or they were forcibly quarantined,

816
0:36:03.375,000 --> 0:36:05,000
because no one was going to spend time with them anyway.

817
0:36:06.019,000 --> 0:36:07,000
So I think for a lot of those reasons,

818
0:36:07.875,000 --> 0:36:09,000
some of them social, some of them systemic,

819
0:36:10.875,000 --> 0:36:15,000
they made it so that there was much less person-to-person contact,

820
0:36:16,000 --> 0:36:18,000
especially after the authorities admitted

821
0:36:18.083,000 --> 0:36:2,000
that human-to-human transmission was possible.

822
0:36:21.5,000 --> 0:36:23,000
CA: Hospitals here in New York,

823
0:36:23.792,000 --> 0:36:25,000
there are warnings that they're about to get overwhelmed.

824
0:36:27.542,000 --> 0:36:29,000
What can we learn from what happened in Wuhan,

825
0:36:29.958,000 --> 0:36:31,000
some of the scenes from there were horrifying,

826
0:36:32.625,000 --> 0:36:34,000
but there were amazing stories as well.

827
0:36:34.75,000 --> 0:36:37,000
What should we learn from what happened there?

828
0:36:38.625,000 --> 0:36:39,000
GL: Well, it started off horrifying.

829
0:36:40.417,000 --> 0:36:43,000
So in the early days, post-lockdown,

830
0:36:43.833,000 --> 0:36:44,000
all the stories coming out of Wuhan,

831
0:36:45.625,000 --> 0:36:48,000
we had journalists that were there right before the lockdown,

832
0:36:48.917,000 --> 0:36:5,000
they got out about three hours before the lockdown happened,

833
0:36:51.792,000 --> 0:36:53,000
and we had people what ended up having to be quarantined,

834
0:36:54.5,000 --> 0:36:55,000
because they were stuck in Hubei.

835
0:36:56.333,000 --> 0:36:59,000
As well as a lot of citizen journalists that were documenting what was going on,

836
0:37:00.167,000 --> 0:37:02,000
and those images, like you said, Chris, were horrifying.

837
0:37:02.833,000 --> 0:37:05,000
There were videos showing people literally laying on the ground.

838
0:37:06.833,000 --> 0:37:08,000
Some were just so sick they couldn't move,

839
0:37:08.875,000 --> 0:37:09,000
others had already died

840
0:37:10.167,000 --> 0:37:12,000
and they were just covered with plastic sheets.

841
0:37:12.417,000 --> 0:37:14,000
There were nurses and doctors that were just crying

842
0:37:14.875,000 --> 0:37:15,000
in front of the camera, begging for help.

843
0:37:16.875,000 --> 0:37:18,000
And so, I think it's important to understand

844
0:37:19,000 --> 0:37:22,000
that China's health care system did not just immediately become effective.

845
0:37:22.542,000 --> 0:37:23,000
And certainly not in Wuhan.

846
0:37:23.958,000 --> 0:37:24,000
There was not that much information,

847
0:37:25.75,000 --> 0:37:27,000
people didn't know what they were dealing with.

848
0:37:28,000 --> 0:37:31,000
Certainly, the authorities were trying to help,

849
0:37:31.083,000 --> 0:37:32,000
I think at that moment,

850
0:37:32.417,000 --> 0:37:35,000
but again, the information flow was not that free.

851
0:37:35.792,000 --> 0:37:37,000
And during lockdown,

852
0:37:37.875,000 --> 0:37:39,000
people were screaming off of their balconies,

853
0:37:40.042,000 --> 0:37:42,000
because they couldn't get food,

854
0:37:43,000 --> 0:37:45,000
they couldn't even go to the hospital,

855
0:37:45.083,000 --> 0:37:48,000
because the public transportation systems got locked down.

856
0:37:48.5,000 --> 0:37:49,000
Remember, this is not,

857
0:37:49.792,000 --> 0:37:5,000
Wuhan is not a city like New York

858
0:37:51.583,000 --> 0:37:53,000
where most of New York is walkable.

859
0:37:54.583,000 --> 0:37:56,000
For people who don't have cars,

860
0:37:56.75,000 --> 0:37:58,000
and many, many of the Wuhan residents don't have cars,

861
0:37:59.583,000 --> 0:38:,000
if the buses are locked down,

862
0:38:01.375,000 --> 0:38:05,000
then they might have to walk three, four hours, to get to a hospital.

863
0:38:05.667,000 --> 0:38:06,000
Maybe not that long,

864
0:38:06.958,000 --> 0:38:08,000
but they have to walk a long way to get to a hospital.

865
0:38:09.542,000 --> 0:38:11,000
And so a lot of people were just stuck at home,

866
0:38:11.792,000 --> 0:38:15,000
and they were unable to initially get any diagnosis or any health care.

867
0:38:16.125,000 --> 0:38:17,000
And so it was a disaster.

868
0:38:17.833,000 --> 0:38:19,000
But then the capacity actually ramped up.

869
0:38:20.833,000 --> 0:38:23,000
The triage system became extremely effective.

870
0:38:24.583,000 --> 0:38:27,000
I think most people have heard now that there were two massive hospitals

871
0:38:28.042,000 --> 0:38:3,000
with thousands of beds of capacity

872
0:38:30.25,000 --> 0:38:32,000
that were built within 10 days.

873
0:38:33.042,000 --> 0:38:34,000
And this is true,

874
0:38:34.417,000 --> 0:38:35,000
they came out of nowhere,

875
0:38:35.958,000 --> 0:38:38,000
they were literally just parking lots or flat ground,

876
0:38:39.125,000 --> 0:38:42,000
and two major hospital units were built up.

877
0:38:42.833,000 --> 0:38:45,000
To be clear, also, those were the triage units

878
0:38:46.625,000 --> 0:38:49,000
for those who have very mild symptoms.

879
0:38:50.5,000 --> 0:38:51,000
But that's really important.

880
0:38:52.333,000 --> 0:38:54,000
Being able to get people with mild symptoms

881
0:38:54.375,000 --> 0:38:56,000
out of the major hospital systems,

882
0:38:56.417,000 --> 0:38:59,000
so that they're not taking up the resources of nurses and doctors,

883
0:38:59.833,000 --> 0:39:01,000
they are not taking up the diagnostic equipment

884
0:39:02.083,000 --> 0:39:03,000
for the second confirmation tests,

885
0:39:04.083,000 --> 0:39:07,000
and also, especially, they are not taking up isolation wards

886
0:39:07.583,000 --> 0:39:08,000
and ventilators.

887
0:39:09.125,000 --> 0:39:12,000
And so the moment people started being moved out, the mild symptoms,

888
0:39:12.625,000 --> 0:39:13,000
the ones that were going to survive

889
0:39:14.333,000 --> 0:39:16,000
and they just really needed to be separate from family

890
0:39:17.333,000 --> 0:39:19,000
and have some antiviral medication,

891
0:39:20.25,000 --> 0:39:22,000
once they were moved out into these new hospitals,

892
0:39:22.958,000 --> 0:39:24,000
the main hospitals in Wuhan and across Hubei

893
0:39:25.833,000 --> 0:39:27,000
could deal with the primary patients,

894
0:39:28.083,000 --> 0:39:29,000
especially those that are critical,

895
0:39:29.792,000 --> 0:39:32,000
of the overall tested population and do their best and try and save them

896
0:39:33.292,000 --> 0:39:36,000
and make sure that they're not highly infectious.

897
0:39:36.875,000 --> 0:39:38,000
At the same time, I think that the health authorities in China,

898
0:39:39.875,000 --> 0:39:4,000
especially the nurses and the doctors,

899
0:39:41.75,000 --> 0:39:43,000
did a very good job of also protecting themselves.

900
0:39:44.167,000 --> 0:39:47,000
So there have been far fewer, by percentage, infections and deaths,

901
0:39:47.334,000 --> 0:39:49,000
of medical staff than there were during SARS.

902
0:39:50.208,000 --> 0:39:52,000
CA: I mean, to respond that effectively

903
0:39:52.667,000 --> 0:39:56,000
took a kind of top-down drive.

904
0:39:56.875,000 --> 0:40:,000
Plus a willingness of a lot of people to risk their own well-being

905
0:40:01.75,000 --> 0:40:03,000
in a way for their perception of what they had to do

906
0:40:04.208,000 --> 0:40:05,000
for the public good.

907
0:40:05.5,000 --> 0:40:08,000
You are well aware of the cultural differences between China, Hong Kong

908
0:40:09.333,000 --> 0:40:1,000
and the West.

909
0:40:11.167,000 --> 0:40:14,000
Do you -- how do you rate the chances

910
0:40:14.333,000 --> 0:40:18,000
of, say, the US responding effectively

911
0:40:18.625,000 --> 0:40:19,000
should things really explode here,

912
0:40:20.333,000 --> 0:40:22,000
as they seem like they may be about to?

913
0:40:24.333,000 --> 0:40:25,000
GL: In the health care system side,

914
0:40:26.042,000 --> 0:40:29,000
I have every confidence that the US health care system

915
0:40:29.083,000 --> 0:40:3,000
is going to be able to respond well.

916
0:40:30.958,000 --> 0:40:31,000
I have many, many friends

917
0:40:32.667,000 --> 0:40:34,000
who are medical professionals in the United States,

918
0:40:35.25,000 --> 0:40:37,000
and they are raising their hands and volunteering

919
0:40:38.25,000 --> 0:40:41,000
and going to hospitals to see where they can help.

920
0:40:41.417,000 --> 0:40:42,000
So I have full trust in the system,

921
0:40:43.125,000 --> 0:40:45,000
and the people that man those systems.

922
0:40:45.458,000 --> 0:40:47,000
Our health care capacity in the United States

923
0:40:47.583,000 --> 0:40:5,000
is also significantly greater, doctors per capita,

924
0:40:50.875,000 --> 0:40:51,000
than in China.

925
0:40:52.375,000 --> 0:40:54,000
And because of the fact that also, our health care system

926
0:40:55.208,000 --> 0:40:56,000
is not just relying on hospitals,

927
0:40:57.042,000 --> 0:41:,000
but there are primary care physicians scattered all over the country,

928
0:41:00.305,000 --> 0:41:03,000
as long as the testing capacity and testing kits are available

929
0:41:03.667,000 --> 0:41:05,000
across the country,

930
0:41:06.208,000 --> 0:41:08,000
general practitioners can actually administer those.

931
0:41:08.667,000 --> 0:41:12,000
And it certainly sounds like more and more med tech start-ups in the US

932
0:41:12.917,000 --> 0:41:14,000
are now trying to create these home kits,

933
0:41:15.208,000 --> 0:41:16,000
so that people can start testing at home.

934
0:41:17.208,000 --> 0:41:18,000
That will help a lot.

935
0:41:18.583,000 --> 0:41:23,000
My hope is certainly that the citizens of the US,

936
0:41:23.792,000 --> 0:41:25,000
that people are going to take this very, very seriously

937
0:41:26.458,000 --> 0:41:28,000
and realize that it doesn't matter that you may not feel sick,

938
0:41:29.417,000 --> 0:41:31,000
it doesn't matter if you think you are young

939
0:41:31.5,000 --> 0:41:34,000
and that you are not prone to catching this virus,

940
0:41:35.208,000 --> 0:41:37,000
or that you're not in --

941
0:41:37.5,000 --> 0:41:41,000
you may not be fearful of dire consequences and death.

942
0:41:42.458,000 --> 0:41:45,000
Take it seriously and stay home.

943
0:41:45.75,000 --> 0:41:46,000
And don't go to public spaces,

944
0:41:47.542,000 --> 0:41:48,000
and don't be a carrier,

945
0:41:49.333,000 --> 0:41:52,000
because we now know that asymptomatic folks can be carriers

946
0:41:52.708,000 --> 0:41:55,000
and there is a possibility that you can be infectious

947
0:41:56.042,000 --> 0:41:59,000
as an asymptomatic carrier.

948
0:41:59.292,000 --> 0:42:01,000
So yeah, on the cultural side --

949
0:42:01.833,000 --> 0:42:03,000
I don't think it's really cultural.

950
0:42:04.042,000 --> 0:42:05,000
I would say that

951
0:42:05.333,000 --> 0:42:07,000
it's because of the impact of SARS,

952
0:42:07.458,000 --> 0:42:09,000
it's because of the social memory of SARS

953
0:42:10.417,000 --> 0:42:12,000
that has meant people are a little bit more selfless,

954
0:42:13.167,000 --> 0:42:15,000
and have just said, "OK, I will stay home,

955
0:42:15.208,000 --> 0:42:17,000
because I might have come in contact."

956
0:42:17.792,000 --> 0:42:18,000
CA: Yeah, weirdly,

957
0:42:19.083,000 --> 0:42:21,000
SARS seems to have acted as its own kind of vaccine,

958
0:42:21.583,000 --> 0:42:24,000
sort of just prepped the system enough for people to be ready.

959
0:42:25.167,000 --> 0:42:26,000
Yeah, social vaccine, amazing.

960
0:42:26.792,000 --> 0:42:27,000
Back to you, Whitney.

961
0:42:28.083,000 --> 0:42:29,000
WPR: OK, great, thanks so much, Chris.

962
0:42:29.958,000 --> 0:42:31,000
And so I think it's interesting, Gary, to hear you talk

963
0:42:32.554,000 --> 0:42:34,000
about some of the reactions in Wuhan

964
0:42:35.542,000 --> 0:42:37,000
and some of the stories that you've heard,

965
0:42:38.042,000 --> 0:42:4,000
especially running the "South China Morning Post"

966
0:42:40.375,000 --> 0:42:44,000
and running a news organization during this outbreak.

967
0:42:44.542,000 --> 0:42:45,000
You know, what are some of the --

968
0:42:46.167,000 --> 0:42:48,000
First, what is that like, to run a news organization,

969
0:42:48.668,000 --> 0:42:5,000
to report during this outbreak?

970
0:42:51.083,000 --> 0:42:54,000
GL: Well, running a news organization in a moment like this,

971
0:42:54.625,000 --> 0:42:56,000
so close to the initial epicenter where the outbreak started,

972
0:42:57.542,000 --> 0:42:58,000
is complicated.

973
0:42:58.833,000 --> 0:43:,000
We were lucky, very, very lucky

974
0:43:01.417,000 --> 0:43:03,000
that most of our senior editors,

975
0:43:03.5,000 --> 0:43:04,000
and certainly the most senior editors,

976
0:43:05.375,000 --> 0:43:07,000
our editor in chief, our masthead leadership,

977
0:43:07.708,000 --> 0:43:09,000
they were all journalists and they were reporters during SARS.

978
0:43:10.637,000 --> 0:43:12,000
So there's a lot of pattern recognition in our newsroom.

979
0:43:13.333,000 --> 0:43:16,000
Which meant the moment that we got the first,

980
0:43:16.583,000 --> 0:43:18,000
sort of, the first stories coming out of China,

981
0:43:19,000 --> 0:43:2,000
starting on December 30,

982
0:43:20.375,000 --> 0:43:22,000
people already raising their hands in the newsroom saying,

983
0:43:23.25,000 --> 0:43:25,000
"Hey, we've got to report about this

984
0:43:26.042,000 --> 0:43:27,000
like it's going to be the next SARS.

985
0:43:27.833,000 --> 0:43:3,000
There's a high likelihood that this is it."

986
0:43:30.875,000 --> 0:43:33,000
And we did send people to Wuhan early on in January.

987
0:43:34.292,000 --> 0:43:37,000
Like I said, we also had reporters there right before the lockdown.

988
0:43:37.459,000 --> 0:43:41,000
After the lockdown, we were lucky enough to pull all of them out of Wuhan.

989
0:43:42.042,000 --> 0:43:44,000
But we actually did change very quickly

990
0:43:44.292,000 --> 0:43:45,000
the way that we report.

991
0:43:46,000 --> 0:43:48,000
Partially to make sure we got the story right,

992
0:43:48.167,000 --> 0:43:5,000
to dig deeper in the places that we knew we had to dig deeper,

993
0:43:51.125,000 --> 0:43:54,000
but also to protect our journalists and employees.

994
0:43:54.167,000 --> 0:43:55,000
So one of the things that we did do,

995
0:43:55.958,000 --> 0:43:58,000
and maybe other news organizations would disagree with our decision,

996
0:43:59.458,000 --> 0:44:03,000
was I think in late January or early February,

997
0:44:03.667,000 --> 0:44:04,000
even in Hong Kong,

998
0:44:05.5,000 --> 0:44:06,000
we said to our journalists,

999
0:44:07.167,000 --> 0:44:08,000
"You are not to go into hospitals."

1000
0:44:08.833,000 --> 0:44:09,000
So no more in-hospital reporting.

1001
0:44:10.833,000 --> 0:44:12,000
Because they were --

1002
0:44:13,000 --> 0:44:15,000
we knew that it was highly infectious,

1003
0:44:15.167,000 --> 0:44:17,000
we were worried that they were going to become

1004
0:44:17.5,000 --> 0:44:18,000
you know, points of spread,

1005
0:44:19.083,000 --> 0:44:21,000
and we just wanted to protect our employees and our company,

1006
0:44:21.917,000 --> 0:44:22,000
so we did that.

1007
0:44:23.208,000 --> 0:44:25,000
We also had a business continuity plan.

1008
0:44:25.5,000 --> 0:44:26,000
Which meant that at the drop of a dime

1009
0:44:27.375,000 --> 0:44:28,000
we could shut down the entire office

1010
0:44:29.167,000 --> 0:44:31,000
and still operate this global news business.

1011
0:44:31.333,000 --> 0:44:33,000
Some of the most interesting stories we've covered

1012
0:44:33.708,000 --> 0:44:37,000
is actually how technology has played a huge role in China

1013
0:44:38.25,000 --> 0:44:4,000
during this epidemic.

1014
0:44:40.542,000 --> 0:44:43,000
Because it frankly has changed the way that diagnostics work,

1015
0:44:44.25,000 --> 0:44:46,000
it changed the way that containment works,

1016
0:44:46.542,000 --> 0:44:5,000
it certainly has changed the way that consumer life works.

1017
0:44:50.708,000 --> 0:44:51,000
And of course,

1018
0:44:52,000 --> 0:44:55,000
there's been a lot of instances of really interesting censorship,

1019
0:44:55.083,000 --> 0:44:56,000
but also, more interestingly,

1020
0:44:56.708,000 --> 0:44:58,000
how the Chinese netizens have fought that censorship

1021
0:44:59.208,000 --> 0:45:,000
and reacted to that censorship.

1022
0:45:00.792,000 --> 0:45:02,000
And I do think that there's quite a lot of lasting impacts

1023
0:45:03.625,000 --> 0:45:04,000
that are likely to happen

1024
0:45:04.958,000 --> 0:45:06,000
because of technology deployment during this time.

1025
0:45:08.875,000 --> 0:45:11,000
WPR: And so I think in talking about some of those lasting impacts,

1026
0:45:12.042,000 --> 0:45:15,000
now that you as a country are sort of emerging from this

1027
0:45:15.792,000 --> 0:45:18,000
and coming on into a different stage with this outbreak,

1028
0:45:19.75,000 --> 0:45:21,000
what are some of the changes you're seeing to daily life,

1029
0:45:22.583,000 --> 0:45:23,000
both as society,

1030
0:45:24,000 --> 0:45:27,000
and maybe things that you're hearing that individuals are experiencing

1031
0:45:27.333,000 --> 0:45:28,000
as a result of this?

1032
0:45:29.667,000 --> 0:45:32,000
GL: Yeah, I think probably the two most interesting changes,

1033
0:45:32.833,000 --> 0:45:33,000
actually, I should say three --

1034
0:45:34.583,000 --> 0:45:37,000
The first one is on education.

1035
0:45:38.292,000 --> 0:45:4,000
Now schools have been shut down across China

1036
0:45:40.375,000 --> 0:45:41,000
for quite some time now

1037
0:45:41.667,000 --> 0:45:45,000
and again, this might feel a little bit stereotypical,

1038
0:45:46.125,000 --> 0:45:47,000
or a caricature of China,

1039
0:45:47.417,000 --> 0:45:49,000
but education is extremely important to the country

1040
0:45:49.875,000 --> 0:45:5,000
and extremely important to the citizens.

1041
0:45:51.833,000 --> 0:45:54,000
And we were actually just about to come up to the national exams,

1042
0:45:55.25,000 --> 0:45:57,000
which these students work 18 years for.

1043
0:45:58.042,000 --> 0:46:01,000
And so online education -- very, very quickly moved online.

1044
0:46:01.625,000 --> 0:46:03,000
And part of that move online

1045
0:46:03.958,000 --> 0:46:08,000
was that courses had to be, and classes had to be recorded.

1046
0:46:09.208,000 --> 0:46:12,000
Which means that now, there's this huge repository

1047
0:46:12.708,000 --> 0:46:14,000
of recorded classes.

1048
0:46:14.917,000 --> 0:46:17,000
That means potential democratization of education material,

1049
0:46:18.792,000 --> 0:46:23,000
and significantly lowered costs to get this type of coursework

1050
0:46:24.417,000 --> 0:46:25,000
from the top tiered schools,

1051
0:46:25.917,000 --> 0:46:27,000
whether it's high schools, universities or primary schools,

1052
0:46:28.708,000 --> 0:46:29,000
to the entire country.

1053
0:46:3,000 --> 0:46:32,000
Now whether or not China activates on that,

1054
0:46:32.083,000 --> 0:46:33,000
we're still not sure,

1055
0:46:33.375,000 --> 0:46:34,000
but the potential is there.

1056
0:46:34.75,000 --> 0:46:36,000
The second major shift is really on distributed workforce.

1057
0:46:37.5,000 --> 0:46:39,000
The idea of working remotely,

1058
0:46:39.917,000 --> 0:46:42,000
office work remotely, is not much of a concept in China

1059
0:46:43.708,000 --> 0:46:44,000
and across most of Asia.

1060
0:46:45,000 --> 0:46:47,000
Certainly far less than in the United States.

1061
0:46:47.917,000 --> 0:46:48,000
And I'm from the US tech industry,

1062
0:46:49.833,000 --> 0:46:5,000
so it was pretty normal,

1063
0:46:51.833,000 --> 0:46:53,000
it's pretty normal in the US tech industry even before this,

1064
0:46:54.708,000 --> 0:46:55,000
in China much less so.

1065
0:46:56.542,000 --> 0:46:57,000
But because of the lockdowns,

1066
0:46:57.958,000 --> 0:47:,000
not only in Hubei but across China,

1067
0:47:01.208,000 --> 0:47:04,000
this has become much more normal.

1068
0:47:04.875,000 --> 0:47:07,000
And people are kind of falling into a different rhythm of work.

1069
0:47:08.208,000 --> 0:47:09,000
And most importantly,

1070
0:47:10.125,000 --> 0:47:12,000
this has given rise to a whole new set

1071
0:47:12.333,000 --> 0:47:14,000
of teleconferencing companies in China.

1072
0:47:14.625,000 --> 0:47:18,000
Because most of the teleconferencing companies that we know of in the West,

1073
0:47:19.583,000 --> 0:47:22,000
whether it's the Cisco systems, Google Hangouts, Zoom,

1074
0:47:22.667,000 --> 0:47:23,000
that everyone uses,

1075
0:47:23.958,000 --> 0:47:24,000
BlueJeans, Slack video,

1076
0:47:25.75,000 --> 0:47:26,000
they're not available in China.

1077
0:47:27.542,000 --> 0:47:28,000
They don't work in China.

1078
0:47:29.208,000 --> 0:47:3,000
There is this mirror internet in China,

1079
0:47:31.208,000 --> 0:47:32,000
behind the Great Firewall,

1080
0:47:32.625,000 --> 0:47:36,000
and so there's a whole new set of teleconferencing systems

1081
0:47:36.958,000 --> 0:47:37,000
that were used,

1082
0:47:38.333,000 --> 0:47:39,000
but were not really commonplace,

1083
0:47:39.917,000 --> 0:47:4,000
certainly not for distributed workforce,

1084
0:47:41.875,000 --> 0:47:43,000
and now suddenly, over the last few months, they are.

1085
0:47:44.458,000 --> 0:47:45,000
So it will be interesting to see

1086
0:47:46.042,000 --> 0:47:48,000
how those companies and those services develop,

1087
0:47:48.333,000 --> 0:47:5,000
and whether or not the workplace changes in China.

1088
0:47:51,000 --> 0:47:53,000
And then finally, the third thing that is really interesting

1089
0:47:53.875,000 --> 0:47:57,000
is that there was a huge internet response

1090
0:47:58.833,000 --> 0:48:01,000
to this censorship issue in China

1091
0:48:02.042,000 --> 0:48:05,000
over the course of the last two months.

1092
0:48:05.542,000 --> 0:48:08,000
It especially exploded after this whistle blower, Dr. Li,

1093
0:48:08.75,000 --> 0:48:09,000
died on February 7.

1094
0:48:10.75,000 --> 0:48:11,000
All over the Chinese internet

1095
0:48:12.375,000 --> 0:48:14,000
hashtags like "we want freedom of speech,"

1096
0:48:15,000 --> 0:48:16,000
"national hero Dr. Li,"

1097
0:48:16.625,000 --> 0:48:18,000
things like that just exploded everywhere.

1098
0:48:19.125,000 --> 0:48:2,000
And there have been --

1099
0:48:21.083,000 --> 0:48:23,000
And actually the Chinese government has had to respond,

1100
0:48:23.708,000 --> 0:48:24,000
I think for observers,

1101
0:48:25,000 --> 0:48:26,000
a lot of observers believe

1102
0:48:26.333,000 --> 0:48:3,000
that Chinese government's change of narrative about Dr. Li

1103
0:48:30.5,000 --> 0:48:35,000
was largely driven by this reaction from its citizens across the internet.

1104
0:48:36.292,000 --> 0:48:38,000
There have been extremely creative examples

1105
0:48:39.125,000 --> 0:48:41,000
of people getting around censorship.

1106
0:48:41.25,000 --> 0:48:43,000
I think China is quite famous for using emojis

1107
0:48:44.25,000 --> 0:48:46,000
to get around tech censorship.

1108
0:48:46.458,000 --> 0:48:47,000
I think most people also know

1109
0:48:47.917,000 --> 0:48:5,000
that the primary messaging app that the Chinese internet users use,

1110
0:48:51.084,000 --> 0:48:52,000
called WeChat,

1111
0:48:52.375,000 --> 0:48:53,000
it is heavily censored,

1112
0:48:53.667,000 --> 0:48:54,000
it's not just text that's censored,

1113
0:48:55.542,000 --> 0:48:57,000
images are censored really effectively,

1114
0:48:58.333,000 --> 0:49:,000
individual conversations are censored.

1115
0:49:00.708,000 --> 0:49:02,000
And so when there are specific articles

1116
0:49:03.458,000 --> 0:49:07,000
or specific posts that are about what's happening with the virus

1117
0:49:08.083,000 --> 0:49:09,000
that people want to share,

1118
0:49:09.75,000 --> 0:49:12,000
and the government thinks that it is detrimental to whatever,

1119
0:49:13.25,000 --> 0:49:18,000
they will censor and it will be completely and very effectively removed.

1120
0:49:18.458,000 --> 0:49:22,000
But this time around, Chinese citizens used emojis again.

1121
0:49:23.042,000 --> 0:49:27,000
They translated these posts into ancient Chinese texts

1122
0:49:27.75,000 --> 0:49:31,000
that the censoring machines couldn't pick up yet,

1123
0:49:32.083,000 --> 0:49:35,000
they actually translated one version of this post

1124
0:49:35.292,000 --> 0:49:36,000
into Tolkien's Elvish language,

1125
0:49:36.875,000 --> 0:49:38,000
I don't even know the name of that language,

1126
0:49:38.958,000 --> 0:49:4,000
they translated into that and the AI couldn't pick it up.

1127
0:49:41.708,000 --> 0:49:42,000
And then finally,

1128
0:49:43,000 --> 0:49:45,000
I think one of my favorite versions of this

1129
0:49:45.083,000 --> 0:49:46,000
was they used the "Star Wars" intro,

1130
0:49:46.875,000 --> 0:49:48,000
the angled text scrolling,

1131
0:49:49.208,000 --> 0:49:5,000
it became a video,

1132
0:49:50.5,000 --> 0:49:52,000
and they had the entire post about what was going on in Wuhan

1133
0:49:53.417,000 --> 0:49:54,000
in that format,

1134
0:49:54.708,000 --> 0:49:55,000
and that went all over the internet.

1135
0:49:56.5,000 --> 0:49:58,000
So I do think that there is going to be an increased call.

1136
0:49:59.292,000 --> 0:50:02,000
Academics now are speaking up about freedom of speech.

1137
0:50:02.625,000 --> 0:50:06,000
So there's going to be this increased volume of netizens

1138
0:50:06.917,000 --> 0:50:08,000
calling for freedom of speech.

1139
0:50:09.125,000 --> 0:50:11,000
It will be very, very interesting to watch

1140
0:50:11.167,000 --> 0:50:13,000
how the authorities in China deal with that.

1141
0:50:14.417,000 --> 0:50:16,000
WPR: Great. And Chris, you have a question?

1142
0:50:18.292,000 --> 0:50:19,000
CA: Yeah, it sort of picks up on that

1143
0:50:20.125,000 --> 0:50:24,000
about, you know, the stories that could come out of this.

1144
0:50:24.417,000 --> 0:50:26,000
I mean, there are definitely optimistic stories

1145
0:50:26.792,000 --> 0:50:27,000
that people are feeling,

1146
0:50:28.083,000 --> 0:50:34,000
that this could lead to more free speech of a certain kind in China.

1147
0:50:34.5,000 --> 0:50:36,000
Certain things you can't suppress.

1148
0:50:37.625,000 --> 0:50:41,000
Maybe in the US it might lead to the government taking

1149
0:50:42.167,000 --> 0:50:44,000
scientific predictions more seriously,

1150
0:50:44.667,000 --> 0:50:45,000
not clear that's happening yet.

1151
0:50:47.708,000 --> 0:50:49,000
And there's hope that this whole thing,

1152
0:50:50.542,000 --> 0:50:52,000
because it's a common enemy for the world,

1153
0:50:52.583,000 --> 0:50:54,000
will actually bring the world together in some ways.

1154
0:50:55.083,000 --> 0:50:57,000
But I'm curious how you think about this.

1155
0:50:57.75,000 --> 0:51:01,000
President Trump started referring to this as the Chinese virus.

1156
0:51:02.125,000 --> 0:51:05,000
I'm curious how that's being received in China,

1157
0:51:05.417,000 --> 0:51:08,000
and how people are feeling on this issue.

1158
0:51:09.167,000 --> 0:51:13,000
Do you think it's increased sympathy for other countries

1159
0:51:13.292,000 --> 0:51:15,000
or actually dialed up animosity?

1160
0:51:17.083,000 --> 0:51:19,000
GL: Well, it's certainly not being received well across China.

1161
0:51:20.042,000 --> 0:51:23,000
I think one thing that is still really undercovered

1162
0:51:23.5,000 --> 0:51:27,000
is the intensity of rising nationalism

1163
0:51:28.125,000 --> 0:51:3,000
at the grassroots level across China

1164
0:51:30.25,000 --> 0:51:31,000
over the last several years.

1165
0:51:32.25,000 --> 0:51:34,000
And they're very protective of their country,

1166
0:51:34.375,000 --> 0:51:35,000
and their people and their history.

1167
0:51:36.125,000 --> 0:51:38,000
And President Trump's comments

1168
0:51:38.458,000 --> 0:51:4,000
and the fact that so much of the US government

1169
0:51:40.667,000 --> 0:51:42,000
is now referring to this as the Chinese virus

1170
0:51:42.833,000 --> 0:51:43,000
is not received well.

1171
0:51:44.833,000 --> 0:51:48,000
You know, my fear of course, is that even prior to the virus,

1172
0:51:49.292,000 --> 0:51:51,000
the US-China conflict was escalating

1173
0:51:51.667,000 --> 0:51:54,000
beyond anything that I think most of us as observers want to see.

1174
0:51:55.042,000 --> 0:51:58,000
Trade, tech, military, ideology,

1175
0:51:58.25,000 --> 0:52:01,000
and now we can add information conflict

1176
0:52:01.625,000 --> 0:52:05,000
and health conflict, health tech conflict especially,

1177
0:52:05.792,000 --> 0:52:06,000
to the list.

1178
0:52:07.25,000 --> 0:52:11,000
Of course, the hope is that these heightened tensions

1179
0:52:12.042,000 --> 0:52:13,000
will actually dissipate

1180
0:52:13.333,000 --> 0:52:16,000
and that the two countries can actually, at this moment in time,

1181
0:52:16.375,000 --> 0:52:17,000
choose to go down one of two paths.

1182
0:52:18.083,000 --> 0:52:21,000
Either one that further damages the relationship

1183
0:52:21.417,000 --> 0:52:24,000
or one that actually shows what the possibilities are

1184
0:52:24.458,000 --> 0:52:26,000
if the two largest economies in the world,

1185
0:52:26.5,000 --> 0:52:28,000
the two most powerful countries in the world,

1186
0:52:28.75,000 --> 0:52:29,000
actually cooperate.

1187
0:52:30.208,000 --> 0:52:33,000
You know, this week, Thursday is the G20 conversations

1188
0:52:33.875,000 --> 0:52:35,000
that are going to happen remotely.

1189
0:52:36.042,000 --> 0:52:38,000
It will be interesting to see how US and China

1190
0:52:39.042,000 --> 0:52:4,000
actually coordinate, cooperate,

1191
0:52:40.792,000 --> 0:52:42,000
how they communicate during those talks.

1192
0:52:43.708,000 --> 0:52:45,000
CA: I think people want to know

1193
0:52:45.792,000 --> 0:52:48,000
how you think this will play out.

1194
0:52:48.917,000 --> 0:52:5,000
You've got a very special seat there,

1195
0:52:51.542,000 --> 0:52:54,000
you know, looking at all parts of the world in it.

1196
0:52:55.417,000 --> 0:52:58,000
What's your take on how this plays out?

1197
0:52:59.917,000 --> 0:53:01,000
GL: I desperately want to be an optimist, Chris.

1198
0:53:02.333,000 --> 0:53:05,000
But I think that everything we see, especially the data,

1199
0:53:05.917,000 --> 0:53:08,000
shows that it is going to get far worse before it get better.

1200
0:53:09.583,000 --> 0:53:12,000
And I'm very fearful for what's going on in the United States.

1201
0:53:12.833,000 --> 0:53:15,000
It's because of the amount of data we have

1202
0:53:16.333,000 --> 0:53:18,000
across all these different countries,

1203
0:53:18.5,000 --> 0:53:2,000
you can very clearly layer countries

1204
0:53:21.417,000 --> 0:53:23,000
and the way that the pandemic has been spreading,

1205
0:53:24.125,000 --> 0:53:25,000
on top of one another,

1206
0:53:25.417,000 --> 0:53:28,000
and we know that the US is a week and a half,

1207
0:53:29,000 --> 0:53:3,000
maybe two weeks, behind Italy,

1208
0:53:30.833,000 --> 0:53:34,000
and we know what happened in Italy and what's going on in Spain.

1209
0:53:34.875,000 --> 0:53:36,000
The US is catching up on that spike

1210
0:53:37.042,000 --> 0:53:39,000
and it's going to come much faster,

1211
0:53:39.583,000 --> 0:53:4,000
and it's going to be much higher

1212
0:53:41.167,000 --> 0:53:43,000
than I think most people originally believed or hoped for.

1213
0:53:44.125,000 --> 0:53:46,000
So it will get worse.

1214
0:53:46.625,000 --> 0:53:48,000
So the hope is that,

1215
0:53:48.958,000 --> 0:53:5,000
again, this is going to be the optimistic side of me,

1216
0:53:51.542,000 --> 0:53:52,000
that the nations will come together,

1217
0:53:53.5,000 --> 0:53:55,000
that those in charge, our governments,

1218
0:53:55.667,000 --> 0:53:58,000
will make the drastic, necessary moves,

1219
0:53:59.542,000 --> 0:54:03,000
and we will be able to come out on the other side faster

1220
0:54:04.333,000 --> 0:54:05,000
than it looks right now.

1221
0:54:06.25,000 --> 0:54:08,000
Remember, when China went to shutdown,

1222
0:54:08.458,000 --> 0:54:09,000
on January 23,

1223
0:54:10.042,000 --> 0:54:13,000
there were only 830 confirmed cases.

1224
0:54:13.583,000 --> 0:54:15,000
And even if those numbers are not exactly accurate,

1225
0:54:16.042,000 --> 0:54:2,000
it's nowhere near the confirmed cases that we have in the US right now,

1226
0:54:20.542,000 --> 0:54:21,000
that we see in the US.

1227
0:54:22.292,000 --> 0:54:24,000
So that is something to be very, very concerned about.

1228
0:54:25.292,000 --> 0:54:26,000
At 830 they shut down.

1229
0:54:27.292,000 --> 0:54:29,000
And even after the shutdown, two weeks later,

1230
0:54:29.792,000 --> 0:54:3,000
the cases had grown to 35,000,

1231
0:54:31.75,000 --> 0:54:34,000
two weeks after that, it was at 75,000.

1232
0:54:35.5,000 --> 0:54:38,000
So at this point, it is late in the US.

1233
0:54:39.375,000 --> 0:54:41,000
But, we, you know --

1234
0:54:41.958,000 --> 0:54:42,000
it can still be fixed.

1235
0:54:43.792,000 --> 0:54:44,000
And I think most ...

1236
0:54:47.25,000 --> 0:54:49,000
experts that we talk to believe that it can be fixed

1237
0:54:49.75,000 --> 0:54:51,000
with fast and decisive action.

1238
0:54:52.75,000 --> 0:54:54,000
CA: Yeah, people struggle with understanding the power

1239
0:54:55.333,000 --> 0:54:56,000
of exponential growth.

1240
0:54:56.625,000 --> 0:54:58,000
And a number can seem smallish today,

1241
0:54:59.292,000 --> 0:55:02,000
but if you believe the science,

1242
0:55:03.125,000 --> 0:55:05,000
yeah, you have to act.

1243
0:55:05.292,000 --> 0:55:07,000
Gary, look, I hope somehow

1244
0:55:07.417,000 --> 0:55:09,000
you will convey to whomever you can convey

1245
0:55:10.417,000 --> 0:55:13,000
that regardless of what some people might say,

1246
0:55:13.917,000 --> 0:55:14,000
in government or elsewhere,

1247
0:55:15.458,000 --> 0:55:17,000
there are millions, there are tens of millions,

1248
0:55:17.875,000 --> 0:55:2,000
there are probably hundreds of millions of people in the US,

1249
0:55:21.042,000 --> 0:55:22,000
on both right and left,

1250
0:55:22.333,000 --> 0:55:26,000
who are amazed by what happened in China.

1251
0:55:27.208,000 --> 0:55:29,000
You know, yes, missteps early on, whatever.

1252
0:55:30.208,000 --> 0:55:31,000
But they're amazed,

1253
0:55:31.5,000 --> 0:55:33,000
you've really --

1254
0:55:33.625,000 --> 0:55:36,000
you know, both the Chinese government, the Hong Kong government,

1255
0:55:36.667,000 --> 0:55:38,000
several Asian governments, Singapore, South Korea,

1256
0:55:39.125,000 --> 0:55:44,000
have shown astonishingly wise and disciplined action

1257
0:55:44.792,000 --> 0:55:45,000
against this thing.

1258
0:55:46.292,000 --> 0:55:47,000
And we're grateful,

1259
0:55:47.958,000 --> 0:55:5,000
we feel there is much we can learn from you

1260
0:55:51.208,000 --> 0:55:53,000
and so --

1261
0:55:55.417,000 --> 0:55:59,000
People, most people want this to be a time of bringing the world together.

1262
0:56:00.083,000 --> 0:56:01,000
I genuinely believe that,

1263
0:56:01.583,000 --> 0:56:03,000
it's maybe the optimistic part of me believing it.

1264
0:56:03.958,000 --> 0:56:04,000
But I believe in it,

1265
0:56:05.25,000 --> 0:56:07,000
it's partly what these conversations are for,

1266
0:56:07.583,000 --> 0:56:09,000
to try and make those kinds of connections.

1267
0:56:11.833,000 --> 0:56:12,000
We want to keep in touch.

1268
0:56:13.125,000 --> 0:56:14,000
You've got an amazing seat there,

1269
0:56:14.75,000 --> 0:56:17,000
and I have loved listening to every word you've said today here.

1270
0:56:18.542,000 --> 0:56:19,000
It's just I've learned so much from you.

1271
0:56:20.542,000 --> 0:56:21,000
So thank you for that.

1272
0:56:21.833,000 --> 0:56:22,000
GL: It was a great conversation.

1273
0:56:23.708,000 --> 0:56:24,000
WPR: Thank you for your insight.

1274
0:56:25.667,000 --> 0:56:27,000
CA: And thank you to our whole online audience,

1275
0:56:28.5,000 --> 0:56:29,000
I mean, this is a journey,

1276
0:56:29.833,000 --> 0:56:33,000
every day we're learning something new.

1277
0:56:33.875,000 --> 0:56:36,000
And just in case anyone out there is feeling a little bit powerless,

1278
0:56:37.125,000 --> 0:56:39,000
and afraid or you know, at the situation,

1279
0:56:39.917,000 --> 0:56:43,000
I mean, the one thing that everyone can do right now, I think,

1280
0:56:44,000 --> 0:56:46,000
is we can reach out to the people we know,

1281
0:56:46.042,000 --> 0:56:49,000
we can encourage each of us to be our best selves

1282
0:56:49.292,000 --> 0:56:5,000
in this moment.

1283
0:56:50.583,000 --> 0:56:52,000
I really think it's what the world is going to need,

1284
0:56:53.083,000 --> 0:56:54,000
when people are angry and fearful,

1285
0:56:54.875,000 --> 0:56:56,000
we can turn into nasty people.

1286
0:56:57.292,000 --> 0:56:58,000
But when we're --

1287
0:57:01.25,000 --> 0:57:04,000
When we realize how much we need each other,

1288
0:57:04.625,000 --> 0:57:08,000
and are willing to just reach out and share stories of hope

1289
0:57:08.708,000 --> 0:57:11,000
and share what we're feeling

1290
0:57:12.125,000 --> 0:57:14,000
and share possibilities,

1291
0:57:14.625,000 --> 0:57:15,000
we can really impact each other,

1292
0:57:16.542,000 --> 0:57:2,000
and I see so many incredible instances of that

1293
0:57:20.917,000 --> 0:57:21,000
from around the world,

1294
0:57:22.208,000 --> 0:57:24,000
whether it's Italians singing to each other joyfully

1295
0:57:24.708,000 --> 0:57:25,000
from each other's balconies,

1296
0:57:26.458,000 --> 0:57:27,000
or these sort of tales of heroism

1297
0:57:28.417,000 --> 0:57:31,000
that some of our health workers have been engaged in

1298
0:57:32.25,000 --> 0:57:33,000
all around the world.

1299
0:57:33.542,000 --> 0:57:36,000
There's going to need to be a lot more of that.

1300
0:57:36.667,000 --> 0:57:39,000
And honestly, every single person can play a part in how they are online,

1301
0:57:40.667,000 --> 0:57:41,000
what they share,

1302
0:57:42.542,000 --> 0:57:43,000
how they react.

1303
0:57:43.833,000 --> 0:57:45,000
So I don't want to be overly, embarrassingly Kumbaya,

1304
0:57:46.625,000 --> 0:57:49,000
but I kind of think we need that spirit right now a little bit.

1305
0:57:49.875,000 --> 0:57:5,000
We need each other,

1306
0:57:51.167,000 --> 0:57:54,000
and TED is going to try and play that role a bit.

1307
0:57:55.042,000 --> 0:57:56,000
So if you hate that,

1308
0:57:56.333,000 --> 0:57:57,000
maybe you don't need to be here,

1309
0:57:57.917,000 --> 0:57:59,000
but I hope you don't hate that.

1310
0:58:00.083,000 --> 0:58:02,000
I hope you like that and will be part of it.

1311
0:58:02.958,000 --> 0:58:04,000
Whitney, it's so fun cohosting these,

1312
0:58:05.375,000 --> 0:58:07,000
thanks to the rest of the amazing TED team

1313
0:58:07.458,000 --> 0:58:09,000
who are everyone in our individual homes,

1314
0:58:10.25,000 --> 0:58:11,000
they are sort of racing around,

1315
0:58:11.833,000 --> 0:58:13,000
trying to make this stuff work technically.

1316
0:58:13.917,000 --> 0:58:14,000
We're learning a bit each day, I hope.

1317
0:58:15.917,000 --> 0:58:17,000
Thanks so much for being part of this.

1318
0:58:18.167,000 --> 0:58:19,000
WPR: Thank you, everyone, thank you.

1319
0:58:2,000 --> 0:58:21,000
We'll see you all back here tomorrow.

1
0:00:12.94,000 --> 0:00:13,000
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]

2
0:00:16.74,000 --> 0:00:18,000
[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]

3
0:00:21.46,000 --> 0:00:23,000
[whose wealth and resources surpass all that Europe ever had,]

4
0:00:24.46,000 --> 0:00:26,000
[whose altar is filled with gold.]

5
0:00:30.18,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This chant is called the oríkì.

6
0:00:32.42,000 --> 0:00:35,000
My grandmother used to sing it to me when I was a child in Nigeria.

7
0:00:37.82,000 --> 0:00:4,000
See, an oríkì is the song of praise of the Yoruba people,

8
0:00:41.06,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and this particularly speaks of treasures that the West does not have.

9
0:00:46.66,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Mama -- that's what I call my grandmother --

10
0:00:48.78,000 --> 0:00:5,000
told me many stories about Yoruba mythology.

11
0:00:51.82,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of Nigeria,

12
0:00:55.78,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I was always fascinated by these stories.

13
0:00:57.94,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was always intrigued.

14
0:00:59.74,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And Yoruba culture has inspired my art since I was a child.

15
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You see, African art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York.

16
0:01:07.34,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Every artist has a name,

17
0:01:10.42,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and every artist has a story.

18
0:01:12.5,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is my story.

19
0:01:15.46,000 --> 0:01:18,000
See, mama had tattoos on her arms and her legs.

20
0:01:19.1,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As a child, I thought she was born with them,

21
0:01:21.38,000 --> 0:01:23,000
with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols.

22
0:01:24.06,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And then she told me

23
0:01:25.34,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that they were actually symbols from the Yoruba mythology.

24
0:01:29.14,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I never knew how this was going to influence the artist that I am today.

25
0:01:33.34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You see, as a young child, I saw art everywhere.

26
0:01:35.78,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I remember the house we lived in in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.

27
0:01:39.54,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We had marble floors,

28
0:01:41.14,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and you know, I would look at the marble floors,

29
0:01:43.74,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I would see all sorts of patterns and designs in it,

30
0:01:46.42,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I thought everybody could see them.

31
0:01:48.34,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I would call my brother, and I would be like,

32
0:01:50.62,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design, see this pattern, see this mask."

33
0:01:54.18,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And he would tell me, "Laolu, I don't see anything."

34
0:01:56.66,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So I would use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor.

35
0:01:59.78,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And then when my mom noticed, she got really upset.

36
0:02:02.38,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:03.98,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But that didn't stop me.

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I switched from ink to chalk,

39
0:02:06.94,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because I got in trouble a lot with my teachers and my parents.

40
0:02:09.94,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So I remember my mom said, "Laolu, we are Christians.

41
0:02:12.86,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Why don't you draw like other people?

42
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Why don't you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,

43
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or maybe even draw Jesus?"

44
0:02:21.22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You know, I could paint the whole house if I had a chance,

45
0:02:23.98,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but when I grew up, I knew being an artist was not an option,

46
0:02:26.94,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so I wanted to be the person my parents wanted me to be,

47
0:02:29.94,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so I went to law school.

48
0:02:31.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Of course, that's my dad there. He was so proud that day.

49
0:02:35.34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And this was what my notebooks looked like in law school.

50
0:02:38.66,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Of course I would miss classes,

52
0:02:42.79,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I would make up excuses why I wasn't going to class.

53
0:02:46.98,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But when I started working at the Human Rights Commission

54
0:02:49.7,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as a human rights attorney,

55
0:02:51.06,000 --> 0:02:52,000
my mind was elsewhere.

56
0:02:53.14,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I saw a very tough reality.

57
0:02:55.94,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I worked with children

58
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who had to choose between getting an education

59
0:03:00.06,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and actually being forced into marriage.

60
0:03:02.78,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I was so frustrated seeing all the injustice around me,

61
0:03:06.38,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and my only outlet was art,

62
0:03:07.98,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so I started painting.

63
0:03:09.98,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This piece is called "Dreamscape."

64
0:03:11.86,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So when you zoom into this piece,

65
0:03:13.5,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you're going to see a girl child

66
0:03:15.9,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the accidental birth,

67
0:03:17.78,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the fact that our future is controlled by where we are born.

68
0:03:23.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, the next one you see a man and a man holding hands,

69
0:03:26.94,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a woman and a woman holding hands.

70
0:03:28.82,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You see, in Nigeria, same-sex relationship is criminalized.

71
0:03:32.98,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You can actually get 14 years for that.

72
0:03:35.5,000 --> 0:03:37,000
With my art, I like to tell stories.

73
0:03:37.54,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Through my art, I like to start a conversation.

74
0:03:39.78,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So in this one, you see the map of Africa,

75
0:03:42.02,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you see the questions, you see crying,

76
0:03:43.9,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and there you see syringes plugged into Africa

77
0:03:46.1,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the natural resources being drained out.

78
0:03:48.22,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So I asked myself, where does it go?

79
0:03:50.78,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Who benefits from all of this?

80
0:03:53.46,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You see, with my art,

81
0:03:54.74,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the way I weave my art around the patterns, the masks, the stories,

82
0:03:58.62,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the way I use my lines,

83
0:03:59.98,000 --> 0:04:,000
it's all from the Yoruba culture.

84
0:04:01.74,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So in 2013, I made a big gamble.

85
0:04:04.3,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I quit my job and I moved to New York City to practice art full time.

86
0:04:08.66,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Of course, my parents were like,

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Oh, [it's just a phase.] He'll come back."

88
0:04:12.94,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But life as an artist in New York was not easy,

89
0:04:15.94,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because I was broke,

90
0:04:17.98,000 --> 0:04:19,000
no money, no gallery agents, no representation,

91
0:04:20.94,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so no gallery would show my work.

92
0:04:22.58,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I thought to myself, I need to survive.

93
0:04:24.74,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So I started painting on clothes to make a living.

94
0:04:28.339,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I started painting on shoes.

95
0:04:30.339,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I started customizing things for people.

96
0:04:32.659,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then soon I realized the power,

97
0:04:34.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because people were so proud to wear their stories.

98
0:04:38.06,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So I started painting on everything.

99
0:04:40.02,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I painted on guitars,

100
0:04:41.58,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I started doing murals,

101
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:44,000
anything I could find my hand on I painted,

102
0:04:44.9,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and everything became my canvas.

103
0:04:46.74,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So one day, I was just going on my Instagram feed,

104
0:04:50.06,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and I saw this picture.

105
0:04:51.54,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was Reign. She took a picture standing in front my art,

106
0:04:54.66,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the moment I saw that photo,

107
0:04:56.42,000 --> 0:04:57,000
something happened in that moment.

108
0:04:58.1,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I could actually see my artwork go into her and come out of her literally,

109
0:05:02.54,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that's how I started painting on human bodies.

110
0:05:06.74,000 --> 0:05:08,000
As a child I saw art on the marble floors,

111
0:05:09.62,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I saw art on walls,

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but now I see art on people's faces and people's bodies.

113
0:05:14.74,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I remember my grandmother,

114
0:05:16.78,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I realized that most of my creative instincts

115
0:05:19.66,000 --> 0:05:21,000
were actually based on my childhood memories

116
0:05:22.74,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and the art on my grandmother's skin.

117
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now I look at all the people I painted, and I think to myself, like,

118
0:05:28.38,000 --> 0:05:3,000
what would it look like if we all walked around

119
0:05:30.62,000 --> 0:05:32,000
like gods and goddesses from Yoruba mythology?

120
0:05:32.82,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And boom, that's how The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.

121
0:05:35.62,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology

122
0:05:38.14,000 --> 0:05:41,000
means your soul, it means your essence, it means your instincts.

123
0:05:41.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I realized that only when you tap into your Ori,

124
0:05:43.74,000 --> 0:05:45,000
then you can actually move mountains.

125
0:05:46.3,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So there's something so immediate about painting on human bodies.

126
0:05:51.46,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's like art in motion.

127
0:05:54.3,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's like a 3D experience.

128
0:05:56.38,000 --> 0:06:,000
So one day, I was just doing my regular work in Brooklyn,

129
0:06:01.18,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I got an email that said,

130
0:06:02.9,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.

131
0:06:05.22,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Would you like to paint for my music video?

132
0:06:07.261,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Signed, Beyoncé."

133
0:06:08.54,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Like, Beyoncé emailed me.

134
0:06:10.02,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was like, what?

135
0:06:11.38,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:13.06,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I was like, what, how did she even know me?

137
0:06:15.14,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I thought this can't be true. Of course I thought it was a scam.

138
0:06:18.18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The Nigerian in me was like, nah.

139
0:06:19.82,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:21.06,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Applause)

141
0:06:23.22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But incredibly enough, it was real, it was true,

142
0:06:25.7,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and things happened really fast.

143
0:06:27.3,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You see, Beyoncé wanted to pay homage to New Orleans,

144
0:06:29.82,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and my art reminded her of her creole origins.

145
0:06:33.1,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course,

146
0:06:35.46,000 --> 0:06:38,000
boom, everything just went from zero to 100 real fast.

147
0:06:40.02,000 --> 0:06:42,000
People featured me in magazines,

148
0:06:42.42,000 --> 0:06:43,000
interviews.

149
0:06:43.66,000 --> 0:06:44,000
People stopped me in the street.

150
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
People knew my name, like --

151
0:06:46.74,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And sometimes I had to step back

152
0:06:48.34,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and just chill, and, like, take everything in.

153
0:06:51.42,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You know, as artists, we work so hard all our lives

154
0:06:53.86,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for our art to be recognized,

155
0:06:55.3,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and for this I feel blessed.

156
0:06:57.06,000 --> 0:06:59,000
However, the attorney in me is still there,

157
0:06:59.14,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so I use my art to fight for what I believe in.

158
0:07:02.98,000 --> 0:07:04,000
My Yoruba heritage is always there.

159
0:07:05.62,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'd like to share with you tonight some of my art in motion.

160
0:07:10.58,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Please, welcome with me on stage.

161
0:07:12.94,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Music)

162
0:07:14.7,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

163
0:07:29.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.

164
0:07:32.62,000 --> 0:07:35,000
These are the first two people I ever painted in my life,

165
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I spent the past day painting on them.

166
0:07:39.7,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Tonight, they represent my hopes and my fears.

167
0:07:43.78,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, I put my fears on the back.

168
0:07:48.66,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I put my hopes in front.

169
0:07:52.7,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What are my hopes?

170
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I hope that people know

171
0:07:57.54,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that Africa is not just one huge, nameless continent

172
0:08:01.78,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that is all the same.

173
0:08:03.38,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I also hope that people know

174
0:08:04.78,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that in Nigeria, we have over 350 ethnic groups and languages,

175
0:08:10.78,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and I am just one artist from one of them.

176
0:08:13.54,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:18.22,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I also hope that you know that I hope I will be able to change

178
0:08:21.22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the way people talk about African art on the continent and here,

179
0:08:25.22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I hope you know that African art

180
0:08:26.98,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York

181
0:08:30.5,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and that every piece of art you see has a story,

182
0:08:33.38,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and every artist has a name.

183
0:08:35.02,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Thank you very much.

184
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Applause)

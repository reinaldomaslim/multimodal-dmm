1
0:00:13.927,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It is almost the end of the winter,

2
0:00:16.881,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and you've woken up to a cold house,

3
0:00:19.476,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which is weird, because you left the heater on all night.

4
0:00:24.124,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You turn on the light.

5
0:00:25.449,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's not working.

6
0:00:27.252,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Actually, the coffee maker, the TV -- none of them are working.

7
0:00:33.249,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Life outside also seems to have stopped.

8
0:00:36.796,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There are no schools,

9
0:00:38.648,000 --> 0:00:4,000
most of the businesses are shut,

10
0:00:40.913,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and there are no working trains.

11
0:00:43.852,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This is not the opening scene of a zombie apocalypse movie.

12
0:00:48.332,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is what happened in March 1989 in the Canadian province of Quebec,

13
0:00:54.268,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when the power grid lost power.

14
0:00:57.523,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The culprit?

15
0:00:59.106,000 --> 0:01:,000
A solar storm.

16
0:01:01.551,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles

17
0:01:04.638,000 --> 0:01:06,000
escaping from the Sun from time to time,

18
0:01:06.94,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and a constant reminder that we live in the neighborhood of an active star.

19
0:01:13.157,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I, as a solar physicist,

20
0:01:15.789,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I have a tremendous chance to study these solar storms.

21
0:01:19.533,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But you see, "solar storm chaser"

22
0:01:22.278,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is not just a cool title.

23
0:01:24.799,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My research helps to understand where they come from,

24
0:01:28.459,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how they behave

25
0:01:29.927,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and, in the long run,

26
0:01:31.126,000 --> 0:01:33,000
aims to mitigate their effects on human societies,

27
0:01:34.148,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which I'll get to in a second.

28
0:01:37.106,000 --> 0:01:42,000
At the beginning of the space exploration age 50 years ago only,

29
0:01:42.674,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the probes we sent in space

30
0:01:44.856,000 --> 0:01:46,000
revealed that the planets in our Solar System

31
0:01:47.694,000 --> 0:01:51,000
constantly bathe in a stream of particles that are coming from the Sun

32
0:01:52.168,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that we call the solar wind.

33
0:01:55.722,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And in the same way that global wind patterns here on Earth

34
0:01:59.363,000 --> 0:02:01,000
can be affected by hurricanes,

35
0:02:01.585,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the solar wind is sometimes affected by solar storms

36
0:02:05.37,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that I like to call "space hurricanes."

37
0:02:09.687,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When they arrive at planets,

38
0:02:11.664,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they can perturb the space environment,

39
0:02:13.913,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which in turn creates the northern or southern lights,

40
0:02:17.222,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for example, here on Earth,

41
0:02:19.434,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but also Saturn

42
0:02:21.953,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and also Jupiter.

43
0:02:25.151,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Luckily, here on Earth,

44
0:02:27.863,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we are protected by our planet's natural shield,

45
0:02:30.978,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a magnetic bubble that we call the magnetosphere

46
0:02:34.113,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and that you can see here on the right side.

47
0:02:37.281,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Nonetheless, solar storms can still be responsible

48
0:02:40.553,000 --> 0:02:44,000
for disrupting satellite telecommunications and operations,

49
0:02:45.191,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for disrupting navigation systems, such as GPS,

50
0:02:48.82,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as well as electric power transmission.

51
0:02:51.895,000 --> 0:02:56,000
All of these are technologies on which us humans rely more and more.

52
0:02:58.42,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow without a working cell phone --

53
0:03:03.692,000 --> 0:03:04,000
no internet on it,

54
0:03:05.269,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which means no social media.

55
0:03:07.799,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I mean, to me that would be worse than the zombie apocalypse.

56
0:03:10.747,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:12.605,000 --> 0:03:14,000
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though,

58
0:03:14.724,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we now know where the solar storms come from.

59
0:03:17.753,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They come from regions of the Sun

60
0:03:19.722,000 --> 0:03:22,000
where a tremendous amount of energy is being stored.

61
0:03:23.038,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You have an example here,

62
0:03:24.574,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as a complex structure hanging above the solar surface,

63
0:03:28.408,000 --> 0:03:3,000
just on the verge of erupting.

64
0:03:31.877,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes

65
0:03:34.787,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in the scorching hot atmosphere of the Sun,

66
0:03:38.23,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where temperatures can rise up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.

67
0:03:44.227,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So what I do is I use computer simulations

68
0:03:48.462,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in order to analyze but also to predict the behavior of these storms

69
0:03:53.319,000 --> 0:03:55,000
when they're just born at the Sun.

70
0:03:57.421,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is only one part of the story, though.

71
0:04:01.486,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When these solar storms are moving in space,

72
0:04:05.368,000 --> 0:04:08,000
some of them will inevitably encounter space probes

73
0:04:08.998,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds.

74
0:04:14.105,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What I mean by other worlds is, for example, planets,

75
0:04:16.962,000 --> 0:04:18,000
such as Venus or Mercury,

76
0:04:19.086,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but also objects, such as comets.

77
0:04:22.584,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And while these space probes have been made

78
0:04:25.194,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for different scientific endeavors,

79
0:04:27.929,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations

80
0:04:33.09,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and monitor the evolution of these space storms.

81
0:04:36.979,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I, with a group of researchers, gather and analyze this data

82
0:04:42.338,000 --> 0:04:45,000
coming from different locations of the Solar System.

83
0:04:45.411,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And by doing so, my research shows that, actually,

84
0:04:48.751,000 --> 0:04:5,000
solar storms have a generic shape,

85
0:04:50.863,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and that this shape evolves as solar storms move away from the Sun.

86
0:04:55.392,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And you know what?

87
0:04:56.571,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is key for building tools to predict space weather.

88
0:05:03.42,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I would like to leave you with this beautiful image.

89
0:05:06.529,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is us here on Earth,

90
0:05:09.692,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this pale blue dot.

91
0:05:11.736,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And while I study the Sun and its storms every day,

92
0:05:15.424,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I will always have a deep love for this beautiful planet --

93
0:05:20.076,000 --> 0:05:21,000
a pale blue dot indeed,

94
0:05:21.491,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but a pale blue dot with an invisible magnetic shield

95
0:05:25.399,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that helps to protect us.

96
0:05:27.629,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Thank you.

97
0:05:28.959,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Applause)

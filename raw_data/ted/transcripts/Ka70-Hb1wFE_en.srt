0:00:16.224,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I was 11,

3
0:00:17.664,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.

4
0:00:22.226,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My father was listening to BBC News

5
0:00:24.697,000 --> 0:00:28,000
on his small, gray radio.

6
0:00:28.871,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,

7
0:00:31.747,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because the news mostly depressed him.

8
0:00:35.718,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.

9
0:00:40.603,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I didn't know what it meant,

10
0:00:43.191,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but I could see that my father was very, very happy.

11
0:00:48.377,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"You can go to a real school now," he said.

12
0:00:56.888,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A morning that I will never forget.

13
0:01:02.057,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A real school.

14
0:01:07.225,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan

15
0:01:10.333,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and made it illegal for girls to go to school.

16
0:01:13.856,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy

17
0:01:16.964,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed

18
0:01:19.475,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to be outside alone, to a secret school.

19
0:01:24.889,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It was the only way we both could be educated.

20
0:01:29.514,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Each day, we took a different route

21
0:01:32.748,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so that no one would suspect where we were going.

22
0:01:36.771,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We would cover our books in grocery bags

23
0:01:38.965,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so it would seem we were just out shopping.

24
0:01:45.101,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The school was in a house,

25
0:01:47.477,000 --> 0:01:52,000
more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.

26
0:01:53.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.

27
0:01:58.99,000 --> 0:02:,000
We all knew we were risking our lives --

28
0:02:01.511,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the teacher, the students and our parents.

29
0:02:05.865,000 --> 0:02:07,000
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled

30
0:02:08.238,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for a week because Taliban were suspicious.

31
0:02:12.154,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We always wondered what they knew about us.

32
0:02:14.934,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Were we being followed?

33
0:02:17.966,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Do they know where we live?

34
0:02:21.498,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We were scared,

35
0:02:24.156,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but still, school was where we wanted to be.

36
0:02:31.082,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was very lucky to grow up in a family

37
0:02:34.822,000 --> 0:02:4,000
where education was prized and daughters were treasured.

38
0:02:41.069,000 --> 0:02:46,000
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.

39
0:02:46.22,000 --> 0:02:49,000
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,

40
0:02:49.699,000 --> 0:02:52,000
he insisted that his daughter, my mom,

41
0:02:53.195,000 --> 0:02:59,000
go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.

42
0:02:59.608,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But my educated mother became a teacher.

43
0:03:03.118,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There she is.

44
0:03:06.144,000 --> 0:03:08,000
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house

45
0:03:08.811,000 --> 0:03:13,000
into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.

46
0:03:14.189,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And my father -- that's him --

47
0:03:18.577,000 --> 0:03:24,000
he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.

48
0:03:25.478,000 --> 0:03:27,000
There was no question that his children

49
0:03:27.587,000 --> 0:03:32,000
would receive an education, including his daughters,

50
0:03:32.676,000 --> 0:03:36,000
despite the Taliban, despite the risks.

51
0:03:37.096,000 --> 0:03:45,000
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.

52
0:03:45.442,000 --> 0:03:48,000
During Taliban years, I remember

53
0:03:48.57,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there were times I would get so frustrated by our life

54
0:03:53.663,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and always being scared and not seeing a future.

55
0:03:57.615,000 --> 0:04:,000
I would want to quit,

56
0:04:00.669,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but my father,

57
0:04:03.805,000 --> 0:04:05,000
he would say,

58
0:04:06.314,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Listen, my daughter,

59
0:04:08.419,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you can lose everything you own in your life.

60
0:04:11.735,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.

61
0:04:15.94,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But the one thing that will always remain with you

62
0:04:18.721,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is what is here,

63
0:04:22.029,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,

64
0:04:26.945,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we will.

65
0:04:30.166,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So do you still not want to continue?"

66
0:04:35.248,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Today I am 22.

67
0:04:38.376,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed

68
0:04:41.146,000 --> 0:04:44,000
by decades of war.

69
0:04:44.316,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,

70
0:04:49.457,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and had my family not been so committed to my education,

71
0:04:51.922,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I would be one of them.

72
0:04:54.526,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.

73
0:04:59.841,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Applause)

74
0:05:09.854,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,

75
0:05:12.802,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,

76
0:05:17.381,000 --> 0:05:2,000
was among the first to congratulate me.

77
0:05:20.875,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He not only brags about my college degree,

78
0:05:23.505,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but also that I was the first woman,

79
0:05:25.714,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and that I am the first woman

80
0:05:27.436,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to drive him through the streets of Kabul.

81
0:05:30.938,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

82
0:05:36.3,000 --> 0:05:38,000
My family believes in me.

83
0:05:38.949,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.

84
0:05:43.899,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,

85
0:05:48.366,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a global campaign to educate women.

86
0:05:51.13,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's why I cofounded SOLA,

87
0:05:53.709,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the first and perhaps only boarding school

88
0:05:56.176,000 --> 0:05:57,000
for girls in Afghanistan,

89
0:05:57.905,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.

90
0:06:03.542,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school

91
0:06:07.307,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with ambition grabbing at opportunity.

92
0:06:12.935,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I see their parents and their fathers

93
0:06:15.862,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who, like my own, advocate for them,

94
0:06:20.44,000 --> 0:06:28,000
despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.

95
0:06:29.372,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,

96
0:06:32.078,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and I cannot show you his face,

97
0:06:34.706,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.

98
0:06:38.351,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter

99
0:06:42.187,000 --> 0:06:45,000
were on their way from SOLA to their village,

100
0:06:45.521,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and they literally missed being killed

101
0:06:52.014,000 --> 0:06:56,000
by a roadside bomb by minutes.

102
0:06:56.796,000 --> 0:06:59,000
As he arrived home, the phone rang,

103
0:07:00.199,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a voice warning him

104
0:07:02.894,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that if he sent his daughter back to school,

105
0:07:06.289,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they would try again.

106
0:07:09.066,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,

107
0:07:12.968,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"but I will not ruin my daughter's future

108
0:07:16.862,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because of your old and backward ideas."

109
0:07:21.694,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,

110
0:07:24.063,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,

111
0:07:27.583,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that behind most of us who succeed

112
0:07:30.806,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter

113
0:07:38.169,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and who sees that her success is his success.

114
0:07:42.796,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.

115
0:07:46.734,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators

116
0:07:51.27,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of a bright future for their daughters,

117
0:07:54.61,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,

118
0:07:58.021,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we must have the support of men.

119
0:08:01.441,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school

120
0:08:04.991,000 --> 0:08:05,000
numbered in the hundreds --

121
0:08:06.783,000 --> 0:08:08,000
remember, it was illegal.

122
0:08:09.121,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.

123
0:08:14.613,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

124
0:08:21.86,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.

125
0:08:28.011,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.

126
0:08:32.983,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I fear that these changes will not last

127
0:08:36.033,000 --> 0:08:4,000
much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.

128
0:08:40.525,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But when I am back in Afghanistan,

129
0:08:44.178,000 --> 0:08:48,000
when I see the students in my school

130
0:08:48.963,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and their parents who advocate for them,

131
0:08:51.603,000 --> 0:08:55,000
who encourage them, I see a promising future

132
0:08:56.07,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and lasting change.

133
0:08:59.37,000 --> 0:09:07,000
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,

134
0:09:07.837,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and every single day

135
0:09:11.249,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the girls of SOLA remind me of that.

136
0:09:14.657,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Like me, they are dreaming big.

137
0:09:17.864,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you.

138
0:09:19.575,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

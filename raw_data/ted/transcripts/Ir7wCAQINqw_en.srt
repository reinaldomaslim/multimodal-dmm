0:00:12.937,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In the future,

3
0:00:14.136,000 --> 0:00:17,000
self-driving cars will be safer and more reliable than humans.

4
0:00:18.175,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But for this to happen,

5
0:00:19.421,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we need technologies that allow cars to respond

6
0:00:22.175,000 --> 0:00:23,000
faster than humans,

7
0:00:23.466,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we need algorithms that can drive better than humans

8
0:00:27.204,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and we need cameras that can see more than humans can see.

9
0:00:32.061,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For example, imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn,

10
0:00:36.815,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and there's an oncoming car

11
0:00:38.173,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street.

12
0:00:41.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Fortunately, our future car will have this superpower,

13
0:00:45.046,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards.

14
0:00:49.876,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For the past few years as a PhD student

15
0:00:51.979,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab,

16
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I've been working on a camera that can do just this --

17
0:00:57.058,000 --> 0:01:,000
a camera that can image objects hidden around corners

18
0:01:00.48,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or blocked from direct line of sight.

19
0:01:03.276,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So let me give you an example of what our camera can see.

20
0:01:06.752,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is an outdoor experiment we conducted

21
0:01:09.339,000 --> 0:01:12,000
where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with a laser,

22
0:01:13.173,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and the scene that we want to capture

23
0:01:15.157,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is hidden around the corner behind this curtain.

24
0:01:18.141,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So our camera system can't actually see it directly.

25
0:01:21.561,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And yet, somehow,

26
0:01:22.753,000 --> 0:01:26,000
our camera can still capture the 3D geometry of this scene.

27
0:01:27.704,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So how do we do this?

28
0:01:29.498,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The magic happens here in this camera system.

29
0:01:32.244,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You can think of this as a type of high-speed camera.

30
0:01:35.593,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Not one that operates at 1,000 frames per second,

31
0:01:39.087,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or even a million frames per second,

32
0:01:41.856,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but a trillion frames per second.

33
0:01:45.023,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So fast that it can actually capture the movement of light itself.

34
0:01:50.652,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And to give you an example of just how fast light travels,

35
0:01:54.319,000 --> 0:01:58,000
let's compare it to the speed of a fast-running comic book superhero

36
0:01:58.628,000 --> 0:02:,000
who can move at up to three times the speed of sound.

37
0:02:02.201,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It takes a pulse of light about 3.3 billionths of a second,

38
0:02:06.424,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or 3.3 nanoseconds,

39
0:02:08.321,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to travel the distance of a meter.

40
0:02:10.474,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, in that same time,

41
0:02:12.433,000 --> 0:02:15,000
our superhero has moved less than the width of a human hair.

42
0:02:16.633,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's pretty fast.

43
0:02:18.306,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But actually, we need to image much faster

44
0:02:20.784,000 --> 0:02:23,000
if we want to capture light moving at subcentimeter scales.

45
0:02:24.784,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So our camera system can capture photons

46
0:02:27.305,000 --> 0:02:3,000
at time frames of just 50 trillionths of a second,

47
0:02:30.845,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or 50 picoseconds.

48
0:02:33.821,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So we take this ultra-high-speed camera

49
0:02:36.347,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we pair it with a laser that sends out short pulses of light.

50
0:02:40.553,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Each pulse travels to this visible wall

51
0:02:43.212,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and some light scatters back to our camera,

52
0:02:45.363,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner

53
0:02:48.603,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to the hidden object and back.

54
0:02:51.363,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We repeat this measurement many times

55
0:02:53.625,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to capture the arrival times of many photons

56
0:02:56.189,000 --> 0:02:58,000
from different locations on the wall.

57
0:02:58.3,000 --> 0:03:,000
And after we capture these measurements, we can create

58
0:03:01.18,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a trillion-frame-per-second video of the wall.

59
0:03:04.371,000 --> 0:03:07,000
While this wall may look ordinary to our own eyes,

60
0:03:07.403,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at a trillion frames per second, we can see something truly incredible.

61
0:03:12.275,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We can actually see waves of light scattered back from the hidden scene

62
0:03:16.666,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and splashing against the wall.

63
0:03:19.063,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And each of these waves carries information

64
0:03:22.039,000 --> 0:03:24,000
about the hidden object that sent it.

65
0:03:24.341,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we can take these measurements

66
0:03:26.046,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and pass them into a reconstruction algorithm

67
0:03:28.569,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to then recover the 3D geometry of this hidden scene.

68
0:03:33.379,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now I want to show you one more example of an indoor scene that we captured,

69
0:03:37.213,000 --> 0:03:4,000
this time with a variety of different hidden objects.

70
0:03:40.347,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And these objects have different appearances,

71
0:03:42.498,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so they reflect light differently.

72
0:03:44.355,000 --> 0:03:47,000
For example, this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently

73
0:03:48.133,000 --> 0:03:49,000
than the mirror disco ball

74
0:03:49.934,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or the white discus thrower statue.

75
0:03:52.998,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we can actually see the differences in the reflected light

76
0:03:56.441,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by visualizing it as this 3D volume,

77
0:03:59.306,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where we've just taken the video frames and stacked them together.

78
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And time here is represented as the depth dimension of this cube.

79
0:04:07.914,000 --> 0:04:1,000
These bright dots that you see are reflections of light

80
0:04:11.129,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball,

81
0:04:13.699,000 --> 0:04:15,000
scattering against the wall over time.

82
0:04:16.422,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time

83
0:04:19.982,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall,

84
0:04:23.966,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the other streaks of light come from reflections of light from the bookcase

85
0:04:27.791,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and from the statue.

86
0:04:29.727,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, we can also visualize these measurements frame by frame,

87
0:04:33.638,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as a video,

88
0:04:34.854,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to directly see the scattered light.

89
0:04:37.461,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And again, here we see, first, reflections of light from the dragon,

90
0:04:41.104,000 --> 0:04:42,000
closest to the wall,

91
0:04:42.374,000 --> 0:04:45,000
followed by bright dots from the disco ball

92
0:04:45.787,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and other reflections from the bookcase.

93
0:04:48.53,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And finally, we see the reflected waves of light from the statue.

94
0:04:53.84,000 --> 0:04:55,000
These waves of light illuminating the wall

95
0:04:56.657,000 --> 0:05:,000
are like fireworks that last for just trillionths of a second.

96
0:05:05.649,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And even though these objects reflect light differently,

97
0:05:08.919,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we can still reconstruct their shapes.

98
0:05:11.577,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And this is what you can see from around the corner.

99
0:05:15.547,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, I want to show you one more example that's slightly different.

100
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In this video, you see me dressed in this reflective suit

101
0:05:22.404,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of four times every second.

102
0:05:27.173,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The suit is reflective,

103
0:05:28.411,000 --> 0:05:3,000
so we can actually capture enough photons

104
0:05:31.093,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that we can see where I am and what I'm doing,

105
0:05:34.665,000 --> 0:05:36,000
without the camera actually directly imaging me.

106
0:05:37.586,000 --> 0:05:41,000
By capturing photons that scatter from the wall to my tracksuit,

107
0:05:42.149,000 --> 0:05:44,000
back to the wall and back to the camera,

108
0:05:44.307,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we can capture this indirect video in real time.

109
0:05:48.954,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And we think that this type of practical non-line-of-sight imaging

110
0:05:52.184,000 --> 0:05:55,000
could be useful for applications including for self-driving cars,

111
0:05:55.934,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but also for biomedical imaging,

112
0:05:58.053,000 --> 0:06:01,000
where we need to see into the tiny structures of the body.

113
0:06:01.974,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots

114
0:06:05.499,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that we send to explore other planets.

115
0:06:08.839,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now you may have heard about seeing around corners before,

116
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but what I showed you today would have been impossible

117
0:06:14.223,000 --> 0:06:15,000
just two years ago.

118
0:06:15.411,000 --> 0:06:18,000
For example, we can now image large, room-sized hidden scenes outdoors

119
0:06:19.292,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and at real-time rates,

120
0:06:21.165,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and we've made significant advancements towards making this a practical technology

121
0:06:25.546,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that you could actually see on a car someday.

122
0:06:28.156,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But of course, there's still challenges remaining.

123
0:06:30.76,000 --> 0:06:34,000
For example, can we image hidden scenes at long distances

124
0:06:34.847,000 --> 0:06:37,000
where we're collecting very, very few photons,

125
0:06:38.014,000 --> 0:06:41,000
with lasers that are low-power and that are eye-safe.

126
0:06:41.641,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Or can we create images from photons

127
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that have scattered around many more times

128
0:06:46.053,000 --> 0:06:48,000
than just a single bounce around the corner?

129
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Can we take our prototype system that's, well, currently large and bulky,

130
0:06:53.347,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and miniaturize it into something that could be useful

131
0:06:55.911,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for biomedical imaging

132
0:06:57.134,000 --> 0:07:,000
or perhaps a sort of improved home-security system,

133
0:07:00.244,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or can we take this new imaging modality and use it for other applications?

134
0:07:05.78,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I think it's an exciting new technology

135
0:07:07.693,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and there could be other things that we haven't thought of yet

136
0:07:10.645,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to use it for.

137
0:07:11.843,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And so, well, a future with self-driving cars

138
0:07:14.412,000 --> 0:07:16,000
may seem distant to us now --

139
0:07:16.602,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we're already developing the technologies

140
0:07:18.603,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that could make cars safer and more intelligent.

141
0:07:21.698,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And with the rapid pace of scientific discovery and innovation,

142
0:07:25.024,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you never know what new and exciting capabilities

143
0:07:28.095,000 --> 0:07:3,000
could be just around the corner.

144
0:07:30.81,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.86,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Banjo plays)

2
0:00:25.123,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Banjo and guitar play)

3
0:00:33.965,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Sings) Is this what it's like

4
0:00:37.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to be alive?

5
0:00:39.382,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I reached the point of no return

6
0:00:42.007,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I don't know if I've been burned

7
0:00:44.67,000 --> 0:00:46,000
from the burned bridges in my life,

8
0:00:47.5,000 --> 0:00:48,000
thinkin' you were wrong

9
0:00:48.702,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I was right.

10
0:00:49.891,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Maybe I messed up,

11
0:00:52.544,000 --> 0:00:54,000
either way it's too late for us.

12
0:00:54.758,000 --> 0:00:56,000
'Cause baby I'm old with regret,

13
0:00:57.593,000 --> 0:00:59,000
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

14
0:01:00.088,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,

15
0:01:02.954,000 --> 0:01:05,000
wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.

16
0:01:06.22,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

17
0:01:08.512,000 --> 0:01:1,000
wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.

18
0:01:10.964,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.

19
0:01:15.03,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

20
0:01:17.913,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Gone, gone, gone.

21
0:01:25.589,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

22
0:01:28.589,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Gone, gone, gone.

23
0:01:36.255,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

24
0:01:38.503,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Is this what it's like to fantasize

25
0:01:43.903,000 --> 0:01:48,000
about a love that never was alive outside my mind or distance?

26
0:01:49.683,000 --> 0:01:51,000
With time I clearly lost my sight,

27
0:01:51.965,000 --> 0:01:53,000
thinkin' I was wrong to ever leave your side.

28
0:01:54.315,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But time's the harshest judge,

29
0:01:56.951,000 --> 0:01:58,000
makes us think we were in love.

30
0:01:59.042,000 --> 0:02:,000
And now

31
0:02:00.222,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm old with regret,

32
0:02:01.766,000 --> 0:02:03,000
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

33
0:02:04.468,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,

34
0:02:07.229,000 --> 0:02:1,000
wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.

35
0:02:10.297,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

36
0:02:12.754,000 --> 0:02:14,000
wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.

37
0:02:15.026,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.

38
0:02:19.284,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

39
0:02:22.031,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Gone, gone, gone.

40
0:02:29.824,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

41
0:02:32.707,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Banjo and guitar play)

42
0:02:52.933,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And baby I'm old with regret,

43
0:02:55.063,000 --> 0:02:57,000
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

44
0:02:57.579,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,

45
0:03:00.471,000 --> 0:03:03,000
wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.

46
0:03:03.614,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

47
0:03:05.934,000 --> 0:03:07,000
wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.

48
0:03:08.229,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.

49
0:03:12.52,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

50
0:03:15.357,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Gone, gone, gone.

51
0:03:23.002,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

52
0:03:25.916,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Gone, gone, gone.

53
0:03:33.74,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

54
0:03:35.802,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Is this what it's like?

1
0:00:12.601,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm an artist and I cut books.

2
0:00:14.61,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is one of my first book works.

3
0:00:16.316,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's called "Alternate Route to Knowledge."

4
0:00:18.34,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery

5
0:00:22.132,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books,

6
0:00:24.952,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it,

7
0:00:28.441,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and wonder what was happening, wonder why,

8
0:00:30.417,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and think about the material of the book.

9
0:00:32.453,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So I'm interested in the texture,

10
0:00:34.543,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books.

11
0:00:39.623,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In most of my work, what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish

12
0:00:43.524,000 --> 0:00:45,000
so it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book

13
0:00:46.334,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so it becomes a solid material, but then the pages inside are still loose,

14
0:00:50.202,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and then I carve into the surface of the book,

15
0:00:52.352,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I'm not moving or adding anything.

16
0:00:54.883,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm just carving around whatever I find interesting.

17
0:00:57.762,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So everything you see within the finished piece

18
0:01:00.223,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is exactly where it was in the book before I began.

19
0:01:04.666,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I think of my work as sort of a remix, in a way,

20
0:01:07.014,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because I'm working with somebody else's material

21
0:01:09.345,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music.

22
0:01:12.973,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This was a book of Raphael paintings, the Renaissance artist,

23
0:01:16.918,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and by taking his work and remixing it, carving into it,

24
0:01:21.353,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary.

25
0:01:25.915,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book

26
0:01:29.781,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and pushing that linear format,

27
0:01:31.917,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and try to push the structure of the book itself

28
0:01:35.9,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so that the book can become fully sculptural.

29
0:01:41.303,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials, weights,

30
0:01:45.068,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in order to hold things in place before I varnish

31
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so that I can push the form before I begin,

32
0:01:50.6,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so that something like this can become a piece like this,

33
0:01:55.242,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which is just made from a single dictionary.

34
0:01:58.13,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Or something like this can become a piece like this.

35
0:02:06.768,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Or something like this,

36
0:02:08.244,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio,

37
0:02:12.255,000 --> 0:02:16,000
will become a piece like this.

38
0:02:16.997,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books,

39
0:02:20.685,000 --> 0:02:21,000
people don't want to rip books

40
0:02:22.228,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and nobody really wants to throw away a book,

41
0:02:24.359,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is that we think about books as living things,

42
0:02:26.552,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we think about them as a body,

43
0:02:28.223,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they're created to relate to our body, as far as scale,

44
0:02:31.313,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but they also have the potential to continue to grow

45
0:02:33.741,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and to continue to become new things.

46
0:02:35.731,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So books really are alive.

47
0:02:38.458,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I think of the book as a body,

48
0:02:40.988,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I think of the book as a technology.

49
0:02:43.692,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I think of the book as a tool.

50
0:02:48.111,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I also think of the book as a machine.

51
0:02:52.435,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I also think of the book as a landscape.

52
0:02:54.809,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together,

53
0:02:59.081,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and as I carve through it,

54
0:03:01.334,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm deciding what I want to choose.

55
0:03:03.275,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So with encyclopedias, I could have chosen anything,

56
0:03:05.863,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but I specifically chose images of landscapes.

57
0:03:10.03,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And with the material itself, I'm using sandpaper

58
0:03:12.966,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape,

59
0:03:16.658,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but the material itself suggests a landscape as well.

60
0:03:21.456,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book,

61
0:03:24.889,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I'm thinking about images, but I'm also thinking about text,

62
0:03:28.57,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and I think about them in a very similar way,

63
0:03:30.775,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because what's interesting is that when we're reading text,

64
0:03:33.647,000 --> 0:03:34,000
when we're reading a book,

65
0:03:35.146,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it puts images in our head,

66
0:03:36.615,000 --> 0:03:38,000
so we're sort of filling that piece.

67
0:03:38.638,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're sort of creating images when we're reading text,

68
0:03:42.039,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and when we're looking at an image, we actually use language

69
0:03:44.916,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in order to understand what we're looking at.

70
0:03:47.632,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So there's sort of a yin-yang that happens,

71
0:03:49.861,000 --> 0:03:5,000
sort of a flip flop.

72
0:03:51.138,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves.

73
0:03:57.477,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I think of my work as almost an archaeology.

74
0:04:00.96,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential

75
0:04:03.979,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and discover as much as I possibly can

76
0:04:06.068,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and exposing it within my own work.

77
0:04:10.219,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But at the same time,

78
0:04:11.896,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,

79
0:04:13.87,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and what's happening now that most of our information is intangible,

80
0:04:18.351,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and this idea of loss,

81
0:04:21.393,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers,

82
0:04:25.711,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but the information itself,

83
0:04:28.033,000 --> 0:04:3,000
now that we don't have a physical backup,

84
0:04:30.262,000 --> 0:04:35,000
has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it.

85
0:04:35.843,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I have several dictionaries in my own studio,

86
0:04:38.623,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I do use a computer every day,

87
0:04:41.14,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and if I need to look up a word, I'll go on the computer,

88
0:04:43.933,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up.

89
0:04:47.259,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I think that the book was never really

90
0:04:49.209,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the right format for nonlinear information,

91
0:04:52.204,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is why we're seeing reference books

92
0:04:54.278,000 --> 0:04:57,000
becoming the first to be endangered or extinct.

93
0:05:01.743,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I don't think that the book will ever really die.

94
0:05:04.51,000 --> 0:05:08,000
People think that now that we have digital technology,

95
0:05:08.806,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the book is going to die,

96
0:05:10.178,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving.

97
0:05:13.381,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I think that the book will evolve,

98
0:05:15.505,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and just like people said painting would die

99
0:05:18.767,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when photography and printmaking became everyday materials,

100
0:05:23.167,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but what it really allowed painting to do

101
0:05:25.154,000 --> 0:05:27,000
was it allowed painting to quit its day job.

102
0:05:27.706,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story,

103
0:05:34.022,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story,

104
0:05:37.435,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,

105
0:05:39.512,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and we saw painting go into different branches.

106
0:05:41.754,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I think that's what's happening with books now,

107
0:05:44.238,000 --> 0:05:46,000
now that most of our technology, most of our information,

108
0:05:46.933,000 --> 0:05:5,000
most of our personal and cultural records are in digital form,

109
0:05:51.127,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I think it's really allowing the book to become something new.

110
0:05:54.079,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me,

111
0:05:56.869,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future.

112
0:06:00.439,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Thank you.

113
0:06:01.768,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.811,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi, I'm Jack,

2
0:00:14.509,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and I'm transgender.

3
0:00:17.232,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts

4
0:00:19.114,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that might be running through your head right now.

5
0:00:21.472,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Transgender?

6
0:00:22.646,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Wait, does that mean that they're actually a man or actually a woman?"

7
0:00:25.988,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"I wonder if he's had the surgery yet ...

8
0:00:28.656,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch.

9
0:00:30.323,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Look to the right, that's a safe place to look."

10
0:00:32.682,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Yes, I knew it! No real man has hips like those."

11
0:00:35.077,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"My friend's daughter is transgender --

12
0:00:36.997,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I wonder if they know each other."

13
0:00:39.155,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Oh my gosh, he is so brave.

14
0:00:41.99,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I would totally support his right to use the men's bathroom.

15
0:00:44.895,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?

16
0:00:46.832,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How does he have sex?"

17
0:00:48.014,000 --> 0:00:5,000
OK, OK, let's stop those hypothetical questions

18
0:00:51.034,000 --> 0:00:52,000
before we get too close for my comfort.

19
0:00:52.958,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I mean, don't get me wrong,

20
0:00:54.283,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I did come here today to share my personal experiences being transgender,

21
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
but I did not wake up this morning wanting to tell an entire audience

22
0:01:01.706,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about my sex life.

23
0:01:03.398,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Of course, that's the problem with being trans, right?

24
0:01:06.051,000 --> 0:01:08,000
People are pretty much always wondering how we have sex

25
0:01:08.821,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and what kind of equipment we're working with below the belt.

26
0:01:12.318,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Being trans is awkward.

27
0:01:15.18,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And not just because the gender I was assigned at birth

28
0:01:17.776,000 --> 0:01:18,000
mismatches the one I really am.

29
0:01:19.498,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Being trans is awkward

30
0:01:20.825,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because everyone else gets awkward when they're around me.

31
0:01:24.512,000 --> 0:01:27,000
People who support me and all other trans people wholeheartedly

32
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are often so scared to say to wrong thing,

33
0:01:30.527,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so embarrassed to not know what they think they should,

34
0:01:33.131,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that they never ask.

35
0:01:35.263,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Part of what was so nerve-racking about coming out as transgender

36
0:01:38.568,000 --> 0:01:41,000
was knowing that people wouldn't know what I meant.

37
0:01:42.198,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And when someone comes out as gay,

38
0:01:43.842,000 --> 0:01:44,000
people know what that means,

39
0:01:45.227,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but when you come out as trans,

40
0:01:46.796,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you have to face the misconceptions

41
0:01:48.488,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that will color other people's impressions of you

42
0:01:51.012,000 --> 0:01:52,000
even after you've educated them ...

43
0:01:53.376,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And you will have to educate them.

44
0:01:55.693,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When I came out,

45
0:01:56.867,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document

46
0:01:58.876,000 --> 0:02:,000
with a zip-file attachment of music and videos

47
0:02:01.392,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I sent to every single person I came out to.

48
0:02:03.731,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:04.841,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And I kept it in my email signature for months afterwards,

50
0:02:07.625,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because you also don't ever stop coming out.

51
0:02:10.109,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I came out to the accountant helping me with my taxes

52
0:02:14.07,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the TSA agents who didn't know which one of them should pat me down,

53
0:02:17.785,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the man or the woman.

54
0:02:19.902,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I mean, I just came out to everyone watching this.

55
0:02:23.665,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When I came out to my dad,

56
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to my great relief, he was totally cool with me being trans,

57
0:02:28.538,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but as soon as I started talking about physically transitioning,

58
0:02:31.808,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he freaked.

59
0:02:32.998,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I quickly realized it was because he, like so many other people,

60
0:02:36.299,000 --> 0:02:39,000
think that physical transition means just one thing:

61
0:02:39.749,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the surgery.

62
0:02:41.466,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, listen,

63
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if there were one magical surgery

64
0:02:44.467,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that could turn me into a tall, muscular,

65
0:02:47.34,000 --> 0:02:49,000
societally perfect image of a man overnight,

66
0:02:50.135,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'd sign up in a heartbeat.

67
0:02:52.228,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.

68
0:02:54.502,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There are dozens of different gender-affirming surgeries

69
0:02:57.505,000 --> 0:02:59,000
from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries

70
0:03:00.304,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to facial feminization and man-sculpting.

71
0:03:03.263,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Many trans people will only ever undergo one procedure in their lifetime, if that.

72
0:03:07.804,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Maybe because they don't personally feel the need

73
0:03:10.164,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but also because they're expensive,

74
0:03:12.507,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and health insurance is only beginning to cover them.

75
0:03:15.62,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Instead, the first step for a trans person seeking physical transition

76
0:03:19.414,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is usually hormone replacement therapy.

77
0:03:22.022,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice and some sparse whiskers on my neck

78
0:03:26.309,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and a giant pimple on my chin.

79
0:03:29.461,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Basically, they put you through a second puberty ...

80
0:03:32.208,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it's a blast.

81
0:03:33.469,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:34.602,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, because our transitions are slower and steadier

83
0:03:38.263,000 --> 0:03:4,000
than historic misconceptions can lead people to believe,

84
0:03:40.923,000 --> 0:03:41,000
there can be some confusion

85
0:03:42.242,000 --> 0:03:45,000
about when to call someone by their new name and pronouns.

86
0:03:45.302,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There's no distinct point in physical transition

87
0:03:48.131,000 --> 0:03:51,000
at which a trans person becomes their true gender.

88
0:03:51.234,000 --> 0:03:53,000
As soon as they tell you their new name and pronouns,

89
0:03:53.743,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that's when you start using them.

90
0:03:55.735,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It can be difficult to make the change.

91
0:03:57.799,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You might slip up here and there;

92
0:03:59.504,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I've slipped up myself with other trans people.

93
0:04:01.878,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But I always think to myself,

94
0:04:03.304,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if we can change from calling Puff Daddy to P. Diddy,

95
0:04:06.822,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and if we apologize profusely when we've used the wrong gender pronoun

96
0:04:10.91,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for someone's pet cat --

97
0:04:13.005,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I mean, I think we can make the same effort

98
0:04:15.039,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for the real humans in our lives.

99
0:04:17.143,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, there is no topic that makes other people more awkward about trans people

100
0:04:22.589,000 --> 0:04:23,000
than public bathrooms.

101
0:04:25.006,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Ah, the bathrooms --

102
0:04:26.333,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the latest political flash point for LGBT opponents.

103
0:04:29.308,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms:

104
0:04:31.471,000 --> 0:04:35,000
more US congressmen have been convicted of assaulting someone in a public bathroom

105
0:04:35.794,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than trans people have been.

106
0:04:37.368,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:39.495,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The truth is we trans people are so much more scared of you than you are of us.

108
0:04:43.632,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's a huge point of discussion in trans communities

109
0:04:46.086,000 --> 0:04:48,000
about which bathroom to start using and when,

110
0:04:48.258,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so we don't attract attention that could lead to violence against us.

111
0:04:51.618,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I personally started using the men's room

112
0:04:53.618,000 --> 0:04:57,000
when I started getting confused and frightened looks in the women's room,

113
0:04:58.031,000 --> 0:05:,000
even though I was petrified to start going into the men's room.

114
0:05:01.039,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And often we opt to just not go to the bathroom at all.

115
0:05:03.799,000 --> 0:05:05,000
A 2015 national survey of trans people

116
0:05:06.267,000 --> 0:05:09,000
found that eight percent of us had had a urinary tract infection

117
0:05:09.422,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in the past year

118
0:05:10.677,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as a result of avoiding restrooms.

119
0:05:13.48,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These bathroom bills aren't protecting anyone.

120
0:05:16.724,000 --> 0:05:17,000
All they're doing

121
0:05:17.906,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is ensuring that when trans people are assaulted in bathrooms,

122
0:05:21.25,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the law will no longer be on our side when we report it.

123
0:05:25.169,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Being trans means a daily onslaught of these misconceptions.

124
0:05:31.334,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I have it pretty easy.

125
0:05:33.071,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I am a white, able-bodied guy

126
0:05:35.239,000 --> 0:05:38,000
sitting nearly at the peak of privilege mountain.

127
0:05:39.382,000 --> 0:05:4,000
For non-binary people,

128
0:05:41.433,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for trans women,

129
0:05:43.081,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for trans people of color,

130
0:05:45.137,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it is so much harder.

131
0:05:48.903,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I've given you a starter pack of trans knowledge

132
0:05:51.73,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that I hope will lead to more learning on your own.

133
0:05:55.608,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Talk to trans people.

134
0:05:57.653,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Listen to us.

135
0:05:59.587,000 --> 0:06:,000
Amplify our voices.

136
0:06:01.934,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Take the heat off of us and educate those around you

137
0:06:04.403,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so we don't have to every time.

138
0:06:06.957,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Maybe someday, when I say,

139
0:06:09.144,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender,"

140
0:06:12.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the only response I'll get is,

141
0:06:14.617,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Hi, nice to meet you."

142
0:06:18.256,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Thank you.

143
0:06:19.431,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

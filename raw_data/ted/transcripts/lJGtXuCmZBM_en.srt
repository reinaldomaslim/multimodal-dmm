1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about two years ago.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was in the desert, under the starry skies

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And we were in conversation

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
about how nothing had changed

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now we do the same with airplanes.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Back then,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now we do the same

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with drills and machines.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The conclusion that we came to

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
was that magic had been replaced

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
by machinery.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And this made me really sad.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was terrified by this idea

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that I would lose the ability

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to enjoy and appreciate the sunset

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And it felt like technology

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
should enable magic, not kill it.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When I was a little girl,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And this piece of 50-year-old technology

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
became the most magical thing to me.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It became a gilded gateway

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and images in my imagination.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I felt like our cellphones

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and our fancy watches and our cameras

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
had stopped us from dreaming.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They stopped us from being inspired.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to see how I could use it to enable magic

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as opposed to kill it.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And so when I saw the iPad,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I saw it as a storytelling device

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that could connect readers all over the world.

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It can know how we're holding it.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It can know where we are.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It brings together image and text

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and animation and sound and touch.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Storytelling is becoming

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
more and more multi-sensorial.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But what are we doing with it?

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
an interactive app for the iPad.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So it says, "Place your fingers

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
upon each light."

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And so --

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Music)

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It says, "This box belongs to ... "

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And so I type in my name.

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And actually I become a character in the book.

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
At various points, a little letter drops down to me --

63
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which is actually addressed to me.

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The child in me is really excited

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
by these kinds of possibilities.

67
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.

68
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I don't mean wizards and dragons,

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I mean the kind of childhood magic,

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
those ideas that we all harbored as children.

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was always really exciting to me.

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
take the fireflies out.

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
was that an entire galaxy could be contained

78
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
within a single marble.

79
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And so over here,

80
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
each book and each world

81
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
becomes a little marble

82
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that I drag in

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to this magical device within the device.

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And it opens up a map.

85
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but these maps have been static.

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is a map that grows and glows

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.

90
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So I'm just going to enter in.

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Another thing that's actually really important to me

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is creating content that is Indian

93
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and yet very contemporary.

94
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Over here, these are the Apsaras.

95
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,

96
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but how many people outside of India

97
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years

99
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in an old and musty book.

100
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And so we're bringing them back

101
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in a contemporary story for children.

102
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And a story that actually deals with new issues

103
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like the environmental crisis.

104
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Music)

105
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Speaking of the environmental crisis,

106
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years

107
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is that children have been locked inside their rooms,

108
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.

109
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But now with mobile technology,

110
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we can actually take our children outside into the natural world

111
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with their technology.

112
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One of the interactions in the book

113
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is that you're sent off on this quest

114
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
where you need to go outside,

115
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
take out your camera on the iPad

116
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and collect pictures of different natural objects.

117
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When I was a child, I had multiple collections

118
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.

119
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.

120
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So in bringing back this childhood ritual,

121
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you need to go out

122
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower

123
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and then tag it.

124
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark

125
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then tag that.

126
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And what happens

127
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs

128
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that you can then put up online.

129
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox

130
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."

132
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And it creates this kind of social network

133
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
around a collection of digital photographs

134
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that you've actually taken.

135
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
In the possibilities of linking together

136
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
magic, the earth and technology,

137
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there are multiple possibilities.

138
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction

139
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
where you take your iPad out with the video on

140
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and through augmented reality,

141
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
you see this layer of animated pixies

142
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.

143
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.

144
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away

145
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and read the rest of the book.

146
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We're moving, we're all moving here,

147
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to a world where the forces of nature

148
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
come closer together to technology,

149
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and magic and technology can come closer together.

150
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We're harnessing energy from the sun.

151
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We're bringing our children and ourselves

152
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
closer to the natural world

153
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and that magic and joy

154
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and childhood love that we had

155
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
through the simple medium of a story.

156
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Thank you.

157
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

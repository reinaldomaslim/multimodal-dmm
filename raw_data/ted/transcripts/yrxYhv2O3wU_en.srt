Corey Hajim: Are you there? Ray Dalio: Hi.

3
0:00:14.968,000 --> 0:00:16,000
CH: Thank you so much for being here, Ray.

4
0:00:17.072,000 --> 0:00:19,000
RD: Do you see me? CH: I see you.

5
0:00:19.469,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You look great.

6
0:00:20.667,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Thank you so much for being here, we really appreciate it.

7
0:00:23.747,000 --> 0:00:24,000
RD: My pleasure.

8
0:00:25.192,000 --> 0:00:27,000
CH: OK, so lay it on us, Ray,

9
0:00:27.356,000 --> 0:00:29,000
how bad is it, how worried should we be?

10
0:00:32.126,000 --> 0:00:35,000
RD: Well, I think you could look at this like a tsunami that's hit --

11
0:00:35.861,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the virus itself and the social distancing.

12
0:00:38.106,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And then what are the consequences in terms of the wreckage,

13
0:00:42.108,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when you look at it?

14
0:00:44.083,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I think you have to think of that as incomes and balance sheets,

15
0:00:50.54,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you know?

16
0:00:52.35,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So it was a tremendous income hit.

17
0:00:54.634,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And then the balance sheets losses.

18
0:00:58.815,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And who has what savings and so on.

19
0:01:02.609,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And then how is that dealt with.

20
0:01:05.95,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In order to understand that,

21
0:01:08.126,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you have to realize that there are these holes.

22
0:01:10.974,000 --> 0:01:12,000
These holes in income,

23
0:01:13.212,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the holes in the balance sheets.

24
0:01:15.506,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And then you have to realize

25
0:01:17.514,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that there is the production of money and credit.

26
0:01:21.141,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And who produces that money and credit.

27
0:01:23.99,000 --> 0:01:26,000
OK, the money and credit comes in different flavors.

28
0:01:27.577,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There is US dollar money and credit.

29
0:01:30.331,000 --> 0:01:33,000
There is Euro-dollar money and credit.

30
0:01:33.885,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so when you look at the world,

31
0:01:36.123,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and you're seeing it,

32
0:01:37.37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you're seeing a situation that is the same

33
0:01:40.298,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as existed, really, in the 1930 to '45 period,

34
0:01:45.116,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in that now we're seeing the production of a lot of debt,

35
0:01:51.152,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a lot of borrowing by the government.

36
0:01:53.346,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We're seeing zero interest rates

37
0:01:55.157,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and not the traditional kind of monetary policy.

38
0:01:58.466,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But the producing of a lot of money and credit --

39
0:02:02.349,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so the Federal Reserve is buying the Treasury's debt.

40
0:02:06.921,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And the Treasury is getting that money to, mostly, Americans,

41
0:02:12.173,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in some imperfect but remarkably large way.

42
0:02:16.609,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And the Europeans are doing the same

43
0:02:19.505,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in their way.

44
0:02:20.783,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That bank is a smaller bank,

45
0:02:22.966,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because the world lives with about 70 percent dollars,

46
0:02:26.625,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and only a small percent euro,

47
0:02:28.212,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they will produce theirs for theirs,

48
0:02:30.982,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and there aren't many banks around the world.

49
0:02:33.561,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And so the rest of the world

50
0:02:36.656,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is going to have gaps, holes that won't be filled.

51
0:02:40.847,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So if you think about that and you say,

52
0:02:43.95,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"American printing of money and the borrowing

53
0:02:47.682,000 --> 0:02:49,000
will leave us with a lot of debt and monetization,"

54
0:02:50.224,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that's something interesting to talk about,

55
0:02:52.261,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we need to talk about that.

56
0:02:53.913,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Who will pay these bills,

57
0:02:55.691,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and how will that be shared,

58
0:02:57.055,000 --> 0:02:58,000
will be something we need to talk about.

59
0:02:58.99,000 --> 0:03:,000
But you will know that you will get that money.

60
0:03:01.474,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And the Europeans will get their versions of that money.

61
0:03:05.616,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But we are in a new world.

62
0:03:07.998,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And that world is most similar to the 1930-45 world,

63
0:03:12.29,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and a lot of the world will not get that money in credit.

64
0:03:15.878,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So there will be a big differentiation

65
0:03:18.576,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as to which entities benefit and which entities don't.

66
0:03:24.266,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And there will be a big collaboration as to how we will deal with that bill

67
0:03:29.694,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and who will end up with what.

68
0:03:31.639,000 --> 0:03:33,000
A big question of wealth distribution,

69
0:03:34.65,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and all of that.

70
0:03:35.825,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So that's the big thing that's going to be happening.

71
0:03:40.38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
CH: How confident are you that some of that collaboration

72
0:03:43.122,000 --> 0:03:44,000
can happen right now?

73
0:03:46.405,000 --> 0:03:49,000
RD: We're now at one of those defining moments

74
0:03:50.024,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that I've seen repeatedly.

75
0:03:52.23,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The 1930-45 period, if you go back in history,

76
0:03:56.957,000 --> 0:03:57,000
there's nothing new to this.

77
0:03:59.172,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And it's a defining moment

78
0:04:01.561,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in terms of how people are with each other.

79
0:04:04.885,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So when you look at it,

80
0:04:06.641,000 --> 0:04:08,000
will people come together

81
0:04:09.236,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or, when it comes down to it, really,

82
0:04:12.482,000 --> 0:04:18,000
will there be a taking care of oneself

83
0:04:18.792,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and what does that define, and how will that go?

84
0:04:21.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That will be, I think, a defining moment.

85
0:04:23.725,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I look at these histories.

86
0:04:26.561,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If I can take a minute,

87
0:04:27.776,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I'd like to just paint a template for you

88
0:04:30.743,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that takes us, you know, over the last thousand years,

89
0:04:34.744,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the things that have happened over and over again.

90
0:04:37.133,000 --> 0:04:39,000
There was one pattern that I'd like to convey.

91
0:04:39.734,000 --> 0:04:4,000
May I take a moment and do that?

92
0:04:42.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
CH: Absolutely.

93
0:04:44.815,000 --> 0:04:5,000
RD: There are four things that are the driving forces

94
0:04:51.411,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of our economy and our lifestyle and wealth.

95
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And the first and most powerful is productivity,

96
0:04:59.414,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which comes from people learning and inventing

97
0:05:03.317,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and doing things well, just as Marko [Russiver] described.

98
0:05:07.315,000 --> 0:05:08,000
OK?

99
0:05:08.49,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And it grows slowly.

100
0:05:10.395,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know, one or two or three percent a year.

101
0:05:12.958,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It grows slowly,

102
0:05:14.133,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and it's not volatile, because knowledge isn't volatile.

103
0:05:16.848,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But it grows,

104
0:05:18.023,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and that raises our living standards over a period of time.

105
0:05:20.824,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Then there's the short-term debt cycle.

106
0:05:23.037,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The short-term debt cycle is, you know, recessions and expansions

107
0:05:26.283,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and booms and recessions -- that.

108
0:05:28.466,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They last about eight, ten years.

109
0:05:30.783,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And then there's a long-term debt cycle.

110
0:05:33.633,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that long-term debt cycle,

111
0:05:35.458,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which goes on about once every 50 to 75 years,

112
0:05:40.329,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is when you begin a new type of money and a new type of credit.

113
0:05:44.956,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That began in 1945.

114
0:05:47.504,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The new world order at the end of World War II,

115
0:05:52.059,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and with the Bretton Woods monetary system,

116
0:05:54.608,000 --> 0:05:58,000
created a new monetary system in 1945, a new money.

117
0:05:59.147,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So they wiped out, pretty much, the old money,

118
0:06:01.546,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or they largely disposed of it,

119
0:06:03.339,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and they began anew.

120
0:06:04.688,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And that's the new world order,

121
0:06:06.22,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which was the American world order,

122
0:06:08.292,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and we have seen it,

123
0:06:09.584,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and still, 70 percent of the money and credit that exists in the economy

124
0:06:14.173,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is running by dollars,

125
0:06:15.934,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and what you have, traditionally, is the breakdown.

126
0:06:18.934,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And then the fourth influence is politics.

127
0:06:22.231,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And politics is largely how we deal with each other.

128
0:06:26.529,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And there's internal politics, and there's external politics.

129
0:06:30.684,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The internal politics is, how do you deal with the wealth gap?

130
0:06:36.712,000 --> 0:06:38,000
How do you deal with the values gap?

131
0:06:39.572,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Do you have a common mission?

132
0:06:41.998,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Do we have an American dream that we can agree on

133
0:06:45.187,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and that we're pursuing that together,

134
0:06:47.831,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or do you fight over wealth, and so on.

135
0:06:51.926,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And so when you look at history,

136
0:06:53.927,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that's what revolutions are in their various ways.

137
0:06:56.87,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And there's always a revolution in one of these.

138
0:06:59.703,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Sometimes those are peaceful revolutions

139
0:07:01.838,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and sometimes they are disruptive.

140
0:07:05.331,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But it's a wealth shift that needs to take place.

141
0:07:10.378,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Roosevelt shifted policies and changed taxes and so on in that way.

142
0:07:15.248,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And then in other countries,

143
0:07:16.974,000 --> 0:07:19,000
there was the turning over democracy.

144
0:07:20.117,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Hitler came to power because of that gap.

145
0:07:22.919,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So how people deal with each other internally.

146
0:07:25.903,000 --> 0:07:27,000
There's also external politics,

147
0:07:28.038,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so that politics means between countries.

148
0:07:31.863,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And you have a situation when there's a rising power

149
0:07:34.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
challenging existing power.

150
0:07:37.069,000 --> 0:07:4,000
There is competition, and there is a risk of war.

151
0:07:40.638,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And so how they deal with each other.

152
0:07:43.566,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Whether there's a greater good,

153
0:07:45.693,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or whether they are fighting with each other

154
0:07:50.05,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is the defining moment.

155
0:07:51.929,000 --> 0:07:53,000
There are always stress tests,

156
0:07:54.152,000 --> 0:07:59,000
these big stress tests that come along once every 75 years.

157
0:07:59.239,000 --> 0:08:,000
And when they happen --

158
0:08:00.589,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And this is a stress test.

159
0:08:02.268,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I think that what you're going to see is how we deal with each other.

160
0:08:08.013,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There's enough wealth to go around.

161
0:08:09.792,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But what do you do when you're outside the ring of support?

162
0:08:13.879,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Let's say of the US dollar.

163
0:08:16.315,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And what is that going to be like for those entities?

164
0:08:18.823,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Or if you're within the ring of support, how will that bill be divided?

165
0:08:24.131,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And how will we be with each other?

166
0:08:25.871,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I think we're going to have to reconsider

167
0:08:28.339,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who has what,

168
0:08:30.038,000 --> 0:08:32,000
what is it about education, and so on.

169
0:08:32.363,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So that's what we're in, I think.

170
0:08:35.077,000 --> 0:08:37,000
CH: And I want to get to --

171
0:08:37.252,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because you've written extensively about how capitalism needs to change,

172
0:08:40.919,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and some of the things

173
0:08:42.117,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that we should be thinking about and doing,

174
0:08:44.265,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I want to definitely get to that a little bit later on,

175
0:08:47.911,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but I am curious right now, just from a practical level,

176
0:08:51.363,000 --> 0:08:55,000
do you think that we're headed into a global depression?

177
0:08:58.398,000 --> 0:09:02,000
RD: Yes, but I want to be careful about what I use -- the word.

178
0:09:02.461,000 --> 0:09:03,000
CH: Absolutely.

179
0:09:03.636,000 --> 0:09:05,000
RD: To be technical.

180
0:09:05.755,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The word is an evocative word.

181
0:09:08.315,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it can be scary and so on.

182
0:09:10.704,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So what do you mean by a "depression," OK?

183
0:09:13.887,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Something like happened in the 1930s,

184
0:09:16.99,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so just to repeat:

185
0:09:18.196,000 --> 0:09:23,000
1929 to 1932, there was a fall in the economy.

186
0:09:24.311,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And double-digit unemployment rates.

187
0:09:27.675,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And a magnitude of fall in the economy, like, about 10 percent.

188
0:09:31.858,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Do I think we're in that?

189
0:09:33.358,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Yes.

190
0:09:34.545,000 --> 0:09:37,000
How was that dealt with, 1933?

191
0:09:38.331,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What they did is they printed a lot of money.

192
0:09:40.974,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And the government came out with the same type of programs

193
0:09:44.363,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that we're having now.

194
0:09:45.998,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Yes, OK, same thing.

195
0:09:48.188,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Interest rates hit zero.

196
0:09:50.117,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Same thing, OK, same dynamics.

197
0:09:52.863,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And then, there is --

198
0:09:54.346,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That money causes an expansion from that point.

199
0:09:58.673,000 --> 0:10:,000
How long does it take for the stock market

200
0:10:01.3,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to exceed its highs?

201
0:10:03.784,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Or how long does it take for the economy to exceed its former highs?

202
0:10:08.402,000 --> 0:10:09,000
A long time.

203
0:10:09.863,000 --> 0:10:1,000
OK.

204
0:10:11.038,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Do I think that's what we're in?

205
0:10:12.609,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Yes, that's what we're in.

206
0:10:13.889,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We've seen that happen repeatedly in history.

207
0:10:17.223,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Saw it many, many times; it's just the most recent one.

208
0:10:20.509,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And there's a structure to that.

209
0:10:22.096,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So yes, this is not a recession.

210
0:10:25.163,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This is a breakdown,

211
0:10:26.577,000 --> 0:10:3,000
an operation that I'm just describing in terms of how it's dealt with,

212
0:10:31.18,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the production of money and credit and all of that.

213
0:10:33.624,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That's what we're in.

214
0:10:35.664,000 --> 0:10:36,000
CH: And so you've talked about,

215
0:10:37.268,000 --> 0:10:41,000
there are sort of four levers to recovery after a depression:

216
0:10:42.188,000 --> 0:10:45,000
cutting spending, also known as austerity;

217
0:10:45.212,000 --> 0:10:47,000
debt restructuring, or forgiveness;

218
0:10:47.413,000 --> 0:10:5,000
redistribution of wealth through taxes, potentially;

219
0:10:51.192,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and printing of money,

220
0:10:52.709,000 --> 0:10:54,000
some of these things you've mentioned.

221
0:10:54.78,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Will those things get us out of this situation,

222
0:10:57.503,000 --> 0:11:,000
since, as you feel, it's happened before?

223
0:11:01.049,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But how would you think about balancing these tools right now?

224
0:11:06.99,000 --> 0:11:1,000
RD: Yeah, those are the tools since eternity, basically,

225
0:11:11.214,000 --> 0:11:12,000
since recorded history.

226
0:11:12.768,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Those are the ones that operated,

227
0:11:14.434,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I think what you're going to see is a combination you're seeing,

228
0:11:20.071,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of printing money and redistribution.

229
0:11:25.403,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And I think it will last ...

230
0:11:27.911,000 --> 0:11:3,000
These things happen pretty quickly,

231
0:11:31.069,000 --> 0:11:36,000
they last maybe a couple or three years in terms of that process.

232
0:11:36.899,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And then you have a rebuilding.

233
0:11:39.145,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And they're dealt with with creativity.

234
0:11:43.553,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The greatest force, through time,

235
0:11:48.617,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is inventiveness, human inventiveness,

236
0:11:52.474,000 --> 0:11:53,000
adaptability.

237
0:11:54.268,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So you're going to see these restructurings happen,

238
0:11:57.649,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and you're going to see the kind of inventiveness

239
0:12:00.221,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that you just saw from Marko, OK?

240
0:12:02.974,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And it's the power of that adaptation that is the greatest power.

241
0:12:07.615,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I did a study,

242
0:12:09.096,000 --> 0:12:11,000
which is on LinkedIn if anyone wants to see it,

243
0:12:11.452,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and it goes back 500 years.

244
0:12:15.244,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And it shows real GDP.

245
0:12:19.569,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In other words,

246
0:12:20.759,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the economic activity going back there.

247
0:12:23.633,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And there's a line.

248
0:12:24.872,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And you don't see these depressions, as we're calling them,

249
0:12:29.586,000 --> 0:12:31,000
even on that line that barely wiggles.

250
0:12:31.871,000 --> 0:12:35,000
When you go into it and you look at that piece,

251
0:12:36.103,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that's what it looks like.

252
0:12:37.382,000 --> 0:12:39,000
GDP falls 10 percent, unemployment goes up,

253
0:12:40.049,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and it passes.

254
0:12:41.752,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And because the greatest force is the force of adaptation

255
0:12:46.584,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and inventiveness,

256
0:12:47.767,000 --> 0:12:49,000
if we can operate well together.

257
0:12:49.83,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So that's what I think it's going to look like

258
0:12:52.275,000 --> 0:12:53,000
over this period of time.

259
0:12:53.505,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It will pass,

260
0:12:54.775,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the world will be very different,

261
0:12:56.497,000 --> 0:12:57,000
there will be a new world order,

262
0:12:58.43,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but it will pass,

263
0:12:59.833,000 --> 0:13:,000
and we'll be inventive,

264
0:13:01.171,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because what we're dealing with now is just money and credit.

265
0:13:05.478,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Money and credit is just digital.

266
0:13:07.795,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I mean, there's no --

267
0:13:09.426,000 --> 0:13:12,000
There is real good services, you know, those are real.

268
0:13:13.267,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But everything else is just accounting.

269
0:13:15.75,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so when you change the digits,

270
0:13:17.798,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and you work those things out,

271
0:13:19.4,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and you work yourself through,

272
0:13:20.892,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that takes, you know, a couple of years at most, kind of.

273
0:13:24.504,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And then you come back into a restructured environment.

274
0:13:27.964,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And it could be said that it is really healthy in many ways.

275
0:13:32.512,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Because it is a stress test.

276
0:13:34.599,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Because if you look at history, people have gotten --

277
0:13:37.839,000 --> 0:13:38,000
sometimes they get weaker,

278
0:13:39.427,000 --> 0:13:41,000
or they're not prepared in many ways.

279
0:13:42.72,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Weaker in terms of,

280
0:13:44.1,000 --> 0:13:46,000
maybe they don't build enough savings and they operate that,

281
0:13:46.983,000 --> 0:13:48,000
or maybe they emphasize luxuries over necessities.

282
0:13:49.823,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's a reorienting type of experience

283
0:13:53.405,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that, in many ways, makes us healthy.

284
0:13:55.421,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Even appreciating the basics of life.

285
0:13:59.913,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Chris Anderson: Ray, just popping in here

286
0:14:01.956,000 --> 0:14:03,000
with a couple of questions from our online audience.

287
0:14:04.409,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I mean, the main question early on

288
0:14:06.082,000 --> 0:14:1,000
was just, how difficult do you think the days ahead are for the economy.

289
0:14:10.999,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And you've answered that very vigorously.

290
0:14:13.427,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Like, using that word, "depression,"

291
0:14:16.751,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that's a very strong word.

292
0:14:19.648,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Tell me if I have this right --

293
0:14:21.152,000 --> 0:14:23,000
it feels to me like what you just said there

294
0:14:23.474,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is stronger than most people in the market seem to believe.

295
0:14:28.386,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The market is behaving as if,

296
0:14:31.576,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you know, we've had the bad news,

297
0:14:33.584,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and it sort of, kind of wants to come back

298
0:14:35.641,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and a lot of people seem to think that within, I don't know, a year,

299
0:14:38.895,000 --> 0:14:4,000
we'll kind of be back where we are.

300
0:14:41.188,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You're saying, no, it's going to take longer.

301
0:14:43.316,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Does that imply that there is basically

302
0:14:46.315,000 --> 0:14:5,000
sort of some systemic shots that the market hasn't yet fully seen,

303
0:14:50.593,000 --> 0:14:54,000
perhaps to do with the inability of some players to handle

304
0:14:54.847,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the extreme levels of debt that are piling up right now,

305
0:14:57.982,000 --> 0:14:58,000
as people can't work?

306
0:15:02.702,000 --> 0:15:07,000
RD: Yeah, I can't speak for what everybody's thinking out there,

307
0:15:08.307,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you know, the markets are off,

308
0:15:10.418,000 --> 0:15:13,000
depending on what market and depending on what country you're in,

309
0:15:13.665,000 --> 0:15:17,000
you know, something in the vicinity of 25 to 45 or 50 percent,

310
0:15:18.684,000 --> 0:15:2,000
depending what currency you're managing.

311
0:15:20.994,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And so if you're talking about emerging markets,

312
0:15:24.224,000 --> 0:15:25,000
they're worse,

313
0:15:25.398,000 --> 0:15:27,000
because they're not going to get as much, and so on.

314
0:15:27.859,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I can describe what I see, OK?

315
0:15:31.133,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We see something like 20 trillion dollars of losses.

316
0:15:37.789,000 --> 0:15:4,000
OK, we see --

317
0:15:41.066,000 --> 0:15:45,000
If you work that through, and you say you don't have money,

318
0:15:45.511,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and you don't have credit,

319
0:15:47.097,000 --> 0:15:48,000
your business can fail.

320
0:15:49.581,000 --> 0:15:51,000
You know this, we see this all around us.

321
0:15:51.891,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So there can be failures when there can't be payments.

322
0:15:56.391,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And so the question is, who gets what check

323
0:15:59.276,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to make those payments and get past it,

324
0:16:01.509,000 --> 0:16:06,000
but we're going to have a giant restructuring of the IOUs

325
0:16:06.715,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and we're going to work out.

326
0:16:08.104,000 --> 0:16:11,000
When hospitals can go broke --

327
0:16:11.924,000 --> 0:16:14,000
because this is terribly costly for hospitals,

328
0:16:14.996,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and they will not fully recover their losses,

329
0:16:19.249,000 --> 0:16:2,000
hospitals will go broke,

330
0:16:20.665,000 --> 0:16:21,000
even though we know that they need them.

331
0:16:22.617,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So you have to go entity by entity

332
0:16:25.625,000 --> 0:16:26,000
through this.

333
0:16:26.809,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And then you'll go through the process of who will pay.

334
0:16:29.411,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So this is not --

335
0:16:31.363,000 --> 0:16:33,000
You know, some people mistake this as --

336
0:16:34.163,000 --> 0:16:39,000
There is a virus, and the virus may come and go, OK?

337
0:16:39.357,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Maybe we never see it again.

338
0:16:40.736,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I don't think that's likely,

339
0:16:42.141,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but people tell me, but who knows.

340
0:16:45.339,000 --> 0:16:47,000
But if it never came back again,

341
0:16:48.307,000 --> 0:16:52,000
there will be those who are broke and who will have loss of income.

342
0:16:53.061,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We're going to change how we operate, in a way.

343
0:16:56.204,000 --> 0:16:58,000
The supply lines are going to change.

344
0:16:58.621,000 --> 0:17:,000
In other words, self-sufficiency.

345
0:17:00.844,000 --> 0:17:03,000
What is self-sufficiency now going to mean?

346
0:17:03.891,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Do we have enough of this and that?

347
0:17:05.606,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We're going to restructure our economy.

348
0:17:07.704,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And restructure the financial system

349
0:17:10.092,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in ways that mean

350
0:17:11.935,000 --> 0:17:14,000
we are not going to go back to the way it was.

351
0:17:16.173,000 --> 0:17:19,000
CA: So do you see systemic threats to the financial industry

352
0:17:19.434,000 --> 0:17:22,000
as great or greater than happened in 2008?

353
0:17:23.736,000 --> 0:17:26,000
RD: Yeah, this is bigger than what happened in 2008.

354
0:17:26.974,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I'll distinguish it.

355
0:17:28.205,000 --> 0:17:31,000
In 2008, we had banks.

356
0:17:32.688,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It's the same thing, meaning,

357
0:17:34.149,000 --> 0:17:35,000
you have a certain amount of leverage,

358
0:17:36.006,000 --> 0:17:37,000
things go down,

359
0:17:37.633,000 --> 0:17:4,000
too much leverage means you're broke, in accounting terms.

360
0:17:41.466,000 --> 0:17:43,000
So then you look around and you say,

361
0:17:43.768,000 --> 0:17:47,000
who are the systemically important entities that you don't want to go broke?

362
0:17:47.935,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Because, do you want to lose those banks at this time?

363
0:17:51.159,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And then you can make up money and make up credit

364
0:17:54.635,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and you can keep them alive in some way,

365
0:17:58.056,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and you did it with banks,

366
0:17:59.342,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and through the banks, there were the mortgages,

367
0:18:01.76,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and that's what it looked like.

368
0:18:03.268,000 --> 0:18:04,000
This is more complex than that,

369
0:18:05.038,000 --> 0:18:06,000
because there are the banks,

370
0:18:06.775,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and then there are those, all of those that are beyond banks.

371
0:18:10.347,000 --> 0:18:12,000
All the little businesses,

372
0:18:12.546,000 --> 0:18:15,000
all of those in all the different places that are beyond it.

373
0:18:16.3,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And it's a bigger crisis.

374
0:18:18.522,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And we have a less effective monetary policy,

375
0:18:22.276,000 --> 0:18:25,000
because interest rates declines have reached their limit.

376
0:18:25.736,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And just buying financial assets by the central bank

377
0:18:29.331,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and buying the normal financial assets won't work.

378
0:18:32.293,000 --> 0:18:34,000
They have to buy the debt of the government

379
0:18:35.055,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and the government, or the many governments,

380
0:18:37.88,000 --> 0:18:41,000
have to be effective in getting buying power and production

381
0:18:42.503,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to those who need it around the world.

382
0:18:47.069,000 --> 0:18:48,000
CA: I have one last question,

383
0:18:48.475,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and then I'll be back at the end of the hour, Corey,

384
0:18:51.009,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and it's back to you.

385
0:18:52.291,000 --> 0:18:53,000
So, given how bleak that is,

386
0:18:53.862,000 --> 0:18:57,000
people are asking, what kinds of industries, organizations, companies

387
0:18:58.48,000 --> 0:19:01,000
have the best prospects of thriving, going forward?

388
0:19:03.076,000 --> 0:19:06,000
RD: Well, you see, that's the beauty of it.

389
0:19:07.929,000 --> 0:19:09,000
There are two types, basically.

390
0:19:10.326,000 --> 0:19:15,000
There are those that are stable, meat-and-potatoes,

391
0:19:15.699,000 --> 0:19:17,000
not-leverage kind of companies,

392
0:19:18.18,000 --> 0:19:21,000
you know, the Campbell soup equivalent,

393
0:19:21.434,000 --> 0:19:24,000
you know, everybody's going to use them all the time, kind of thing.

394
0:19:24.736,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And then, there are the innovators.

395
0:19:28.137,000 --> 0:19:31,000
The innovators like, we're talking about Marko.

396
0:19:32.116,000 --> 0:19:33,000
You had Marko on before.

397
0:19:33.994,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And that new innovation,

398
0:19:36.129,000 --> 0:19:39,000
those who can adapt well and innovate well,

399
0:19:39.78,000 --> 0:19:42,000
and don't have balance sheet problems,

400
0:19:43.109,000 --> 0:19:45,000
in other words, they have strong balance sheets

401
0:19:45.331,000 --> 0:19:48,000
so they're going to be able to play the game without having that.

402
0:19:48.546,000 --> 0:19:49,000
They will be great winners.

403
0:19:50.363,000 --> 0:19:52,000
And so there's always new inventions,

404
0:19:52.99,000 --> 0:19:53,000
new creativity,

405
0:19:54.744,000 --> 0:19:56,000
that is the new adaptation

406
0:19:57.252,000 --> 0:20:,000
that becomes a company and an entrepreneur.

407
0:20:00.466,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And they're going to do great,

408
0:20:02.157,000 --> 0:20:04,000
plus the stuff that we're always going to need.

409
0:20:04.744,000 --> 0:20:06,000
Those are the things that are going to do great.

410
0:20:08.37,000 --> 0:20:09,000
CA: Thank you, Ray.

411
0:20:09.911,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Corey.

412
0:20:11.103,000 --> 0:20:12,000
CH: Thank you, Chris.

413
0:20:14.077,000 --> 0:20:18,000
So I guess I'd like to stay with the market for a minute.

414
0:20:18.99,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Obviously, it's something that interests so many people.

415
0:20:21.712,000 --> 0:20:23,000
The state of the market doesn't always correlate

416
0:20:24.702,000 --> 0:20:27,000
with what's going on in the economy.

417
0:20:28.021,000 --> 0:20:31,000
And the market and its players have changed so much

418
0:20:31.889,000 --> 0:20:33,000
over the past, you know, 70 years or so,

419
0:20:34.719,000 --> 0:20:36,000
70, 90 years.

420
0:20:36.83,000 --> 0:20:4,000
So many more algorithms, and machines and passive investing.

421
0:20:41.577,000 --> 0:20:46,000
And how do you think that affects how the market is behaving right now,

422
0:20:47.093,000 --> 0:20:52,000
how it's going to recover over the next, you know, few years,

423
0:20:52.203,000 --> 0:20:54,000
as the economy recovers?

424
0:20:57.393,000 --> 0:21:,000
RD: The basic fundamentals

425
0:21:01.053,000 --> 0:21:06,000
of money credit crisis,

426
0:21:06.633,000 --> 0:21:08,000
who has what income,

427
0:21:09.188,000 --> 0:21:1,000
who has what expenses,

428
0:21:10.387,000 --> 0:21:12,000
who has what balance sheet,

429
0:21:12.673,000 --> 0:21:14,000
and how do we deal with money and credit --

430
0:21:15.403,000 --> 0:21:18,000
those things, which people often lose sight of,

431
0:21:18.874,000 --> 0:21:21,000
because they happen only once in one's lifetime.

432
0:21:22.001,000 --> 0:21:27,000
This period, you have to go back to the 1930s as the last period.

433
0:21:27.473,000 --> 0:21:29,000
Those fundamentals of what a bank is,

434
0:21:30.482,000 --> 0:21:32,000
and the associated process,

435
0:21:33.472,000 --> 0:21:35,000
have existed all through time.

436
0:21:36.411,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Then it's, like, technology changes.

437
0:21:41.442,000 --> 0:21:42,000
Technology evolves.

438
0:21:43.712,000 --> 0:21:49,000
And so the capacity to take one's thinking and to put them in algorithms --

439
0:21:50.3,000 --> 0:21:52,000
we've been doing this for 25 years.

440
0:21:53.117,000 --> 0:21:56,000
The way we operate is to take a principle,

441
0:21:56.751,000 --> 0:21:58,000
"How would I deal with that situation,"

442
0:21:59.038,000 --> 0:22:01,000
and write it down, put it into an algorithm,

443
0:22:01.807,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and then, because the capacity to think has been radically enhanced,

444
0:22:08.327,000 --> 0:22:11,000
because the human mind has a capacity problem.

445
0:22:12.287,000 --> 0:22:14,000
It's unique in inventing.

446
0:22:14.998,000 --> 0:22:18,000
But it can only process so much in so [much] time.

447
0:22:19.101,000 --> 0:22:23,000
So when worked in partnership with the computer,

448
0:22:23.379,000 --> 0:22:26,000
which has the capacity to take that thinking

449
0:22:26.657,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and replicate it and do all of that leverage thinking,

450
0:22:30.284,000 --> 0:22:32,000
and thinking in advanced way,

451
0:22:32.464,000 --> 0:22:34,000
that is the advancement of our time.

452
0:22:35.037,000 --> 0:22:36,000
And so you're seeing that.

453
0:22:36.514,000 --> 0:22:38,000
So when you think algorithmic,

454
0:22:39.444,000 --> 0:22:41,000
you know, you've got to break it down as to what it is.

455
0:22:42.466,000 --> 0:22:46,000
Is it sensible cause-effect relationships that are being dealt with?

456
0:22:48.212,000 --> 0:22:51,000
It all comes back to "Do you have understanding,

457
0:22:51.879,000 --> 0:22:56,000
and are you successfully betting on a cause-effect relationship?"

458
0:22:57.251,000 --> 0:23:,000
Because that's the only way you're going to make money.

459
0:23:01.062,000 --> 0:23:04,000
But the computer can do it, process that thing,

460
0:23:04.736,000 --> 0:23:05,000
in a much more advanced way.

461
0:23:06.546,000 --> 0:23:08,000
So that's what's going on.

462
0:23:08.608,000 --> 0:23:09,000
There will be people

463
0:23:09.794,000 --> 0:23:12,000
who will make the mistake of just applying machine learning

464
0:23:13.694,000 --> 0:23:14,000
to the markets.

465
0:23:14.942,000 --> 0:23:18,000
And that generally won't work because of certain things.

466
0:23:19.918,000 --> 0:23:21,000
I guess I should explain, because you asked, so ...

467
0:23:23.649,000 --> 0:23:26,000
On algorithmic decision-making,

468
0:23:27.331,000 --> 0:23:29,000
there are two ways you can get your algorithm.

469
0:23:30.077,000 --> 0:23:34,000
You can specify the instruction to the computer and have it follow that

470
0:23:34.452,000 --> 0:23:36,000
and that will enable your thinking.

471
0:23:37.165,000 --> 0:23:41,000
Or you can have the algorithm come from putting a lot of data

472
0:23:42.026,000 --> 0:23:43,000
into the computer,

473
0:23:43.52,000 --> 0:23:47,000
and asking, "Computer, what would you do, and what's your algorithm?"

474
0:23:47.893,000 --> 0:23:49,000
The key difference between those

475
0:23:49.924,000 --> 0:23:54,000
is do you have understanding of the cause-effect relationships?

476
0:23:56.022,000 --> 0:23:59,000
You must have understanding of the cause-effect relationships

477
0:23:59.372,000 --> 0:24:,000
to know what to believe in.

478
0:24:01.372,000 --> 0:24:03,000
Because you can't always get that in your sample size.

479
0:24:04.197,000 --> 0:24:06,000
For example, what's happening now,

480
0:24:06.316,000 --> 0:24:09,000
you could not have run your computer

481
0:24:09.522,000 --> 0:24:11,000
and have it in your sample size,

482
0:24:11.657,000 --> 0:24:13,000
because you would have to go back to the 1930s

483
0:24:14.32,000 --> 0:24:15,000
to have an analogous period.

484
0:24:16.236,000 --> 0:24:18,000
So what you --

485
0:24:18.442,000 --> 0:24:19,000
It is how you do that,

486
0:24:19.713,000 --> 0:24:22,000
but the capacity to learn, to invent,

487
0:24:23.545,000 --> 0:24:26,000
and to get, you know, that leverage in decision-making,

488
0:24:27.379,000 --> 0:24:28,000
is greater than ever before.

489
0:24:29.228,000 --> 0:24:31,000
And that's the power of our time.

490
0:24:31.49,000 --> 0:24:33,000
Some will do it well, some will do it poorly,

491
0:24:34.283,000 --> 0:24:37,000
but it really comes down to do you have the understanding

492
0:24:37.728,000 --> 0:24:39,000
of those cause-effect relationships,

493
0:24:40.188,000 --> 0:24:42,000
so that you know how to place the right bet.

494
0:24:43.371,000 --> 0:24:47,000
CH: But that's very different from the passive investment market,

495
0:24:47.458,000 --> 0:24:49,000
which is such a huge part of it now,

496
0:24:49.724,000 --> 0:24:51,000
and that's where most people,

497
0:24:52.031,000 --> 0:24:54,000
you know, the average person has their money.

498
0:24:54.609,000 --> 0:24:57,000
And I know that everything is changing day-to-day,

499
0:24:57.774,000 --> 0:24:59,000
but I also know that everyone is going to have this question

500
0:25:00.705,000 --> 0:25:01,000
on their minds.

501
0:25:01.887,000 --> 0:25:02,000
So I'm going to ask you --

502
0:25:03.226,000 --> 0:25:05,000
I'm not going to ask for specific investment advice,

503
0:25:05.71,000 --> 0:25:07,000
but everyone's thinking about their 401(k)s.

504
0:25:08.706,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Do you have any general thoughts

505
0:25:10.286,000 --> 0:25:15,000
about how people should approach this time period with that kind of money?

506
0:25:16.703,000 --> 0:25:17,000
RD: Yeah.

507
0:25:17.893,000 --> 0:25:18,000
First of all ...

508
0:25:20.521,000 --> 0:25:24,000
an investor must understand

509
0:25:24.576,000 --> 0:25:27,000
that they probably will not be able to play the game well.

510
0:25:28.321,000 --> 0:25:31,000
They probably will not be able to decide how to move in

511
0:25:31.976,000 --> 0:25:33,000
and out of things.

512
0:25:34.297,000 --> 0:25:36,000
In order to be successful in the markets,

513
0:25:36.468,000 --> 0:25:42,000
it is more difficult than getting a gold medal in the Olympics.

514
0:25:43.583,000 --> 0:25:45,000
You wouldn't think about competing in the Olympics,

515
0:25:46.244,000 --> 0:25:48,000
but everybody thinks they can compete in the markets.

516
0:25:49.088,000 --> 0:25:51,000
But there's more money competing.

517
0:25:51.54,000 --> 0:25:52,000
It's like a zero-sum game

518
0:25:53.381,000 --> 0:25:54,000
and there's more money doing it,

519
0:25:54.945,000 --> 0:25:55,000
and the worst thing you could do

520
0:25:56.544,000 --> 0:26:,000
is think you can time all of these movements.

521
0:26:00.796,000 --> 0:26:03,000
I guarantee you, the game is a tough game.

522
0:26:04.034,000 --> 0:26:07,000
We put hundreds of millions of dollars into the game every year.

523
0:26:07.328,000 --> 0:26:08,000
And it's tough.

524
0:26:09.085,000 --> 0:26:12,000
So what the individual investor needs to do

525
0:26:12.99,000 --> 0:26:15,000
is know how to diversify well.

526
0:26:16.8,000 --> 0:26:17,000
So the word that I would --

527
0:26:18.425,000 --> 0:26:22,000
Know how to diversify well and in a balanced way.

528
0:26:22.95,000 --> 0:26:24,000
The greatest mistake of all investors

529
0:26:25.807,000 --> 0:26:29,000
is to think that what has done well lately

530
0:26:30.133,000 --> 0:26:31,000
is a better investment,

531
0:26:32.149,000 --> 0:26:33,000
rather than more expensive.

532
0:26:34.347,000 --> 0:26:39,000
And what has done worse lately is the worst investment,

533
0:26:40.062,000 --> 0:26:41,000
"get me out of it,"

534
0:26:41.728,000 --> 0:26:42,000
rather than "it's cheap."

535
0:26:43.672,000 --> 0:26:46,000
And unless you know how to deal with the differences of those,

536
0:26:46.704,000 --> 0:26:47,000
which most people don't,

537
0:26:47.95,000 --> 0:26:48,000
they're going to be in trouble.

538
0:26:49.482,000 --> 0:26:51,000
So understand that wealth,

539
0:26:51.783,000 --> 0:26:53,000
total amount of wealth in the world,

540
0:26:54.641,000 --> 0:26:57,000
essentially doesn't change very much, OK?

541
0:26:57.823,000 --> 0:27:,000
And that one thing goes up, another thing goes down.

542
0:27:01.577,000 --> 0:27:03,000
And to know how to diversify.

543
0:27:03.902,000 --> 0:27:05,000
To diversify it in asset classes,

544
0:27:06.419,000 --> 0:27:08,000
to diversify it in countries.

545
0:27:09.901,000 --> 0:27:11,000
To diversify it in currencies.

546
0:27:12.48,000 --> 0:27:15,000
To know how to diversify that well,

547
0:27:15.821,000 --> 0:27:18,000
so that you have wealth diversification, is important.

548
0:27:18.972,000 --> 0:27:22,000
Do not think that cash is a safe investment.

549
0:27:23.981,000 --> 0:27:26,000
Most people think, "Look, I just want safety.

550
0:27:27.792,000 --> 0:27:3,000
And those bonds aren't giving me an interest rate," and so on,

551
0:27:31.053,000 --> 0:27:32,000
"So where do I get safe?"

552
0:27:33.855,000 --> 0:27:35,000
Cash is a seductive investment,

553
0:27:36.45,000 --> 0:27:38,000
because it doesn't have as much volatility.

554
0:27:39.41,000 --> 0:27:43,000
But it taxes you and your buying power about two percent a year.

555
0:27:44.854,000 --> 0:27:48,000
And so cash is almost always the worst investment.

556
0:27:49.584,000 --> 0:27:5,000
So you have to think about that.

557
0:27:51.283,000 --> 0:27:53,000
You should think a little bit unconventionally.

558
0:27:54.084,000 --> 0:27:56,000
Do you have a little bit of gold?

559
0:27:56.302,000 --> 0:27:58,000
Do you have a little bit of,

560
0:27:58.797,000 --> 0:28:02,000
in case this monetary system breaks down and money is redefined,

561
0:28:02.889,000 --> 0:28:03,000
do you have a little bit of that?

562
0:28:04.62,000 --> 0:28:08,000
I can't get into all the different ways that one can diversify well.

563
0:28:09.079,000 --> 0:28:11,000
I try to convey those things in my books,

564
0:28:11.231,000 --> 0:28:16,000
or posts on LinkedIn, particularly.

565
0:28:16.895,000 --> 0:28:18,000
But I would say, diversify well,

566
0:28:19.76,000 --> 0:28:21,000
be humble, don't market time

567
0:28:22.45,000 --> 0:28:25,000
and be conscious of the dangers of cash.

568
0:28:27.171,000 --> 0:28:29,000
CH: Right, that's great advice.

569
0:28:29.751,000 --> 0:28:32,000
I want to ask one more, sort of, big-picture question

570
0:28:33.045,000 --> 0:28:36,000
before we start getting into how we should fix capitalism.

571
0:28:36.268,000 --> 0:28:38,000
We can talk about that in a minute,

572
0:28:38.958,000 --> 0:28:39,000
tackle that one.

573
0:28:40.665,000 --> 0:28:42,000
But I have been reading your series on LinkedIn,

574
0:28:42.992,000 --> 0:28:43,000
"The Changing World Order."

575
0:28:44.952,000 --> 0:28:45,000
It's really fascinating.

576
0:28:46.635,000 --> 0:28:47,000
I'm curious what you think about,

577
0:28:48.341,000 --> 0:28:52,000
there's been, sort of, this retreat from globalization

578
0:28:52.595,000 --> 0:28:54,000
as something we should all get behind,

579
0:28:54.955,000 --> 0:28:58,000
and I'm curious what you think about that in terms of our recovery.

580
0:28:59.357,000 --> 0:29:,000
This seems like something

581
0:29:00.754,000 --> 0:29:03,000
that is going to require a coordinated effort,

582
0:29:04.151,000 --> 0:29:06,000
you know, financially, spiritually,

583
0:29:07.125,000 --> 0:29:08,000
in so many different ways.

584
0:29:08.53,000 --> 0:29:1,000
If we retreat from globalization right now,

585
0:29:10.887,000 --> 0:29:13,000
does that make everything harder going forward?

586
0:29:16.88,000 --> 0:29:18,000
RD: If we retreat from globalization,

587
0:29:19.007,000 --> 0:29:2,000
which we certainly will do,

588
0:29:21.023,000 --> 0:29:23,000
it will certainly make things very hard.

589
0:29:24.387,000 --> 0:29:28,000
And so we get down to comparing idealism

590
0:29:28.752,000 --> 0:29:29,000
with reality.

591
0:29:30.664,000 --> 0:29:36,000
So when you say globalization, will that --

592
0:29:37.347,000 --> 0:29:42,000
who will write what checks to people in countries

593
0:29:42.603,000 --> 0:29:44,000
that will be outside of their domain?

594
0:29:45.206,000 --> 0:29:47,000
And there are large numbers of those people.

595
0:29:48.159,000 --> 0:29:51,000
You know, my wife and I are trying to help people in Connecticut.

596
0:29:51.418,000 --> 0:29:55,000
And you know, I can rattle off all that is, what a job that is,

597
0:29:55.784,000 --> 0:29:56,000
and so on.

598
0:29:56.97,000 --> 0:29:59,000
And so, when you have congresses and presidents

599
0:30:00.666,000 --> 0:30:02,000
and they start to say, who will we help,

600
0:30:03.158,000 --> 0:30:04,000
and how will that be,

601
0:30:04.634,000 --> 0:30:05,000
and what will that mean,

602
0:30:06.174,000 --> 0:30:08,000
it gets down to real practical questions.

603
0:30:09.19,000 --> 0:30:1,000
And the reality is,

604
0:30:10.38,000 --> 0:30:12,000
a lot of those people won't be helped.

605
0:30:12.846,000 --> 0:30:13,000
And then you'll deal with,

606
0:30:14.719,000 --> 0:30:16,000
how will they behave for each other?

607
0:30:17.461,000 --> 0:30:23,000
One country's vulnerabilities, another country's opportunities.

608
0:30:23.776,000 --> 0:30:27,000
In such times, this is the case, because --

609
0:30:28.63,000 --> 0:30:31,000
You know, Graham Allison

610
0:30:31.956,000 --> 0:30:33,000
wrote a book about the Thucydides trap,

611
0:30:34.665,000 --> 0:30:35,000
and he reminds us,

612
0:30:36.482,000 --> 0:30:38,000
over the last 500 years,

613
0:30:38.604,000 --> 0:30:4,000
there have been 16 countries

614
0:30:41.553,000 --> 0:30:44,000
in which there's been a rivalry of an empire challenging another.

615
0:30:45.55,000 --> 0:30:47,000
In 12 of those cases, there have been wars.

616
0:30:48.662,000 --> 0:30:52,000
Because, at the end of the day, there's not even a global legal system.

617
0:30:53.085,000 --> 0:30:57,000
Power is what is the currency of that.

618
0:30:58.006,000 --> 0:31:01,000
So when you get into how do you resolve the dispute

619
0:31:01.641,000 --> 0:31:03,000
as to who gets what,

620
0:31:03.752,000 --> 0:31:05,000
that becomes a very complicated question.

621
0:31:06.974,000 --> 0:31:08,000
So I'm a globalist.

622
0:31:09.3,000 --> 0:31:12,000
Meaning, I have a dream and a wish

623
0:31:12.831,000 --> 0:31:15,000
that the best of the best can operate together

624
0:31:16.06,000 --> 0:31:19,000
and work together for that common good and so on.

625
0:31:19.561,000 --> 0:31:2,000
But it's dying,

626
0:31:21.315,000 --> 0:31:24,000
because we're in an interconnected, fragmented world.

627
0:31:25.525,000 --> 0:31:26,000
The fragmentation of this,

628
0:31:27.474,000 --> 0:31:31,000
"Can I depend on somebody else to give me something I need?"

629
0:31:32.145,000 --> 0:31:36,000
Or "Can I depend on them not taking advantage of me?"

630
0:31:36.17,000 --> 0:31:38,000
No, you can't make those dependencies anymore.

631
0:31:39.075,000 --> 0:31:42,000
And that exists within countries as well as between countries.

632
0:31:43.511,000 --> 0:31:46,000
CH: Yeah, I mean, it seems like, you talk about productivity

633
0:31:47.157,000 --> 0:31:52,000
and the importance of productivity for us all to have a better life,

634
0:31:52.411,000 --> 0:31:54,000
and it just seems like on a global level,

635
0:31:54.73,000 --> 0:31:55,000
the same should hold true.

636
0:31:56.077,000 --> 0:31:59,000
If we're all focused on being more productive together,

637
0:31:59.617,000 --> 0:32:,000
and in that interconnected way,

638
0:32:01.125,000 --> 0:32:02,000
we'll all do better,

639
0:32:02.324,000 --> 0:32:05,000
as opposed to, kind of, hoarding one asset

640
0:32:05.831,000 --> 0:32:08,000
or one set of resources.

641
0:32:09.515,000 --> 0:32:11,000
RD: You're certainly true.

642
0:32:12.92,000 --> 0:32:15,000
That has always been true, but never more true than today.

643
0:32:17.712,000 --> 0:32:2,000
And at the same time,

644
0:32:20.8,000 --> 0:32:21,000
read history.

645
0:32:23.22,000 --> 0:32:25,000
And understand the mechanics

646
0:32:25.669,000 --> 0:32:27,000
and the issues and the challenges of this.

647
0:32:28.526,000 --> 0:32:31,000
This separation began before we had

648
0:32:31.986,000 --> 0:32:35,000
this isolation of the United States relative to the rest of the world.

649
0:32:36.752,000 --> 0:32:38,000
This deglobalization

650
0:32:39.172,000 --> 0:32:43,000
began before we had this that fosters more of it, right?

651
0:32:44.093,000 --> 0:32:47,000
And it happened for reasons, OK?

652
0:32:47.173,000 --> 0:32:49,000
So don't overlook those reasons,

653
0:32:49.292,000 --> 0:32:51,000
and don't overlook the reading of history,

654
0:32:52.086,000 --> 0:32:54,000
just because we wish it can happen.

655
0:32:54.737,000 --> 0:32:55,000
If you want to wish it happens,

656
0:32:56.76,000 --> 0:32:58,000
everything is all dependent

657
0:32:59.364,000 --> 0:33:01,000
on the behavior of those

658
0:33:01.661,000 --> 0:33:04,000
who have their hands on the levers of power.

659
0:33:05.03,000 --> 0:33:08,000
I would tell you, like, for example, right now --

660
0:33:08.95,000 --> 0:33:11,000
I've been going to China for a long time,

661
0:33:12.649,000 --> 0:33:17,000
and the Chinese, in many ways, are helping,

662
0:33:17.688,000 --> 0:33:21,000
in many ways, things that are needed in this crisis and all that.

663
0:33:22.593,000 --> 0:33:23,000
To even say that

664
0:33:24.593,000 --> 0:33:28,000
is a politically challenging thing, OK?

665
0:33:28.656,000 --> 0:33:31,000
Because we're in a world that is so fragmented

666
0:33:32.411,000 --> 0:33:34,000
that even to publicly say "thank you,"

667
0:33:35.3,000 --> 0:33:39,000
and "thank you" to many people and many companies --

668
0:33:39.451,000 --> 0:33:43,000
It's almost dangerous to say "thank you" to those who are helping,

669
0:33:44.157,000 --> 0:33:5,000
because we're now in an environment in which there are enemies.

670
0:33:50.451,000 --> 0:33:51,000
And who is evil?

671
0:33:52.11,000 --> 0:33:54,000
And do you fall into that category?

672
0:33:54.776,000 --> 0:33:56,000
And so, the history of these

673
0:33:57.15,000 --> 0:34:,000
is there's demonizations of different people.

674
0:34:01.275,000 --> 0:34:02,000
OK?

675
0:34:02.452,000 --> 0:34:03,000
Now you must see it around you.

676
0:34:04.465,000 --> 0:34:05,000
It exists.

677
0:34:05.806,000 --> 0:34:1,000
And so how we come out of this will be how we behave with each other.

678
0:34:11.904,000 --> 0:34:12,000
CH: Yeah.

679
0:34:13.079,000 --> 0:34:14,000
That's such an important point,

680
0:34:14.586,000 --> 0:34:16,000
and I think all of us here would say "thank you"

681
0:34:17.603,000 --> 0:34:2,000
to, you know, the different people helping out in this situation.

682
0:34:21.245,000 --> 0:34:23,000
We do need each other.

683
0:34:24.004,000 --> 0:34:27,000
I do want to get to this issue of capitalism.

684
0:34:27.719,000 --> 0:34:29,000
Because when we talked a few days ago,

685
0:34:29.846,000 --> 0:34:32,000
you mentioned -- and earlier in this conversation as well --

686
0:34:33.228,000 --> 0:34:36,000
how, you know, this period of time we can emerge stronger and better

687
0:34:37.006,000 --> 0:34:38,000
than before.

688
0:34:38.355,000 --> 0:34:41,000
And about a year ago, you wrote a piece

689
0:34:41.41,000 --> 0:34:45,000
about how capitalism needs to be reformed,

690
0:34:45.442,000 --> 0:34:48,000
focused a lot on the wealth gap, the growing wealth gap

691
0:34:48.593,000 --> 0:34:5,000
and the problems that that's causing.

692
0:34:50.823,000 --> 0:34:51,000
So what's our opportunity here,

693
0:34:52.522,000 --> 0:34:53,000
what changes can we make?

694
0:34:55.998,000 --> 0:35:,000
RD: Well, you know, what I was seeing was,

695
0:35:01.061,000 --> 0:35:03,000
do we want the outcomes that we're getting,

696
0:35:03.67,000 --> 0:35:04,000
that the system is producing?

697
0:35:06.144,000 --> 0:35:07,000
Do we have --

698
0:35:08.033,000 --> 0:35:09,000
What is our American dream?

699
0:35:11.85,000 --> 0:35:12,000
What is that?

700
0:35:13.04,000 --> 0:35:15,000
We're not even almost talking about that.

701
0:35:15.958,000 --> 0:35:16,000
When I was growing up --

702
0:35:17.879,000 --> 0:35:21,000
So again, I was born 1949,

703
0:35:22.633,000 --> 0:35:24,000
right after the new world order was created.

704
0:35:25.014,000 --> 0:35:27,000
New world order was created 1945.

705
0:35:28.522,000 --> 0:35:29,000
In 1945.

706
0:35:29.953,000 --> 0:35:31,000
And that was when there was the breakdown of the system

707
0:35:32.577,000 --> 0:35:33,000
and then we had a new world order.

708
0:35:34.276,000 --> 0:35:35,000
We didn't have as much debt,

709
0:35:35.657,000 --> 0:35:36,000
we came back [from] the war,

710
0:35:37.053,000 --> 0:35:41,000
and there was an environment of equal opportunity.

711
0:35:42.506,000 --> 0:35:45,000
And that notion of equal opportunity.

712
0:35:46.206,000 --> 0:35:48,000
And there was an American dream.

713
0:35:48.634,000 --> 0:35:49,000
And there was a harmony

714
0:35:50.237,000 --> 0:35:52,000
and a going through it together.

715
0:35:52.595,000 --> 0:35:53,000
And by the way, that's not a one-off.

716
0:35:54.555,000 --> 0:35:55,000
If you read histories,

717
0:35:56.061,000 --> 0:36:,000
you see these periods of collapse and clash and fighting,

718
0:36:00.482,000 --> 0:36:02,000
followed by these periods of --

719
0:36:03.125,000 --> 0:36:05,000
You know, you construct the balance sheets,

720
0:36:05.76,000 --> 0:36:07,000
you change the system and then you begin a new system

721
0:36:08.736,000 --> 0:36:1,000
and you come back and you work together.

722
0:36:10.95,000 --> 0:36:13,000
And then I'm seeing, around me,

723
0:36:14.431,000 --> 0:36:17,000
children in school and education systems in poor neighborhoods

724
0:36:18.4,000 --> 0:36:19,000
are sharing --

725
0:36:20.639,000 --> 0:36:21,000
They don't have adequate resources.

726
0:36:22.45,000 --> 0:36:23,000
There's no excuse.

727
0:36:24.704,000 --> 0:36:29,000
And so the idea that the profit system can accomplish everything

728
0:36:30.595,000 --> 0:36:32,000
is not right.

729
0:36:33.458,000 --> 0:36:37,000
Because resource allocation goes to those who have the resource.

730
0:36:38.266,000 --> 0:36:4,000
And so throughout all history,

731
0:36:40.335,000 --> 0:36:42,000
you go back hundreds of years,

732
0:36:42.466,000 --> 0:36:43,000
you see that any system

733
0:36:44.228,000 --> 0:36:47,000
works for those who tend to control the system.

734
0:36:48.204,000 --> 0:36:5,000
So let's say we have a capitalist system,

735
0:36:51.196,000 --> 0:36:52,000
and we have entrepreneurs,

736
0:36:53.145,000 --> 0:36:56,000
and you acquire money, and all that.

737
0:36:56.855,000 --> 0:36:59,000
And then, working with those in government,

738
0:36:59.953,000 --> 0:37:02,000
and they have a symbiotic relationship

739
0:37:03.048,000 --> 0:37:04,000
and it works well for them.

740
0:37:04.39,000 --> 0:37:05,000
So it's self-perpetuating,

741
0:37:06.113,000 --> 0:37:1,000
because the education of those who are those,

742
0:37:10.267,000 --> 0:37:13,000
is better than the education of those who aren't those.

743
0:37:13.45,000 --> 0:37:14,000
So, for example,

744
0:37:15.442,000 --> 0:37:19,000
in our system, those in the top 40 percent

745
0:37:20.044,000 --> 0:37:25,000
on average, spend five times as much money on their children's education

746
0:37:25.679,000 --> 0:37:27,000
than those who are in the bottom 60 percent.

747
0:37:28.22,000 --> 0:37:3,000
And so it becomes self-perpetuating.

748
0:37:31.038,000 --> 0:37:32,000
And so when I look at that,

749
0:37:32.657,000 --> 0:37:33,000
I'm saying, "I'm a capitalist,

750
0:37:34.641,000 --> 0:37:37,000
please understand, I'm a capitalist, I believe in the system,

751
0:37:37.942,000 --> 0:37:4,000
I believe you can increase the size of the pie

752
0:37:41.006,000 --> 0:37:42,000
and you can divide it well,

753
0:37:42.53,000 --> 0:37:44,000
and if we talk about how to do that effectively,

754
0:37:45.173,000 --> 0:37:46,000
we need to do it."

755
0:37:46.368,000 --> 0:37:49,000
But there comes a time that there needs reforms.

756
0:37:49.569,000 --> 0:37:52,000
And those reforms have to create productivity.

757
0:37:52.927,000 --> 0:37:54,000
It doesn't mean just give money away.

758
0:37:55.117,000 --> 0:37:58,000
It means, how do you make those people productive,

759
0:37:58.149,000 --> 0:38:01,000
so that they're also psychologically productive

760
0:38:01.6,000 --> 0:38:02,000
as well as physically productive

761
0:38:03.601,000 --> 0:38:04,000
and producing output.

762
0:38:05.045,000 --> 0:38:06,000
You need to do that system.

763
0:38:06.466,000 --> 0:38:08,000
And so for reasons I wrote on that page,

764
0:38:09.315,000 --> 0:38:1,000
that post --

765
0:38:11.045,000 --> 0:38:12,000
it's on LinkedIn if people want it --

766
0:38:13.061,000 --> 0:38:14,000
that you need to restructure it.

767
0:38:14.91,000 --> 0:38:16,000
Now we are restructuring it, OK?

768
0:38:17.823,000 --> 0:38:21,000
It's the inevitable consequence of what we're doing here.

769
0:38:22.458,000 --> 0:38:23,000
We will come out of that.

770
0:38:23.696,000 --> 0:38:25,000
There has been a tremendous transfer of wealth,

771
0:38:25.911,000 --> 0:38:26,000
whether people realize it or not,

772
0:38:27.649,000 --> 0:38:3,000
through the production of all of that borrowed money.

773
0:38:31.542,000 --> 0:38:32,000
And all of that producing of money,

774
0:38:33.415,000 --> 0:38:34,000
that is a big force.

775
0:38:35.431,000 --> 0:38:36,000
We will come out of here,

776
0:38:36.669,000 --> 0:38:39,000
and the thing we will talk about over the next couple of years,

777
0:38:40.632,000 --> 0:38:42,000
and probably sooner rather than later,

778
0:38:43.085,000 --> 0:38:45,000
is how we do that restructuring.

779
0:38:45.26,000 --> 0:38:48,000
And my worry now is the same as my worry then.

780
0:38:48.914,000 --> 0:38:52,000
Whether that will be done in a civil, bipartisan way

781
0:38:53.105,000 --> 0:38:56,000
that will both increase the size of the pie

782
0:38:56.367,000 --> 0:38:57,000
and divide it well,

783
0:38:57.59,000 --> 0:38:59,000
rather than damage the economy,

784
0:38:59.996,000 --> 0:39:01,000
because you lose productivity.

785
0:39:02.242,000 --> 0:39:04,000
There are certain things that are great investments,

786
0:39:04.711,000 --> 0:39:06,000
education is a great investment.

787
0:39:06.766,000 --> 0:39:09,000
The more people you have that are well-educated,

788
0:39:09.887,000 --> 0:39:11,000
and you have equal education,

789
0:39:11.958,000 --> 0:39:12,000
the more people you are going to have

790
0:39:13.816,000 --> 0:39:15,000
who have the chance to compete with each other,

791
0:39:16.744,000 --> 0:39:18,000
and raise that over a period of time.

792
0:39:18.934,000 --> 0:39:2,000
It's a hell of an investment.

793
0:39:21.379,000 --> 0:39:25,000
It will produce more productivity than it ever will cost,

794
0:39:25.678,000 --> 0:39:26,000
if it's done well.

795
0:39:27.019,000 --> 0:39:28,000
But what happens is,

796
0:39:28.432,000 --> 0:39:32,000
states and localities think of it as a budget item.

797
0:39:32.543,000 --> 0:39:33,000
So they look at expenses.

798
0:39:34.123,000 --> 0:39:36,000
And they penny-pinch on the education.

799
0:39:36.556,000 --> 0:39:39,000
Because if you're in a rich town, your kids will get a good education.

800
0:39:40.238,000 --> 0:39:41,000
And if you're not --

801
0:39:41.437,000 --> 0:39:43,000
And a large percentage of the population is losing that.

802
0:39:44.095,000 --> 0:39:45,000
So that has to be engineered well,

803
0:39:45.977,000 --> 0:39:47,000
so that they are productive,

804
0:39:48.199,000 --> 0:39:5,000
as well as divide the pie well,

805
0:39:50.62,000 --> 0:39:53,000
and everybody believes that the system is fair.

806
0:39:54.064,000 --> 0:39:55,000
We can get there.

807
0:39:55.778,000 --> 0:39:57,000
Am I optimistic that we will get there?

808
0:39:58.188,000 --> 0:39:59,000
You know, I don't know.

809
0:39:59.371,000 --> 0:40:01,000
I would say, I'm 60-40 pessimistic

810
0:40:01.902,000 --> 0:40:03,000
that we'll be good enough with each other to do that.

811
0:40:04.886,000 --> 0:40:05,000
But there's that possibility.

812
0:40:06.863,000 --> 0:40:07,000
This is our test.

813
0:40:08.434,000 --> 0:40:09,000
This is our stress test.

814
0:40:12.236,000 --> 0:40:14,000
CA: Ray, there's so much interest in this question

815
0:40:15.118,000 --> 0:40:18,000
of how we emerge from this,

816
0:40:18.22,000 --> 0:40:21,000
whether it's genuinely possible to rebuild the economy

817
0:40:21.706,000 --> 0:40:22,000
in a way that's fairer.

818
0:40:23.331,000 --> 0:40:26,000
I just want to read one last question, this one's from my Twitter feed.

819
0:40:27.243,000 --> 0:40:29,000
"Do you think that the current crisis

820
0:40:29.482,000 --> 0:40:33,000
is showing that low-paid and/or unskilled workers

821
0:40:33.633,000 --> 0:40:35,000
are what holds countries together,

822
0:40:36.127,000 --> 0:40:38,000
even more so than banks and hedge funds?

823
0:40:39.135,000 --> 0:40:41,000
And if so, as part of the rebuilding,

824
0:40:41.675,000 --> 0:40:45,000
can we build an economy that raises their interest higher?"

825
0:40:48.382,000 --> 0:40:49,000
RD: Those --

826
0:40:50.191,000 --> 0:40:53,000
The heroes are those kind of people.

827
0:40:54.256,000 --> 0:40:55,000
OK, really.

828
0:40:56.375,000 --> 0:40:59,000
But it takes everyone, OK?

829
0:41:00.331,000 --> 0:41:05,000
It takes the efficient allocation of resources for --

830
0:41:06.601,000 --> 0:41:08,000
As you probably have seen behind the scenes,

831
0:41:09.442,000 --> 0:41:13,000
we see those who control a lot of resources

832
0:41:13.569,000 --> 0:41:15,000
being able to make contributions.

833
0:41:15.927,000 --> 0:41:19,000
We're giving 60,000 computers to poor students,

834
0:41:20.703,000 --> 0:41:22,000
so that they can learn.

835
0:41:22.768,000 --> 0:41:26,000
You know, the difference between a rich and a poor student

836
0:41:26.965,000 --> 0:41:29,000
is having a computer and having the ability to learn.

837
0:41:30.48,000 --> 0:41:34,000
And I want to thank those who would be embarrassed

838
0:41:35.427,000 --> 0:41:36,000
and almost afraid to hear it

839
0:41:37.14,000 --> 0:41:39,000
of how they contributed to that process.

840
0:41:39.72,000 --> 0:41:42,000
And at the same time, those other people,

841
0:41:43.086,000 --> 0:41:46,000
who are every day serving in so many ways,

842
0:41:46.99,000 --> 0:41:5,000
so it's good character and it's that --

843
0:41:51.314,000 --> 0:41:53,000
You know, when people came back from war,

844
0:41:53.339,000 --> 0:41:55,000
they built the greatest generation.

845
0:41:55.403,000 --> 0:41:59,000
It's that type of character that brings our country together,

846
0:41:59.918,000 --> 0:42:02,000
but each has to recognize their roles in doing that.

847
0:42:03.903,000 --> 0:42:05,000
So there's a CEO

848
0:42:06.013,000 --> 0:42:08,000
and then there's somebody who's really a great hero

849
0:42:08.833,000 --> 0:42:09,000
on the front lines,

850
0:42:10.402,000 --> 0:42:13,000
and they better damn work well together, so yeah.

851
0:42:14.141,000 --> 0:42:16,000
And then, they have to have usefulness.

852
0:42:17.315,000 --> 0:42:18,000
And we've got to appreciate them.

853
0:42:18.934,000 --> 0:42:22,000
We have to establish -- just the reality, I think --

854
0:42:23.212,000 --> 0:42:27,000
that there is a level of basics.

855
0:42:27.371,000 --> 0:42:29,000
Basic education,

856
0:42:30.332,000 --> 0:42:33,000
basic health care --

857
0:42:34.172,000 --> 0:42:37,000
Basics that you cannot fall below.

858
0:42:38.469,000 --> 0:42:39,000
OK?

859
0:42:39.644,000 --> 0:42:42,000
Otherwise, when you go below that level,

860
0:42:42.969,000 --> 0:42:43,000
there is no opportunity,

861
0:42:44.636,000 --> 0:42:46,000
and actually, the costliness of it,

862
0:42:47.276,000 --> 0:42:5,000
in the form of crimes and incarceration.

863
0:42:50.323,000 --> 0:42:52,000
Like, to bring it personal,

864
0:42:52.53,000 --> 0:42:55,000
our mission is to help high school kids

865
0:42:56.454,000 --> 0:42:58,000
who dropped out of high school and can have jobs,

866
0:42:59.335,000 --> 0:43:01,000
to get them in that high school and through that, in jobs.

867
0:43:02.303,000 --> 0:43:05,000
And we believe that we can do that and save a lot of money,

868
0:43:05.855,000 --> 0:43:11,000
because the average cost of incarceration,

869
0:43:12.204,000 --> 0:43:16,000
it goes from about 40,000 dollars a year up to 120,000 dollars a year,

870
0:43:16.668,000 --> 0:43:17,000
depending on the form.

871
0:43:18.041,000 --> 0:43:21,000
And if you get them in and move them into a job,

872
0:43:21.613,000 --> 0:43:22,000
you're going to save a lot of money,

873
0:43:23.405,000 --> 0:43:24,000
and we could do that cost-effectively.

874
0:43:25.356,000 --> 0:43:28,000
But philanthropists can't do this alone.

875
0:43:28.911,000 --> 0:43:29,000
The amount of money is enormous.

876
0:43:30.617,000 --> 0:43:34,000
So if our country did those kinds of things, I think ...

877
0:43:35.942,000 --> 0:43:36,000
I think it would be great.

878
0:43:39.694,000 --> 0:43:4,000
CA: Wow, thank you for that, Ray.

879
0:43:41.384,000 --> 0:43:42,000
Corey, what do you think?

880
0:43:43.091,000 --> 0:43:46,000
Have you got any other questions there before we wrap up?

881
0:43:46.924,000 --> 0:43:47,000
CH: No, I think we're good,

882
0:43:48.409,000 --> 0:43:5,000
I mean, I think we're going to get through it,

883
0:43:50.927,000 --> 0:43:51,000
I guess is what we're saying,

884
0:43:52.498,000 --> 0:43:54,000
but we also have an opportunity here

885
0:43:55.284,000 --> 0:43:58,000
to make some changes and do better and emerge stronger.

886
0:43:58.46,000 --> 0:43:59,000
And as you said,

887
0:43:59.697,000 --> 0:44:02,000
take a look at things and the structures that we have in place

888
0:44:02.721,000 --> 0:44:03,000
and see where we can improve,

889
0:44:04.372,000 --> 0:44:08,000
but it's going to take a collective action and cooperation.

890
0:44:09.894,000 --> 0:44:1,000
CA: Yeah, Ray, I'm definitely inspired

891
0:44:11.735,000 --> 0:44:15,000
by the actions that you're taking as a philanthropist

892
0:44:16.101,000 --> 0:44:17,000
in this moment.

893
0:44:17.855,000 --> 0:44:18,000
And some of your peers,

894
0:44:19.569,000 --> 0:44:21,000
you know, there are amazing stories out there.

895
0:44:21.784,000 --> 0:44:23,000
I was really struck by Jack Dorsey's announcement yesterday

896
0:44:24.594,000 --> 0:44:26,000
of his huge philanthropic contribution.

897
0:44:26.815,000 --> 0:44:31,000
And, I mean, that's awesome, but equally important, I was --

898
0:44:31.84,000 --> 0:44:32,000
RD: But it's not nearly enough.

899
0:44:33.442,000 --> 0:44:34,000
CA: Exactly, and I'm --

900
0:44:34.807,000 --> 0:44:35,000
CH: It would be good to see more.

901
0:44:36.593,000 --> 0:44:38,000
CA: I'm kind of dismayed, in a way,

902
0:44:39.45,000 --> 0:44:42,000
to hear you say that you're 60/40 leaning pessimistic,

903
0:44:42.569,000 --> 0:44:44,000
like, it feels like your voice

904
0:44:45.27,000 --> 0:44:48,000
in these conversations that are going on in the corridors of power

905
0:44:48.445,000 --> 0:44:5,000
and you know, where the big money is,

906
0:44:51.302,000 --> 0:44:55,000
around whether this turns into fundamentally, cooperation

907
0:44:55.434,000 --> 0:44:57,000
between countries and between companies

908
0:44:58.4,000 --> 0:45:01,000
and between, you know, big-money controllers,

909
0:45:02.157,000 --> 0:45:05,000
or whether it turns into a fistfight,

910
0:45:05.506,000 --> 0:45:06,000
is so important.

911
0:45:06.879,000 --> 0:45:08,000
And hearing you talk about the gratitude

912
0:45:09.641,000 --> 0:45:12,000
we should be feeling towards some aspects, let's say,

913
0:45:13.162,000 --> 0:45:14,000
of what China has done,

914
0:45:15.035,000 --> 0:45:16,000
the extent --

915
0:45:16.368,000 --> 0:45:18,000
Do you find yourself in conversations,

916
0:45:18.398,000 --> 0:45:2,000
like, raising this, trying to take the view that,

917
0:45:21.043,000 --> 0:45:25,000
"No, no, no, you're needlessly sparking friction here,

918
0:45:25.157,000 --> 0:45:27,000
take a more generous view"?

919
0:45:27.252,000 --> 0:45:29,000
Because it feels to me like there's so much at stake

920
0:45:29.713,000 --> 0:45:31,000
between how many people are trying to nudge

921
0:45:32.72,000 --> 0:45:33,000
that type of conversation

922
0:45:34.419,000 --> 0:45:38,000
versus the hostile, fearful conversation.

923
0:45:39.505,000 --> 0:45:44,000
RD: I think there's a general mistaken belief --

924
0:45:45.278,000 --> 0:45:47,000
I communicate a lot with the people that you're saying,

925
0:45:48.271,000 --> 0:45:5,000
people in positions of power,

926
0:45:51.096,000 --> 0:45:55,000
whether they're both in government or other places, and so on.

927
0:45:55.149,000 --> 0:45:57,000
I think what you basically have to realize

928
0:45:57.802,000 --> 0:46:01,000
is that very few people are making decisions

929
0:46:01.937,000 --> 0:46:05,000
based on the quality of the argument.

930
0:46:06.866,000 --> 0:46:08,000
That most people are --

931
0:46:09.749,000 --> 0:46:13,000
Most of those are in a war of some kind

932
0:46:14.131,000 --> 0:46:16,000
or have a particular objective.

933
0:46:17.034,000 --> 0:46:2,000
And that the information that comes out,

934
0:46:20.129,000 --> 0:46:23,000
even in the media --

935
0:46:23.43,000 --> 0:46:27,000
you know, you could almost see which side each media outlet

936
0:46:27.539,000 --> 0:46:28,000
or each person is on.

937
0:46:29.427,000 --> 0:46:32,000
How many people do you really believe

938
0:46:33.442,000 --> 0:46:34,000
don't have a side?

939
0:46:35.506,000 --> 0:46:37,000
Almost everybody has --

940
0:46:37.792,000 --> 0:46:39,000
they're on one side or another side.

941
0:46:40.561,000 --> 0:46:43,000
And the idea of being able to see things from both sides

942
0:46:43.736,000 --> 0:46:44,000
and come together,

943
0:46:45.276,000 --> 0:46:49,000
is, in this time and through history,

944
0:46:49.307,000 --> 0:46:51,000
perceived as almost being weak

945
0:46:52.252,000 --> 0:46:53,000
or a threat.

946
0:46:54.641,000 --> 0:46:57,000
Because you've got to get on one side or the other side

947
0:46:58.395,000 --> 0:46:59,000
and so on.

948
0:46:59.578,000 --> 0:47:03,000
And so it's not easy to just say --

949
0:47:04.542,000 --> 0:47:08,000
Like, all the people, and China for example, I would say,

950
0:47:08.625,000 --> 0:47:09,000
"Thank you very much,"

951
0:47:09.855,000 --> 0:47:13,000
you know how many respirators and masks and all these things

952
0:47:14.119,000 --> 0:47:15,000
that have come?

953
0:47:15.307,000 --> 0:47:17,000
But almost that's politically challenging.

954
0:47:17.441,000 --> 0:47:19,000
Because there will be people out there,

955
0:47:19.496,000 --> 0:47:21,000
and threatening, why am I doing this?

956
0:47:22.129,000 --> 0:47:24,000
People will be out there and they will say,

957
0:47:24.449,000 --> 0:47:27,000
"OK, he's a China lover" or "he's an enemy,"

958
0:47:28.403,000 --> 0:47:29,000
"he goes on the other side."

959
0:47:30.26,000 --> 0:47:33,000
Because there will be people on the other sides, and those people --

960
0:47:33.784,000 --> 0:47:35,000
And so I think I'll turn to you, Chris.

961
0:47:36.777,000 --> 0:47:37,000
You have a forum.

962
0:47:38.206,000 --> 0:47:41,000
Bring in the other sides, OK?

963
0:47:41.261,000 --> 0:47:44,000
Bring in those that are those who,

964
0:47:44.427,000 --> 0:47:47,000
let's say, have the most offensive policies that you think

965
0:47:48.022,000 --> 0:47:49,000
that are in positions of power.

966
0:47:49.68,000 --> 0:47:5,000
And have that together,

967
0:47:50.911,000 --> 0:47:53,000
so that you can have thoughtful disagreement.

968
0:47:54.613,000 --> 0:47:57,000
I'm a believer in thoughtful disagreement.

969
0:47:58.518,000 --> 0:47:59,000
Open, thoughtful disagreement

970
0:48:00.192,000 --> 0:48:02,000
to try to get at the right answer and have collectiveness.

971
0:48:02.946,000 --> 0:48:04,000
But it isn't easy in this world.

972
0:48:07.186,000 --> 0:48:08,000
CA: Well, that's a good challenge to us,

973
0:48:09.163,000 --> 0:48:12,000
and I'm also a believer in [thoughtful] disagreement,

974
0:48:12.187,000 --> 0:48:14,000
I think, Corey, we're passionate disbelievers

975
0:48:15.173,000 --> 0:48:19,000
in the spreading of irrational hatred.

976
0:48:20.148,000 --> 0:48:21,000
Like, instinctual irrational hatred

977
0:48:21.852,000 --> 0:48:25,000
and I feel like the stakes are so high right now, that if --

978
0:48:27.371,000 --> 0:48:29,000
RD: But will you fight for that?

979
0:48:29.942,000 --> 0:48:3,000
In other words,

980
0:48:31.117,000 --> 0:48:34,000
when somebody's going to punch back --

981
0:48:35.07,000 --> 0:48:36,000
Because this is what's needed.

982
0:48:36.911,000 --> 0:48:37,000
If somebody's going to punch back

983
0:48:38.895,000 --> 0:48:4,000
because you're saying something that's true

984
0:48:41.673,000 --> 0:48:44,000
and controversial,

985
0:48:44.969,000 --> 0:48:45,000
that will be the test --

986
0:48:46.214,000 --> 0:48:5,000
Can you punch back for collective, you know,

987
0:48:50.364,000 --> 0:48:51,000
decision-making comment,

988
0:48:51.757,000 --> 0:48:53,000
decision making and then punch back?

989
0:48:54.934,000 --> 0:48:57,000
CA: I'm not going to say punch, I'm going to say fight back, absolutely.

990
0:48:58.657,000 --> 0:48:59,000
RD: OK, fight back, that's good.

991
0:49:00.673,000 --> 0:49:01,000
CA: With every fiber we have.

992
0:49:02.143,000 --> 0:49:05,000
If it means that we look weak or we're a threat, so damn well be it,

993
0:49:05.399,000 --> 0:49:07,000
because you know, this is the moment.

994
0:49:08.277,000 --> 0:49:1,000
I mean, everyone is impacting everyone else.

995
0:49:11.117,000 --> 0:49:14,000
We have a shot to nudge each other to be our better selves.

996
0:49:14.474,000 --> 0:49:16,000
And to look at the stories of inspiration,

997
0:49:17.232,000 --> 0:49:19,000
the stories of humans reaching out to humans,

998
0:49:19.823,000 --> 0:49:21,000
of companies doing incredible things,

999
0:49:21.925,000 --> 0:49:23,000
letting go of the profit motive for a moment,

1000
0:49:24.268,000 --> 0:49:26,000
of countries trying to help each other --

1001
0:49:27.221,000 --> 0:49:28,000
there are stories about that.

1002
0:49:28.682,000 --> 0:49:32,000
I think we need to amplify some of those stories more.

1003
0:49:32.864,000 --> 0:49:33,000
And we're certainly down to do that.

1004
0:49:34.634,000 --> 0:49:35,000
We're trying to do that every day.

1005
0:49:36.333,000 --> 0:49:4,000
And Ray, I loved hearing you talk about some of the good things

1006
0:49:41.078,000 --> 0:49:43,000
that China is doing, all the rest of it.

1007
0:49:43.546,000 --> 0:49:45,000
Thank you for your voice and for spending this time

1008
0:49:46.041,000 --> 0:49:49,000
and for being, you know, honest and vigorous with us.

1009
0:49:51.037,000 --> 0:49:52,000
And thank you, everyone, for listening.

1010
0:49:52.95,000 --> 0:49:53,000
RD: I appreciate it.

1011
0:49:54.125,000 --> 0:49:55,000
CA: A big damn deal.

1012
0:49:55.302,000 --> 0:49:57,000
If you're listening, it sounded like you just got a warning

1013
0:49:58.18,000 --> 0:50:01,000
that this could be a multiyear recession, depression.

1014
0:50:01.63,000 --> 0:50:06,000
That's scary, and more than ever, we need to be in this together,

1015
0:50:07.178,000 --> 0:50:09,000
as we've said again and again.

1016
0:50:09.284,000 --> 0:50:14,000
RD: Well, in conclusion, -- I know we're wrapping up --

1017
0:50:14.823,000 --> 0:50:16,000
yes, I believe this is a defining moment,

1018
0:50:17.375,000 --> 0:50:19,000
we will get through it fine,

1019
0:50:19.47,000 --> 0:50:22,000
we will be restructured in important ways.

1020
0:50:23.875,000 --> 0:50:24,000
So that's fine.

1021
0:50:25.561,000 --> 0:50:29,000
And thank you for, you know,

1022
0:50:30.196,000 --> 0:50:32,000
sharing ideas worth considering, you know.

1023
0:50:35.173,000 --> 0:50:36,000
CA: Thank you, Ray.

1024
0:50:36.442,000 --> 0:50:37,000
Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

1025
0:50:38.395,000 --> 0:50:41,000
Corey, we've still got more days to the week.

1026
0:50:41.616,000 --> 0:50:44,000
There's an amazing program tomorrow,

1027
0:50:45.419,000 --> 0:50:48,000
we're going to take a much more global look there

1028
0:50:49.244,000 --> 0:50:51,000
that I'm superexcited about.

1029
0:50:51.841,000 --> 0:50:53,000
We have a report from the head of LabourNet,

1030
0:50:54.077,000 --> 0:50:58,000
which is an organization in India looking at mobile workers

1031
0:50:58.379,000 --> 0:51:,000
who just are facing this horrific situation right now,

1032
0:51:01.228,000 --> 0:51:04,000
where they're having to, in the lockdown,

1033
0:51:04.436,000 --> 0:51:06,000
having to maybe walk home hundreds of miles,

1034
0:51:06.515,000 --> 0:51:08,000
or face police action.

1035
0:51:09.49,000 --> 0:51:11,000
We've got a report right from the front lines there

1036
0:51:11.921,000 --> 0:51:12,000
as to what that's like

1037
0:51:13.173,000 --> 0:51:15,000
in a country with a very different set of trade-offs

1038
0:51:15.641,000 --> 0:51:16,000
they're having to make between lockdown

1039
0:51:17.609,000 --> 0:51:21,000
and giving the most impoverished a chance.

1040
0:51:21.791,000 --> 0:51:25,000
And then, a wide-ranging discussion with Fareed Zakaria,

1041
0:51:26.68,000 --> 0:51:29,000
who, you know, has this global view --

1042
0:51:29.784,000 --> 0:51:3,000
you will have seen him on CNN --

1043
0:51:31.482,000 --> 0:51:34,000
he's got this very broad-ranging global view

1044
0:51:35.498,000 --> 0:51:37,000
as to how to think about this thing.

1045
0:51:37.735,000 --> 0:51:4,000
And to compare the different responses of different countries.

1046
0:51:41.442,000 --> 0:51:43,000
I think it's going to be an amazing conversation,

1047
0:51:43.792,000 --> 0:51:45,000
I urge you to come back for that.

1048
0:51:46.562,000 --> 0:51:47,000
CH: It's so amazing --

1049
0:51:48.402,000 --> 0:51:51,000
you know, we were talking about this in a meeting this morning --

1050
0:51:51.474,000 --> 0:51:54,000
this is a crisis that the whole world is going through together,

1051
0:51:54.637,000 --> 0:51:56,000
and I think that's what's so unusual about it

1052
0:51:56.823,000 --> 0:51:59,000
and there's so much to dig into,

1053
0:52:00.195,000 --> 0:52:03,000
so much to learn about how it's affecting everybody in different ways.

1054
0:52:03.545,000 --> 0:52:04,000
So I'm glad we're continuing.

1055
0:52:07.132,000 --> 0:52:08,000
CA: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Ray.

1056
0:52:09.103,000 --> 0:52:12,000
And you can see a recording of this, if you didn't [see] the whole thing,

1057
0:52:12.95,000 --> 0:52:18,000
by going, I think it's to go.ted.com/tedconnects.

1058
0:52:19.911,000 --> 0:52:23,000
And if you want to look at Ray's work on this,

1059
0:52:24.584,000 --> 0:52:25,000
just google Ray Dalio LinkedIn,

1060
0:52:26.441,000 --> 0:52:29,000
and there's a whole series of resources there.

1061
0:52:29.544,000 --> 0:52:31,000
That's "Dalio" with one "L."

1062
0:52:31.77,000 --> 0:52:32,000
Ray, thank you so much for this.

1063
0:52:33.54,000 --> 0:52:35,000
This was really, really, really interesting.

1064
0:52:35.992,000 --> 0:52:36,000
Thank you so much. Thanks, all.

1065
0:52:37.508,000 --> 0:52:38,000
CH: Thank you.

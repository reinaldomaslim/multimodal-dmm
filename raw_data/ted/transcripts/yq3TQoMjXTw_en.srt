2
0:00:16.066,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Okay, this morning I'm speaking

3
0:00:17.841,000 --> 0:00:2,000
on the question of corruption.

4
0:00:21.03,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And corruption is defined

5
0:00:23.19,000 --> 0:00:28,000
as the abuse of a position of trust

6
0:00:28.926,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for the benefit of yourself -- or, in the case of our context,

7
0:00:32.566,000 --> 0:00:34,000
your friends, your family or your financiers.

8
0:00:35.189,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Okay? Friends, family and financiers.

9
0:00:39.712,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But we need to understand what we understand about corruption,

10
0:00:43.727,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and we need to understand that

11
0:00:46.525,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.

12
0:00:49.874,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We have to have the courage to admit that

13
0:00:51.431,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to start changing how we deal with it.

14
0:00:53.876,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The first thing is that the big myth, number one,

15
0:00:56.799,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is that in fact it's not really a crime.

16
0:00:59.17,000 --> 0:01:,000
When we get together with friends and family

17
0:01:00.96,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and we discuss crime in our country,

18
0:01:02.839,000 --> 0:01:05,000
crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,

19
0:01:06.432,000 --> 0:01:07,000
nobody's speaking about corruption.

20
0:01:07.962,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That's the honest truth.

21
0:01:09.512,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,

22
0:01:12.549,000 --> 0:01:14,000
he isn't speaking about corruption.

23
0:01:14.559,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security

24
0:01:16.875,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.

25
0:01:20.75,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The point I'm making is that it is a crime.

26
0:01:23.365,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.

27
0:01:28.215,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Public and private corruption is a reality.

28
0:01:30.983,000 --> 0:01:31,000
As somebody who comes from the private sector,

29
0:01:32.714,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption

30
0:01:35.11,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the private sector that has nothing to do with government.

31
0:01:37.889,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,

32
0:01:40.731,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it all takes place in the private sector.

33
0:01:43.199,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,

34
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
which the private sector also participates in.

35
0:01:49.935,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The second important myth to understand --

36
0:01:52.231,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because we have to destroy these myths,

37
0:01:53.965,000 --> 0:01:55,000
dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --

38
0:01:56.425,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the second important myth to understand

39
0:01:58.371,000 --> 0:02:,000
is the one that says

40
0:02:00.863,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that in fact corruption is only a small problem --

41
0:02:04.132,000 --> 0:02:06,000
if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,

42
0:02:06.462,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,

43
0:02:10.156,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,

44
0:02:14.047,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.

45
0:02:17.831,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I want to demonstrate that that, too,

46
0:02:20.191,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

47
0:02:22.128,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's a piece of public mischief.

48
0:02:24.549,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And I want to speak a little bit,

49
0:02:27.143,000 --> 0:02:29,000
take us back about 30 years.

50
0:02:29.391,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,

51
0:02:31.385,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,

52
0:02:34.583,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,

53
0:02:39.629,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.

54
0:02:43.122,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.

55
0:02:46.157,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it's ironic, because

56
0:02:49.845,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we're standing today in the Central Bank.

57
0:02:51.883,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You see, history's rich in irony.

58
0:02:54.079,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We're standing today in the Central Bank,

59
0:02:55.901,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.

60
0:02:59.279,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.

61
0:03:02.604,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,

62
0:03:05.352,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,

63
0:03:07.391,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and there's a lot of connection with us today,

64
0:03:09.079,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?

65
0:03:11.929,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:16.829,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The first thing I want to talk about is that

67
0:03:19.071,000 --> 0:03:22,000
when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,

68
0:03:22.767,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we embarked, the government of the day embarked

69
0:03:24.854,000 --> 0:03:26,000
on a series of government-to-government arrangements

70
0:03:26.964,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to have rapidly develop the country.

71
0:03:28.998,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And some of the largest projects in the country

72
0:03:31.264,000 --> 0:03:34,000
were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements

73
0:03:34.462,000 --> 0:03:35,000
with some of the leading countries in the world,

74
0:03:36.278,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.

75
0:03:38.986,000 --> 0:03:41,000
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --

76
0:03:42.054,000 --> 0:03:43,000
this building was part of that series of complexes,

77
0:03:43.738,000 --> 0:03:47,000
what they called the Twin Towers.

78
0:03:47.846,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It became so outrageous, the whole situation,

79
0:03:50.806,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,

80
0:03:53.686,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported --

81
0:03:57.689,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago,

82
0:04:00.438,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.

83
0:04:04.374,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament

84
0:04:06.282,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.

85
0:04:09.479,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.

86
0:04:11.776,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It went right into my heart.

87
0:04:13.156,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.

88
0:04:17.913,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Are we getting a, yeah?—

89
0:04:20.39,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That's what he told us.

90
0:04:22.389,000 --> 0:04:26,000
He told us that, in fact,

91
0:04:26.529,000 --> 0:04:28,000
two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars

92
0:04:29.451,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we spent, the taxpayers' money,

93
0:04:31.835,000 --> 0:04:33,000
was wasted or stolen.

94
0:04:33.919,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.

95
0:04:37.962,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.

96
0:04:40.071,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's for little children. We are big people,

97
0:04:41.766,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.

98
0:04:44.553,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Okay? This is the size of the problem.

99
0:04:46.698,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.

100
0:04:49.71,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.

101
0:04:53.152,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So what has changed?

102
0:04:55.211,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets

103
0:04:56.898,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to an international audience, but I have to.

104
0:04:59.457,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

105
0:05:02.97,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,

106
0:05:07.868,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,

107
0:05:10.514,000 --> 0:05:11,000
a suspicious piece of law

108
0:05:11.869,000 --> 0:05:13,000
was passed at a suspicious time

109
0:05:14.012,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to free some suspects. (Laughter)

110
0:05:15.91,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it was called, those people are called

111
0:05:22.643,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the Piarco Airport accused.

112
0:05:24.217,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.

113
0:05:27.094,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They are the Piarco Airport accused.

114
0:05:28.921,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order,

115
0:05:31.814,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.

116
0:05:35.87,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Our highest institution in our country was perverted.

117
0:05:38.969,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We are dealing with perverts here

118
0:05:40.942,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of an economic and financial nature.

119
0:05:42.664,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Do you get how serious this problem is?

120
0:05:44.513,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room

121
0:05:46.623,000 --> 0:05:48,000
took part in the protest in different forms.

122
0:05:49.333,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Most importantly, the American embassy complained,

123
0:05:52.152,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so Parliament was swiftly reconvened,

124
0:05:54.639,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the law was reversed, it was repealed.

125
0:05:56.544,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.

126
0:05:58.491,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But the point is

127
0:06:01.608,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,

128
0:06:05.303,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because what really happened is that,

129
0:06:07.789,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because of the suspicious passage of that law,

130
0:06:10.863,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the law was actually passed into effect

131
0:06:13.184,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,

132
0:06:16.442,000 --> 0:06:17,000
our jubilee of independence.

133
0:06:18.002,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.

134
0:06:20.024,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,

135
0:06:23.435,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because we all understood it,

136
0:06:25.122,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and for the first time that I could remember,

137
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
there were mass protests against this corruption.

138
0:06:30.43,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?

139
0:06:32.621,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like

140
0:06:34.484,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.

141
0:06:37.853,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law

142
0:06:41.301,000 --> 0:06:44,000
fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.

143
0:06:45.277,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.

144
0:06:49.888,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But what were they accused of?

145
0:06:51.784,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What was it that they were accused of?

146
0:06:52.887,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?

147
0:06:56.166,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,

148
0:06:58.748,000 --> 0:07:,000
an airport that had grown outdated.

149
0:07:01.35,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,

150
0:07:05.14,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Trinidad and Tobago dollars,

151
0:07:07.707,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging

152
0:07:10.87,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.

153
0:07:14.057,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And to get an idea of what it consisted of,

154
0:07:18.147,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and to put it in context in relationship to this whole

155
0:07:21.027,000 --> 0:07:23,000
second myth about it being no big thing,

156
0:07:23.46,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we can look at this second slide here.

157
0:07:26.231,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And what we have here -- I am not saying so,

158
0:07:29.924,000 --> 0:07:33,000
this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.

159
0:07:34.731,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,

160
0:07:39.205,000 --> 0:07:41,000
one billion dollars has been traced

161
0:07:41.397,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to offshore bank accounts.

162
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money

163
0:07:45.323,000 --> 0:07:48,000
has been located in offshore bank accounts.

164
0:07:48.721,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Being the kind of suspicious person I am,

165
0:07:50.834,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,

166
0:07:53.551,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.

167
0:07:56.047,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw

168
0:07:57.861,000 --> 0:08:,000
in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.

169
0:08:01.605,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.

170
0:08:05.797,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I was walking around with the protesters

171
0:08:07.73,000 --> 0:08:11,000
looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.

172
0:08:12.023,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,

173
0:08:14.343,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a kind of battered-looking blonde lady,

174
0:08:16.767,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,

175
0:08:19.59,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it was made with a marker.

176
0:08:21.582,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.

177
0:08:24.103,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."

178
0:08:28.51,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.

179
0:08:31.492,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.

180
0:08:35.623,000 --> 0:08:37,000
My brain started thinking.

181
0:08:37.78,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Well, what if --

182
0:08:40.671,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.

183
0:08:43.877,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What if -- (Laughter)

184
0:08:45.555,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But to make it in these wrongs,

185
0:08:48.079,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you have to read a lot of spy novels

186
0:08:49.704,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)

187
0:08:52.271,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But what if this wasn't the first time?

188
0:08:56.838,000 --> 0:08:58,000
What if this is just the first time

189
0:08:59.425,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that the so-and-sos had been caught?

190
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What if it had happened before? How would I find out?

191
0:09:06.886,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now, the previous two examples I gave

192
0:09:09.376,000 --> 0:09:13,000
were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?

193
0:09:13.432,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I have the privilege at this time

194
0:09:15.463,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.

195
0:09:18.841,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders

196
0:09:22.438,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system

197
0:09:25.664,000 --> 0:09:27,000
about how public money is transacted.

198
0:09:27.824,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So those of you interested in finding out more about it,

199
0:09:30.029,000 --> 0:09:34,000
or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.

200
0:09:34.309,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,

201
0:09:36.568,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting

202
0:09:39.344,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for over three and a half years

203
0:09:41.68,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is for transparency and accountability

204
0:09:44.169,000 --> 0:09:47,000
around the bailout of CL Financial.

205
0:09:47.268,000 --> 0:09:52,000
CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?

206
0:09:52.269,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And without getting into all of the details,

207
0:09:55.192,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully —

208
0:09:58.208,000 --> 0:10:,000
it's said to have collapsed in January of '09,

209
0:10:01.035,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is just coming up to nearly four years.

210
0:10:04.713,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In an unprecedented fit of generosity --

211
0:10:07.525,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and you have to be very suspicious about these people --

212
0:10:10.008,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully —

213
0:10:12.639,000 --> 0:10:15,000
unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day

214
0:10:16.523,000 --> 0:10:19,000
signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.

215
0:10:20.178,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction

216
0:10:22.5,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.

217
0:10:25.682,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Let's understand, because we lack context.

218
0:10:27.593,000 --> 0:10:3,000
People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.

219
0:10:30.598,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.

220
0:10:35.087,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's not just like anywhere. (Applause)

221
0:10:39.831,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.

222
0:10:44.985,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?

223
0:10:47.816,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm serious now.

224
0:10:49.146,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.

225
0:10:52.129,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They've had bailouts in London.

226
0:10:54.08,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They've had bailouts in Europe.

227
0:10:56.217,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major

228
0:10:58.887,000 --> 0:11:,000
commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?

229
0:11:01.452,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --

230
0:11:03.693,000 --> 0:11:05,000
how they've treated it, and they've treated it

231
0:11:06.083,000 --> 0:11:07,000
very well compared to us.

232
0:11:07.954,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Nowhere on the planet

233
0:11:09.886,000 --> 0:11:11,000
have all the creditors been bailed out

234
0:11:12.592,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.

235
0:11:14.884,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?

236
0:11:18.466,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Is our government that generous? And maybe they are.

237
0:11:21.271,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Let's look at it. Let's look into it.

238
0:11:23.287,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So I started digging and writing and so and so on,

239
0:11:26.055,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and that work can be found, my personal work

240
0:11:27.867,000 --> 0:11:3,000
can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.

241
0:11:31.247,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.

242
0:11:34.119,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Not as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.

243
0:11:36.643,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:38.901,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,

245
0:11:43.39,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience

246
0:11:45.847,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that took place in August,

247
0:11:48.933,000 --> 0:11:5,000
when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,

248
0:11:51.831,000 --> 0:11:55,000
going into September, forced me to check myself

249
0:11:56.495,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and recalculate my bearings,

250
0:11:58.554,000 --> 0:12:,000
and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written

251
0:12:00.776,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials

252
0:12:03.045,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to see what was really what.

253
0:12:05.049,000 --> 0:12:09,000
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?

254
0:12:09.159,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Okay? We want to try to recalculate.

255
0:12:10.983,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I made a Freedom of Information application

256
0:12:13.407,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.

257
0:12:17.321,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.

258
0:12:19.379,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This is the other context.

259
0:12:21.054,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The Ministry of Finance, we are told,

260
0:12:23.13,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

261
0:12:26.959,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.

262
0:12:30.263,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning

263
0:12:33.151,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

264
0:12:37.348,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So in fact, you can't ask them anything,

265
0:12:39.027,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and they don't have to answer anything.

266
0:12:40.72,000 --> 0:12:42,000
That is the law since 1999.

267
0:12:43.542,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.

268
0:12:47.118,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,

269
0:12:50.807,000 --> 0:12:52,000
so you could understand, as I said, where we are.

270
0:12:53.422,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Here is not like anywhere else.

271
0:12:54.943,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Question number one:

272
0:12:57.921,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,

273
0:13:00.511,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and if you can't show me the accounts --

274
0:13:02.983,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the Minister of Finance is making statements,

275
0:13:04.948,000 --> 0:13:06,000
passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.

276
0:13:07.563,000 --> 0:13:09,000
What are the figures he's relying on?

277
0:13:09.854,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.

278
0:13:12.474,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And they wrote back and said to me,

279
0:13:14.073,000 --> 0:13:15,000
well what do you really mean?

280
0:13:15.784,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So they hit my question with a question.

281
0:13:18.175,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Second point: I want to see

282
0:13:21.296,000 --> 0:13:24,000
who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?

283
0:13:24.995,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Let me pause here to point out to you all

284
0:13:26.999,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.

285
0:13:30.68,000 --> 0:13:32,000
That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars

286
0:13:33.079,000 --> 0:13:36,000
coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich --

287
0:13:36.575,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Caribbean country. Okay?

288
0:13:38.947,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And I asked the question,

289
0:13:40.495,000 --> 0:13:44,000
who was getting that three and a half billion dollars?

290
0:13:44.641,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I want to pause again to bring up context,

291
0:13:46.898,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.

292
0:13:50.301,000 --> 0:13:52,000
There's a particular individual who is in the government now.

293
0:13:52.871,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The name of the person doesn't matter.

294
0:13:54.591,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And that person made a career

295
0:13:57.143,000 --> 0:13:59,000
out of using the Freedom of Information Act

296
0:13:59.504,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to advance his political cause.

297
0:14:01.623,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Okay? His name isn't important.

298
0:14:04.866,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.

299
0:14:07.199,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The point is, that person made a career out of using

300
0:14:09.619,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.

301
0:14:12.583,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And the most famous case

302
0:14:14.897,000 --> 0:14:16,000
was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,

303
0:14:17.79,000 --> 0:14:19,000
where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money

304
0:14:20.679,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,

305
0:14:23.551,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.

306
0:14:26.275,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,

307
0:14:29.266,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Freedom of Information Act,

308
0:14:30.899,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to release the information,

309
0:14:32.876,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and I thought that was excellent.

310
0:14:36.241,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Fantastic.

311
0:14:39.407,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But you see, the question is this:

312
0:14:41.357,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act

313
0:14:45.57,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and to use the court

314
0:14:49.3,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,

315
0:14:54.042,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it must be right and proper

316
0:14:55.733,000 --> 0:14:59,000
for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.

317
0:14:59.874,000 --> 0:15:01,000
You see? But the Ministry of Finance,

318
0:15:02.462,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,

319
0:15:04.064,000 --> 0:15:07,000
wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.

320
0:15:07.121,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?

321
0:15:10.11,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The third thing I will tell you

322
0:15:12.244,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is that I also asked

323
0:15:15.249,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for the directors of CL Financial,

324
0:15:18.245,000 --> 0:15:22,000
whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.

325
0:15:22.59,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We have an Integrity in Public Life Act

326
0:15:24.208,000 --> 0:15:28,000
as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.

327
0:15:28.957,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And public officials are supposed to file

328
0:15:31.245,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.

329
0:15:37.71,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,

330
0:15:40.125,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.

331
0:15:43.004,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So here we have it. We have a situation where

332
0:15:47.921,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability

333
0:15:52.815,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and transparency have all been discarded.

334
0:15:54.808,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.

335
0:15:57.052,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It's been ignored.

336
0:15:59.54,000 --> 0:16:02,000
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,

337
0:16:02.715,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.

338
0:16:05.317,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.

339
0:16:08.915,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It's also the single largest example

340
0:16:11.496,000 --> 0:16:16,000
of public corruption according to this equation.

341
0:16:16.508,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And this is my reality check.

342
0:16:19.477,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Where you have an expenditure of public money

343
0:16:21.823,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and it is without accountability

344
0:16:24.778,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and it's without transparency,

345
0:16:26.418,000 --> 0:16:28,000
it will always be equal to corruption,

346
0:16:28.674,000 --> 0:16:31,000
whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,

347
0:16:31.879,000 --> 0:16:35,000
it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.

348
0:16:36.079,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I'm going to continue the work

349
0:16:38.39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
to press on, to get some resolution

350
0:16:42.736,000 --> 0:16:43,000
of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.

351
0:16:44.446,000 --> 0:16:46,000
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.

352
0:16:46.998,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We will continue to press on.

353
0:16:48.186,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We will continue to work within JCC.

354
0:16:50.137,000 --> 0:16:52,000
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context

355
0:16:52.838,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and bring something new to the table

356
0:16:54.757,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in terms of an international example.

357
0:16:56.583,000 --> 0:16:58,000
We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking

358
0:16:59.484,000 --> 0:17:01,000
about her battle against government corruption,

359
0:17:01.801,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.

360
0:17:07.238,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database

361
0:17:11.908,000 --> 0:17:13,000
for Freedom of Information applications,

362
0:17:14.687,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and speak with each other.

363
0:17:16.803,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I could see what you're applying for.

364
0:17:19.04,000 --> 0:17:22,000
You could see what I applied for and what replies I got.

365
0:17:22.572,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database

366
0:17:25.508,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.

367
0:17:28.812,000 --> 0:17:29,000
We need to increase the consciousness.

368
0:17:30.452,000 --> 0:17:34,000
The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,

369
0:17:34.506,000 --> 0:17:35,000
which is a lovely website from India

370
0:17:36.284,000 --> 0:17:38,000
called IPaidABribe.com.

371
0:17:38.726,000 --> 0:17:39,000
They have international branches,

372
0:17:40.512,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and it's important for us to tune into this one.

373
0:17:42.956,000 --> 0:17:44,000
IPaidABribe.com is really important,

374
0:17:45.412,000 --> 0:17:47,000
a good one to log on to and see.

375
0:17:47.828,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.

376
0:17:50.455,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Discard the first myth; it is a crime.

377
0:17:52.676,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Discard the second myth; it is a big thing.

378
0:17:54.994,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.

379
0:17:57.492,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And let us continue working together

380
0:17:59.54,000 --> 0:18:,000
to betterment in this situation,

381
0:18:01.007,000 --> 0:18:04,000
stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.

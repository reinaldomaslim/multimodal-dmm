1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"People protect what they love,"

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that's the incredible number and variety

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of animals in it that make light.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Right after I completed my Ph.D.,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that was using it for the first time

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as a tool for ocean exploration.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then my first open ocean dive

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
was in Santa Barbara Channel.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It was an evening dive.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I went down to a depth of 880 feet

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and turned out the lights.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
this phenomenon of animals making light

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
called bioluminescence.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But I was totally unprepared

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
for how much there was

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and how spectacular it was.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that were longer than this room,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
pumping out so much light

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that I could read the dials and gauges

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
inside the suit without a flashlight;

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and puffs and billows

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of what looked like luminous blue smoke;

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and explosions of sparks

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that would swirl up out of the thrusters --

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but these were icy, blue embers.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It was breathtaking.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it's these guys; it's fireflies.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
some insects, earthworms, fungi --

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but in general, on land, it's really rare.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In the ocean, it's the rule

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
rather than the exception.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
If I go out in the open ocean environment,

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
virtually anywhere in the world,

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
most of the animals --

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of the animals that I bring up in that net --

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
make light.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now I want to share with you a little video

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that I shot from a submersible.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I first developed this technique working from a little

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
single-person submersible called Deep Rover

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which you see here.

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
there's a a three-foot diameter hoop

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with a screen stretched across it.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
albeit a little fuzzy.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that's just electronic noise

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
on these super intensified cameras.

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
You don't see luminescence until the submersible

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
begins to move forward through the water,

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but as it does, animals bumping into the screen

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
are stimulated to bioluminesce.

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, when I was first doing this,

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,

76
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources

77
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
there were per cubic meter.

78
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
by the type of flashes they produced.

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
at 740 feet,

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Like those big explosions, sparks,

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are from a little comb jelly,

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and jellyfish.

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There was another one of those comb jellies.

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to develop automatic recognition systems

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that can identify these animals

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and do nearest neighbor distances.

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to see a light show like this.

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You can actually see it in surface waters.

97
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And this isn't someplace exotic

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because the heads on ships --

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are flushed with unfiltered seawater

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, if you stagger into the head late at night

108
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you're so toilet-hugging sick

109
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that you forget to turn on the light,

110
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, how does a living creature make light?

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Well, that was the question that 19th century

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
French physiologist Raphael Dubois,

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
asked about this bioluminescent clam.

115
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the substrate, he called luciferin

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
after Lucifer the Lightbearer.

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In fact, most of the people

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
studying bioluminescence today

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
have proved so incredibly valuable

125
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for developing antibacterial agents,

126
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
cancer fighting drugs,

127
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
testing for the presence of life on Mars,

128
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
detecting pollutants in our waters --

129
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which is how we use it at ORCA.

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In 2008,

131
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

132
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
was awarded for work done

133
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
on a molecule called green fluorescent protein

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry

135
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of a jellyfish,

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,

137
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in terms of the impact that it has had

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
on cell biology and genetic engineering.

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Another thing all these molecules are telling us

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved

141
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times

142
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in evolutionary history,

143
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which is a clear indication

144
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
of how spectacularly important

145
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
this trait is for survival.

146
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So, what is it about bioluminescence

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that's so important to so many animals?

148
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators

149
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
by staying in the darkness,

150
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
light can still be very useful

151
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and that's find food,

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
attract a mate and avoid being eaten.

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So, for example, this fish

155
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
has a built-in headlight behind its eye

156
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that it can use for finding food

157
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or attracting a mate.

158
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head

159
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This fish actually has high beams.

161
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And this fish, which is one of my favorites,

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
has three headlights on each side of its head.

163
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, this one is blue,

164
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because evolution has selected

166
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
for the color that travels farthest through seawater

167
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in order to optimize communication.

168
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, most animals make blue light,

169
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and most animals can only see blue light,

170
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but this fish is a really fascinating exception

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because it has two red light organs.

172
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I have no idea why there's two,

173
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and that's something I want to solve some day --

174
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but not only can it see blue light,

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but it can see red light.

176
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope

177
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to be able to sneak up on animals

178
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that are blind to red light

179
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and be able to see them without being seen.

180
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's also got a little chin barbel here

181
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with a blue luminescent lure on it

182
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.

183
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.

184
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is another one of my favorite fish.

185
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure

186
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
on the end of a long fishing rod

187
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that it arches in front of the toothy jaw

188
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that gives the viperfish its name.

189
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The teeth on this fish are so long

190
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,

191
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it would actually impale its own brain.

192
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So instead, it slides in grooves

193
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
on the outside of the head.

194
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This is a Christmas tree of a fish;

195
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
everything on this fish lights up,

196
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it's not just that lure.

197
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's got a built-in flashlight.

198
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly

199
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that it uses for a type of camouflage

200
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that obliterates its shadow,

201
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,

202
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it makes itself disappear.

203
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's got light organs in the mouth,

204
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,

205
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,

206
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
all used for different things --

207
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
some of which we know about, some of which we don't.

208
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,

209
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing

210
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
my favorite topic with so many people.

211
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I do wish, with their budget,

212
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money

213
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,

214
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who could have told them that those are the eyes

215
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.

216
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.

217
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out

218
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in front of this living mousetrap

219
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of needle-sharp teeth

220
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.

221
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And this one has a lure

222
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.

223
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
was to attract different types of prey,

225
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but then stomach content analyses on these fish

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,

227
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
have revealed that

228
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
they all eat pretty much the same thing.

229
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure

230
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is how the male recognizes the female

231
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in the anglerfish world,

232
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because many of these males

233
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
are what are known as dwarf males.

234
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This little guy

235
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
has no visible means of self-support.

236
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He has no lure for attracting food

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
His only hope for existence on this planet

239
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is as a gigolo. (Laughter)

240
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He's got to find himself a babe

241
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and then he's got to latch on for life.

242
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So this little guy

243
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
has found himself this babe,

244
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and you will note that he's had the good sense

245
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.

246
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

247
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it,

248
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.

249
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
His flesh fuses with her flesh,

250
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
her bloodstream grows into his body,

251
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.

252
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

253
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.

254
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
She always knows where he is,

255
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and she doesn't have to be monogamous,

256
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because some of these females

257
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
come up with multiple males attached.

258
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.

259
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.

260
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water

261
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.

262
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This shrimp is actually

263
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
spewing light out of its mouth

264
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
like a fire breathing dragon

265
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in order to blind or distract this viperfish

266
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.

267
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:

268
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
There's jellyfish, there's squid,

269
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
there's a whole lot of different crustaceans,

270
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
there's even fish that can do this.

271
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder

272
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because it actually has a tube on its shoulder

273
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that can squirt out light.

274
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I was luck enough to capture one of these

275
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
when we were on a trawling expedition

276
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"

277
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for the deep portion of "Blue Planet."

278
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we were using a special trawling net

279
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
that we were able to bring these animals up alive.

280
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.

281
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So I'm holding it,

282
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,

283
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.

284
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But to me, what's shocking

285
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is not just the amount of light,

286
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.

287
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
For this fish, it's actually whole cells

288
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with nuclei and membranes.

289
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,

290
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and we have no idea why it does it --

291
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.

292
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, another form of defense

293
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is something called a burglar alarm --

294
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;

295
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the honking horn and flashing lights

296
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,

297
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the police that will come and take the burglar away --

298
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,

299
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
its only hope for escape may be

300
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier

301
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that will attack their attacker,

302
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
thereby affording them a chance for escape.

303
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This jellyfish, for example, has

304
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a spectacular bioluminescent display.

305
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
This is us chasing it in the submersible.

306
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.

307
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible

308
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,

309
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
bring it into the lab on the ship.

310
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And then to generate the display you're about to see,

311
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
all I did was touch it once per second

312
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick

313
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.

314
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.

315
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is an unbelievable light show.

316
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's this pinwheel of light,

317
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen

318
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.

319
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And I thought, "You know,

320
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that might actually make a pretty good lure."

321
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Because one of the things that's frustrated me

322
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
as a deep-sea explorer

323
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about

324
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because of the way we explore the ocean.

325
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean

326
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is we go out and drag nets behind ships.

327
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And I defy you to name any other branch of science

328
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.

329
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
The other primary way is we go down

330
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.

331
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.

332
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
When I'm sitting in a submersible though,

333
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --

334
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --

335
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.

336
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So, I've wanted for a long time

337
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to figure out a different way to explore.

338
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.

339
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.

340
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And scientists have done this on land for years;

341
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we just use a color that the animals can't see

342
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and then a camera that can see that color.

343
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
You can't use infrared in the sea.

344
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem

345
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because it gets absorbed so quickly.

346
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Made an intensified camera,

347
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.

348
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Thing is, in science,

349
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover

350
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
before they'll give you the money.

351
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I didn't know what I was going to discover,

352
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
so I couldn't get the funding for this.

353
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic

354
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,

355
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.

356
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute

357
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
gave me time with their ROV

358
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
so that I could test it and we could figure out,

359
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use

360
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --

361
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
get the electronic jellyfish working.

362
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,

363
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy

364
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,

365
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the word Ziploc is still visible.

366
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,

367
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.

368
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But there came a moment when it all came together,

369
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and everything worked.

370
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film

371
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
by photographer Mark Richards,

372
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
who happened to be there at the precise moment

373
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that we discovered that it all came together.

374
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
That's me on the left,

375
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,

376
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.

377
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor

378
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)

379
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And we were very, very happy.

380
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So now we had a system

381
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that we could actually take to some place

382
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean

383
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that might be patrolled by large predators.

384
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And so, the place that we took it to

385
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
was this place called a Brine Pool,

386
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.

387
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It's a magical place.

388
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you --

389
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
we had a crummy camera at the time --

390
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but I was ecstatic.

391
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool,

392
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.

393
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It's clearly undisturbed by us.

394
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And I had my window into the deep sea.

395
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there

396
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.

397
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Four hours into the deployment,

398
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
we had programmed the electronic jellyfish

399
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to come on for the first time.

400
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Eighty-six seconds after

401
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
it went into its pinwheel display,

402
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we recorded this:

403
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
This is a squid, over six feet long,

404
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that is so new to science,

405
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.

406
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept.

407
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation

408
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and said, "This is what we will discover."

409
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And they gave me enough money to do it right,

410
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam --

411
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
which has been installed in

412
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the Monterey Canyon for the past year --

413
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and now, more recently,

414
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
a modular form of this system,

415
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
a much more mobile form

416
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that's a lot easier to launch and recover,

417
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots"

418
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to help explore

419
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and protect these areas,

420
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and, for me, learn more about

421
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the bioluminescence in these "hope spots."

422
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So one of these take-home messages here

423
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.

424
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And Sylvia has said

425
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,

426
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and she's right.

427
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity

428
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
to take a dive in a submersible,

429
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
say yes -- a thousand times, yes --

430
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and please turn out the lights.

431
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I promise, you'll love it.

432
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you.

433
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

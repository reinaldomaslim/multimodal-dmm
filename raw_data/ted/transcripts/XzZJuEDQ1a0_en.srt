1
0:00:13.131,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My first love was for the night sky.

2
0:00:16.432,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Love is complicated.

3
0:00:17.998,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You're looking at a fly-through of the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,

4
0:00:22.527,000 --> 0:00:26,000
one of the most distant images of our universe ever observed.

5
0:00:26.639,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Everything you see here is a galaxy,

6
0:00:29.153,000 --> 0:00:32,000
comprised of billions of stars each.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And the farthest galaxy is a trillion, trillion kilometers away.

8
0:00:37.881,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As an astrophysicist, I have the awesome privilege of studying

9
0:00:40.805,000 --> 0:00:43,000
some of the most exotic objects in our universe.

10
0:00:44.252,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my career

11
0:00:48.064,000 --> 0:00:52,000
are supermassive, hyperactive black holes.

12
0:00:53.813,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Weighing one to 10 billion times the mass of our own sun,

13
0:00:57.931,000 --> 0:00:59,000
these galactic black holes are devouring material,

14
0:01:00.825,000 --> 0:01:03,000
at a rate of upwards of 1,000 times more

15
0:01:04.145,000 --> 0:01:07,000
than your "average" supermassive black hole.

16
0:01:07.512,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:1,000
These two characteristics,

18
0:01:11.334,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with a few others, make them quasars.

19
0:01:14.548,000 --> 0:01:16,000
At the same time, the objects I study

20
0:01:17.465,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are producing some of the most powerful particle streams

21
0:01:20.242,000 --> 0:01:21,000
ever observed.

22
0:01:21.937,000 --> 0:01:23,000
These narrow streams, called jets,

23
0:01:24.777,000 --> 0:01:28,000
are moving at 99.99 percent of the speed of light,

24
0:01:29.385,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and are pointed directly at the Earth.

25
0:01:33.368,000 --> 0:01:38,000
These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive and supermassive black holes

26
0:01:39.257,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are called blazars, or blazing quasars.

27
0:01:43.801,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's

28
0:01:47.282,000 --> 0:01:49,000
most efficient particle accelerators,

29
0:01:49.802,000 --> 0:01:53,000
transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy.

30
0:01:54.72,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Here, I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar.

31
0:01:57.469,000 --> 0:02:,000
The dinner plate by which material falls onto the black hole

32
0:02:00.669,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is called the accretion disc,

33
0:02:02.256,000 --> 0:02:03,000
shown here in blue.

34
0:02:04.082,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole

35
0:02:07.061,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and accelerated to insanely high speeds

36
0:02:09.085,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in the jet, shown here in white.

37
0:02:11.912,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Although the blazar system is rare,

38
0:02:14.599,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk,

39
0:02:17.606,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and then flings some of it out via a jet, is more common.

40
0:02:21.647,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system

41
0:02:24.091,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context.

42
0:02:33.89,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out,

43
0:02:38.295,000 --> 0:02:41,000
one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now

44
0:02:41.342,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is where the highest-energy jet emission comes from.

45
0:02:45.053,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In this image, I'm interested in where this white blob forms

46
0:02:48.974,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and if, as a result, there's any relationship between the jet

47
0:02:52.617,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the accretion disc material.

48
0:02:55.483,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Clear answers to this question

49
0:02:57.286,000 --> 0:03:,000
were almost completely inaccessible until 2008,

50
0:03:00.401,000 --> 0:03:04,000
when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light --

51
0:03:04.675,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that is, light with energies a million times higher

52
0:03:07.387,000 --> 0:03:1,000
than your standard x-ray scan.

53
0:03:10.934,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data

54
0:03:14.824,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and the visible light data from day to day and year to year,

55
0:03:18.493,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to better localize these gamma ray blobs.

56
0:03:21.767,000 --> 0:03:23,000
My research shows that in some instances,

57
0:03:24.453,000 --> 0:03:27,000
these blobs form much closer to the black hole

58
0:03:27.513,000 --> 0:03:29,000
than we initially thought.

59
0:03:29.873,000 --> 0:03:3,000
As we more confidently localize

60
0:03:31.764,000 --> 0:03:33,000
where these gamma ray blobs are forming,

61
0:03:34.06,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we can better understand how jets are being accelerated,

62
0:03:37.583,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and ultimately reveal the dynamic processes

63
0:03:40.191,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed.

64
0:03:45.892,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This all started as a love story.

65
0:03:49.501,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it still is.

66
0:03:51.414,000 --> 0:03:55,000
This love transformed me from a curious, stargazing young girl

67
0:03:55.624,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to a professional astrophysicist,

68
0:03:57.445,000 --> 0:04:,000
hot on the heels of celestial discovery.

69
0:04:00.782,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Who knew that chasing after the universe

70
0:04:03.202,000 --> 0:04:06,000
would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth.

71
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Then again, when do we ever know where love's first flutter

72
0:04:10.468,000 --> 0:04:11,000
will truly take us.

73
0:04:11.942,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Thank you.

74
0:04:13.171,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I love the Internet.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's true.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Think about everything it has brought us.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Think about all the services we use,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
all the connectivity,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
all the entertainment,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
all the business, all the commerce.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it's happening during our lifetimes.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm pretty sure that one day

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we'll be writing history books

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
hundreds of years from now. This time

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
our generation will be remembered

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as the generation that got online,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the generation

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that built something really and truly global.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But yes, it's also true

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that the Internet has problems, very serious problems,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
problems with security

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and problems with privacy.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I've spent my career

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
fighting these problems.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So let me show you something.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This here

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is Brain.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is a floppy disk

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
infected by Brain.A.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's the first virus we ever found

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
for PC computers.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And we actually know

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
where Brain came from.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We know because it says so

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
inside the code.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Let's take a look.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
All right.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and if we take a closer look inside,

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we'll see that right there,

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And then it continues,

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And Basit and Amjad are first names,

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Pakistani first names.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, 1986.

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now it's 2011.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's 25 years ago.

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So half a year ago,

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I decided to go to Pakistan myself.

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.

53
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is from the city of Lahore,

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which is around 300 kilometers south

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Here's a typical street view.

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And here's the street or road leading to this building,

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I knocked on the door.

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
You want to guess who opened the door?

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So here standing up is Basit.

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.

68
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.

69
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I asked them why.

70
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I asked them how they feel about what they started.

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I got some sort of satisfaction

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
from learning that both Basit and Amjad

73
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
had had their computers infected dozens of times

74
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
by completely unrelated other viruses

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
over these years.

76
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So there is some sort of justice

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in the world after all.

78
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, the viruses that we used to see

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the 1980s and 1990s

80
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
obviously are not a problem any more.

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So let me just show you a couple of examples

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of what they used to look like.

83
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What I'm running here

84
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is a system that enables me

85
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to run age-old programs on a modern computer.

86
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.

87
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What we have here is a list of old viruses.

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
For example,

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
let's go with the Centipede virus first.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And you can see at the top of the screen,

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
there's a centipede scrolling across your computer

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when you get infected by this one.

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You know that you're infected

95
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because it actually shows up.

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,

97
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
invented in Russia in 1992.

98
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Siren noise)

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And the last example,

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
guess what the Walker virus does?

102
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen

103
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
once you get infected.

104
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So it used to be fairly easy to know

105
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that you're infected by a virus,

106
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when the viruses were written by hobbyists

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and teenagers.

108
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Today, they are no longer being written

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
by hobbyists and teenagers.

110
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Today, viruses are a global problem.

111
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What we have here in the background

112
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
where we track virus infections worldwide.

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So we can actually see in real time

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and Russia and elsewhere.

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems

118
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
through the Web,

119
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we can see in real time

120
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
just some kind of idea of how many viruses,

121
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
how many new examples of malware we find every single day.

122
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Here's the latest virus we've found,

123
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in a file called Server.exe.

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And we found it right over here three seconds ago --

125
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the previous one, six seconds ago.

126
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And if we just scroll around,

127
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
it's just massive.

128
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.

129
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware

130
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
every single day.

131
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So where are all these coming from then?

132
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs

133
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
writing these viruses

134
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because they make money with their viruses.

135
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's gangs like --

136
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
let's go to GangstaBucks.com.

137
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This is a website operating in Moscow

138
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
where these guys are buying infected computers.

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So if you are a virus writer

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and you're capable of infecting Windows computers,

141
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but you don't know what to do with them,

142
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you can sell those infected computers --

143
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
somebody else's computers -- to these guys.

144
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.

145
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So how do these guys then monetize

146
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
those infected computers?

147
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Well there's multiple different ways,

148
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts

149
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
when you do online banking,

150
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
or keyloggers.

151
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,

152
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and they record everything you type.

153
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.

154
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Every single Google search you type

155
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is saved and sent to the criminals.

156
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.

157
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Same thing with every single password and so on.

158
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the thing that they're actually looking for most

159
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are sessions where you go online

160
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and do online purchases in any online store.

161
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Because when you do purchases in online stores,

162
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,

163
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
your credit card number and the credit card security codes.

164
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And here's an example of a file

165
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.

166
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's the credit card number,

167
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that's the expiration date, that's the security code,

168
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and that's the name of the owner of the card.

169
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information,

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you can just go online and buy whatever you want

171
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
with this information.

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that, obviously, is a problem.

173
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We now have a whole underground marketplace

174
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and business ecosystem

175
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
built around online crime.

176
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
One example of how these guys

177
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
actually are capable of monetizing their operations:

178
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL

179
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and search for wanted persons.

180
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,

181
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and his partner in crime,

182
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,

183
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,

184
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
a U.S. citizen.

185
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,

186
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.

187
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They are both right now on the run.

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Nobody knows where they are.

189
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,

190
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
froze a Swiss bank account

191
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
belonging to Mr. Jain,

192
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.

193
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So the amount of money online crime generates

194
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is significant.

195
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And that means that the online criminals

196
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
can actually afford to invest into their attacks.

197
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We know that online criminals

198
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
are hiring programmers, hiring testing people,

199
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
testing their code,

200
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
having back-end systems with SQL databases.

201
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And they can afford to watch how we work --

202
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
like how security people work --

203
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and try to work their way around

204
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
any security precautions we can build.

205
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They also use the global nature of Internet

206
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to their advantage.

207
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I mean, the Internet is international.

208
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
That's why we call it the Internet.

209
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And if you just go and take a look

210
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
at what's happening in the online world,

211
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
here's a video built by Clarified Networks,

212
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.

213
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,

214
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
moves around from one country to another

215
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as soon as the website is tried to shut down.

216
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So you just can't shut these guys down.

217
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They will switch from one country to another,

218
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
from one jurisdiction to another --

219
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
moving around the world,

220
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
using the fact that we don't have the capability

221
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to globally police operations like this.

222
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So the Internet is as if

223
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
someone would have given free plane tickets

224
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to all the online criminals of the world.

225
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before

226
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
can reach us.

227
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?

228
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
How do you actually track them down?

229
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Let me give you an example.

230
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
What we have here is one exploit file.

231
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,

232
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which contains an exploit.

233
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,

234
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
it actually takes over your computer and runs code.

235
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file --

236
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
well there's the image header,

237
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and there the actual code of the attack starts.

238
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And that code has been encrypted,

239
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so let's decrypt it.

240
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.

241
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You just have to believe me,

242
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it is, it is.

243
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And we can go here

244
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and actually start decrypting it.

245
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.

246
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.

247
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But just keep staring at it.

248
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You'll actually see that down here

249
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you can see a Web address:

250
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe

251
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And when you view this image on your computer

252
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it actually is going to download and run that program.

253
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.

254
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But even more interestingly,

255
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
if we continue decrypting,

256
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we'll find this mysterious string,

257
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
which says O600KO78RUS.

258
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That code is there underneath the encryption

259
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as some sort of a signature.

260
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It's not used for anything.

261
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.

262
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So obviously I Googled for it.

263
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I got zero hits; wasn't there.

264
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.

265
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,

266
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and one of them mentioned,

267
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
well, it ends in RUS like Russia.

268
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And 78 is the city code

269
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
for the city of St. Petersburg.

270
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers

271
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and car license plates and stuff like that.

272
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,

273
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and through a long road,

274
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we eventually found this one particular website.

275
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years

276
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
who runs his own website,

277
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.

278
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And on this blog, he blogs about his life,

279
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
about his life in St. Petersburg --

280
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
he's in his early 20s --

281
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
about his cat,

282
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
about his girlfriend.

283
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And he drives a very nice car.

284
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In fact, this guy drives

285
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a Mercedes-Benz S600

286
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
V12

287
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with a six-liter engine

288
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with more than 400 horsepower.

289
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.

290
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
How do I know about this car?

291
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Because he blogged about the car.

292
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He actually had a car accident.

293
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In downtown St. Petersburg,

294
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
he actually crashed his car into another car.

295
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And he put blogged images about the car accident --

296
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that's his Mercedes --

297
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.

298
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara

299
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
ends in 78RUS.

300
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,

301
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
you can see that the plate of the Mercedes

302
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
is O600KO78RUS.

303
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Now I'm not a lawyer,

304
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but if I would be,

305
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
this is where I would say, "I rest my case."

306
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

307
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So what happens when online criminals are caught?

308
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well in most cases it never gets this far.

309
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The vast majority of the online crime cases,

310
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.

311
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And even if we are able to find online criminals,

312
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
quite often there is no outcome.

313
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,

314
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or for some reason we can't take them down.

315
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I wish it would be easier;

316
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
unfortunately it isn't.

317
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But things are also changing

318
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
at a very rapid pace.

319
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.

320
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So if you look at what Stuxnet did

321
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is that it infected these.

322
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,

323
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
programmable logic [controller].

324
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And this is what runs our infrastructure.

325
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This is what runs everything around us.

326
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display,

327
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
no keyboard,

328
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.

329
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
For example, the elevators in this building

330
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
most likely are controlled by one of these.

331
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And when Stuxnet infects one of these,

332
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that's a massive revolution

333
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.

334
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Because everything around us is being run by these.

335
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.

336
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You go to any factory, any power plant,

337
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
any chemical plant, any food processing plant,

338
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
you look around --

339
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
everything is being run by computers.

340
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Everything is being run by computers.

341
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Everything is reliant on these computers working.

342
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We have become very reliant

343
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
on Internet,

344
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
on basic things like electricity, obviously,

345
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
on computers working.

346
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And this really is something

347
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which creates completely new problems for us.

348
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
We must have some way

349
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
of continuing to work

350
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
even if computers fail.

351
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Laughter)

352
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
(Applause)

353
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So preparedness means that we can do stuff

354
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
even when the things we take for granted

355
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
aren't there.

356
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's actually very basic stuff --

357
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
thinking about continuity, thinking about backups,

358
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
thinking about the things that actually matter.

359
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Now I told you --

360
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
(Laughter)

361
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I love the Internet. I do.

362
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Think about all the services we have online.

363
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Think about if they are taken away from you,

364
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
if one day you don't actually have them

365
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
for some reason or another.

366
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I see beauty in the future of the Internet,

367
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but I'm worried

368
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that we might not see that.

369
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I'm worried that we are running into problems

370
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
because of online crime.

371
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Online crime is the one thing

372
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that might take these things away from us.

373
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Laughter)

374
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I've spent my life

375
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
defending the Net,

376
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,

377
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
we are running a risk of losing it all.

378
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We have to do this globally,

379
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and we have to do it right now.

380
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
What we need

381
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
is more global, international law enforcement work

382
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
to find online criminal gangs --

383
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
these organized gangs

384
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that are making millions out of their attacks.

385
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
That's much more important

386
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.

387
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
What actually matters

388
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
is actually finding the people behind these attacks,

389
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and even more importantly,

390
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
we have to find the people

391
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
who are about to become

392
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
part of this online world of crime,

393
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but haven't yet done it.

394
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We have to find the people with the skills,

395
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but without the opportunities

396
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and give them the opportunities

397
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to use their skills for good.

398
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Thank you very much.

399
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

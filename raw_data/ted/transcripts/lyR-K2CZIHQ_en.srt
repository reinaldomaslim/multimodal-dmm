0:00:13.912,000 --> 0:00:15,000
On November 5th, 1990,

3
0:00:16.333,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked

4
0:00:19.132,000 --> 0:00:21,000
into a hotel in Manhattan

5
0:00:21.517,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,

6
0:00:24.482,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the leader of the Jewish Defense League.

7
0:00:28.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,

8
0:00:30.94,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but while serving time on lesser charges,

9
0:00:34.566,000 --> 0:00:36,000
he and other men began planning attacks

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on a dozen New York City landmarks,

11
0:00:39.051,000 --> 0:00:41,000
including tunnels, synagogues

12
0:00:41.395,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the United Nations headquarters.

13
0:00:44.281,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Thankfully, those plans were foiled

14
0:00:46.004,000 --> 0:00:48,000
by an FBI informant.

15
0:00:48.841,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Sadly, the 1993 bombing

16
0:00:51.397,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of the World Trade Center was not.

17
0:00:54.578,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Nosair would eventually be convicted

18
0:00:56.317,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for his involvement in the plot.

19
0:00:59.741,000 --> 0:01:03,000
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.

20
0:01:03.988,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

21
0:01:05.898,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,

22
0:01:09.622,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and a loving American mother and grade school teacher,

23
0:01:12.817,000 --> 0:01:13,000
who together tried their best

24
0:01:14.068,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to create a happy childhood for me.

25
0:01:17.181,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It wasn't until I was seven years old

26
0:01:18.723,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that our family dynamic started to change.

27
0:01:22.266,000 --> 0:01:25,000
My father exposed me to a side of Islam

28
0:01:25.416,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that few people, including the majority of Muslims,

29
0:01:28.343,000 --> 0:01:3,000
get to see.

30
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's been my experience that when people

31
0:01:32.729,000 --> 0:01:34,000
take the time to interact with one another,

32
0:01:35.091,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,

33
0:01:38.149,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we all want the same things out of life.

34
0:01:40.601,000 --> 0:01:43,000
However, in every religion, in every population,

35
0:01:43.778,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you'll find a small percentage of people

36
0:01:46.366,000 --> 0:01:48,000
who hold so fervently to their beliefs

37
0:01:49.324,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that they feel they must use any means necessary

38
0:01:52.088,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to make others live as they do.

39
0:01:55.684,000 --> 0:01:56,000
A few months prior to his arrest,

40
0:01:57.545,000 --> 0:01:59,000
he sat me down and explained that

41
0:01:59.547,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for the past few weekends, he and some friends

42
0:02:02.666,000 --> 0:02:04,000
had been going to a shooting range on Long Island

43
0:02:04.78,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for target practice.

44
0:02:06.963,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.

45
0:02:10.653,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,

46
0:02:12.464,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which unbeknownst to our group was being watched

47
0:02:14.979,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by the FBI.

48
0:02:18.1,000 --> 0:02:18,000
When it was my turn to shoot,

49
0:02:19.081,000 --> 0:02:21,000
my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder

50
0:02:21.767,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and explained how to aim at the target

51
0:02:23.212,000 --> 0:02:26,000
about 30 yards off.

52
0:02:26.353,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That day, the last bullet I shot

53
0:02:28.696,000 --> 0:02:31,000
hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target

54
0:02:31.715,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,

55
0:02:34.844,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the entire target burst into flames.

56
0:02:38.818,000 --> 0:02:39,000
My uncle turned to the other men,

57
0:02:40.719,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."

58
0:02:44.04,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Like father, like son.

59
0:02:47.795,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment,

60
0:02:50.402,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but it wasn't until a few years later

61
0:02:52.182,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.

62
0:02:55.957,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They thought they saw in me the same destruction

63
0:02:58.257,000 --> 0:03:01,000
my father was capable of.

64
0:03:01.588,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Those men would eventually be convicted

65
0:03:03.967,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives

66
0:03:07.94,000 --> 0:03:11,000
into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower,

67
0:03:12.089,000 --> 0:03:14,000
causing an explosion that killed six people

68
0:03:14.93,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and injured over 1,000 others.

69
0:03:18.31,000 --> 0:03:2,000
These were the men I looked up to.

70
0:03:20.701,000 --> 0:03:24,000
These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.

71
0:03:24.897,000 --> 0:03:25,000
By the time I turned 19,

72
0:03:26.668,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I had already moved 20 times in my life,

73
0:03:29.937,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and that instability during my childhood

74
0:03:31.966,000 --> 0:03:32,000
didn't really provide an opportunity

75
0:03:33.44,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to make many friends.

76
0:03:35.321,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone,

77
0:03:38.474,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it was time to pack up and move to the next town.

78
0:03:41.643,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Being the perpetual new face in class,

79
0:03:43.822,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I was frequently the target of bullies.

80
0:03:46.461,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I kept my identity a secret from my classmates

81
0:03:48.771,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to avoid being targeted,

82
0:03:50.089,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class

83
0:03:53.485,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was more than enough ammunition.

84
0:03:56.002,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So for the most part, I spent my time at home

85
0:03:58.199,000 --> 0:03:59,000
reading books and watching TV

86
0:03:59.87,000 --> 0:04:,000
or playing video games.

87
0:04:01.639,000 --> 0:04:03,000
For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,

88
0:04:04.509,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to say the least,

89
0:04:06.759,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and growing up in a bigoted household,

90
0:04:08.194,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I wasn't prepared for the real world.

91
0:04:10.674,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I'd been raised to judge people

92
0:04:12.393,000 --> 0:04:14,000
based on arbitrary measurements,

93
0:04:14.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
like a person's race or religion.

94
0:04:18.203,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So what opened my eyes?

95
0:04:21.354,000 --> 0:04:22,000
One of my first experiences

96
0:04:22.948,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that challenged this way of thinking

97
0:04:25.13,000 --> 0:04:27,000
was during the 2000 presidential elections.

98
0:04:28.117,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Through a college prep program,

99
0:04:30.151,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I was able to take part

100
0:04:31.285,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.

101
0:04:34.655,000 --> 0:04:36,000
My particular group's focus was on youth violence,

102
0:04:37.586,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,

103
0:04:39.937,000 --> 0:04:43,000
this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.

104
0:04:44.009,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.

105
0:04:48.322,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One day toward the end of the convention,

106
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I found out that one of the kids I had befriended

107
0:04:53.418,000 --> 0:04:55,000
was Jewish.

108
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, it had taken several days

109
0:04:56.961,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for this detail to come to light,

110
0:04:58.604,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I realized that there was no natural animosity

111
0:05:02.364,000 --> 0:05:04,000
between the two of us.

112
0:05:04.609,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I had never had a Jewish friend before,

113
0:05:07.665,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and frankly I felt a sense of pride

114
0:05:10.474,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in having been able to overcome a barrier

115
0:05:12.459,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that for most of my life I had been led to believe

116
0:05:14.743,000 --> 0:05:16,000
was insurmountable.

117
0:05:17.184,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Another major turning point came when

118
0:05:19.2,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,

119
0:05:21.722,000 --> 0:05:23,000
an amusement park.

120
0:05:24.114,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,

121
0:05:27.01,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and that experience proved to be fundamental

122
0:05:29.367,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to the development of my character.

123
0:05:33.248,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Most of my life, I'd been taught

124
0:05:34.508,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,

125
0:05:38.254,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that all gay people were a negative influence.

126
0:05:41.719,000 --> 0:05:43,000
As chance would have it, I had the opportunity

127
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to work with some of the gay performers

128
0:05:45.746,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at a show there,

129
0:05:47.126,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and soon found that many were the kindest,

130
0:05:49.66,000 --> 0:05:52,000
least judgmental people I had ever met.

131
0:05:53.549,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Being bullied as a kid

132
0:05:55.792,000 --> 0:05:57,000
created a sense of empathy in me

133
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:05:59,000
toward the suffering of others,

134
0:05:59.626,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it comes very unnaturally to me

135
0:06:01.574,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to treat people who are kind

136
0:06:03.542,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in any other way than how I would want to be treated.

137
0:06:07.57,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Because of that feeling, I was able

138
0:06:09.505,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child

139
0:06:13.892,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with real life experience and interaction.

140
0:06:17.255,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I don't know what it's like to be gay,

141
0:06:19.597,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but I'm well acquainted with being judged

142
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
for something that's beyond my control.

143
0:06:25.236,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Then there was "The Daily Show."

144
0:06:28.971,000 --> 0:06:3,000
On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me

145
0:06:31.243,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry

146
0:06:34.922,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and helped me to realize that a person's race,

147
0:06:37.239,000 --> 0:06:4,000
religion or sexual orientation

148
0:06:40.335,000 --> 0:06:44,000
had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.

149
0:06:44.978,000 --> 0:06:47,000
He was in many ways a father figure to me

150
0:06:48.353,000 --> 0:06:51,000
when I was in desperate need of one.

151
0:06:51.694,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place,

152
0:06:55.598,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more

153
0:06:57.983,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to positively influence my worldview

154
0:07:00.323,000 --> 0:07:01,000
than my own extremist father

155
0:07:02.17,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is not lost on me.

156
0:07:05.553,000 --> 0:07:07,000
One day, I had a conversation with my mother

157
0:07:07.713,000 --> 0:07:09,000
about how my worldview was starting to change,

158
0:07:09.883,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and she said something to me

159
0:07:12.559,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that I will hold dear to my heart

160
0:07:14.09,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for as long as I live.

161
0:07:17.339,000 --> 0:07:18,000
She looked at me with the weary eyes

162
0:07:18.81,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of someone who had experienced

163
0:07:20.532,000 --> 0:07:24,000
enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,

164
0:07:24.59,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"I'm tired of hating people."

165
0:07:28.263,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In that instant, I realized how much negative energy

166
0:07:31.14,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.

167
0:07:35.979,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.

168
0:07:38.88,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I changed it when my family decided

169
0:07:40.915,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to end our connection with my father

170
0:07:42.58,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and start a new life.

171
0:07:44.942,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So why would I out myself

172
0:07:47.1,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and potentially put myself in danger?

173
0:07:50.5,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Well, that's simple.

174
0:07:52.368,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday

175
0:07:56.13,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who is compelled to use violence

176
0:07:58.343,000 --> 0:08:,000
may hear my story and realize

177
0:08:00.704,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that there is a better way,

178
0:08:03.201,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that although I had been subjected

179
0:08:04.675,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to this violent, intolerant ideology,

180
0:08:07.431,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that I did not become fanaticized.

181
0:08:09.92,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Instead, I choose to use my experience

182
0:08:12.557,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to fight back against terrorism,

183
0:08:14.93,000 --> 0:08:18,000
against the bigotry.

184
0:08:19.321,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I do it for the victims of terrorism

185
0:08:22.109,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and their loved ones,

186
0:08:24.291,000 --> 0:08:25,000
for the terrible pain and loss

187
0:08:26.124,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that terrorism has forced upon their lives.

188
0:08:29.325,000 --> 0:08:31,000
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out

189
0:08:31.693,000 --> 0:08:33,000
against these senseless acts

190
0:08:34.225,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and condemn my father's actions.

191
0:08:38.219,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof

192
0:08:40.862,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,

193
0:08:45.52,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and the son does not have to follow

194
0:08:48.433,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the ways of his father.

195
0:08:51.515,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I am not my father.

196
0:08:54.305,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Thank you. (Applause)

197
0:08:57.205,000 --> 0:09:,000
Thank you, everybody. (Applause)

198
0:09:00.864,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Thank you all. (Applause)

199
0:09:03.504,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Thanks a lot. (Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is

3
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that bridge to the future, to the point where we

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:54,000
put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how

9
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that, you really have to look first at agriculture.

11
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And

12
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you've got to deal with all types of awful things,

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure

16
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.

18
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:28,000
makes a difference.

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant

21
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the

22
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
rivers flood. You start getting this organic

23
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this

24
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,

25
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
leads to very large-scale agriculture.

26
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You put together machines and water, and you get

27
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
landscapes that look like this. And then you get

28
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:58,000
sales that look like this. It's brute force. So

29
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
what you've been doing in agriculture is you start

30
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
out with something that's a reasonably natural

31
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
system. You start taming that natural system. You

32
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
put a lot of force behind that natural system. You

33
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --

34
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you

35
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
end up with systems that look like this.

36
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
been approaching energy. So the lesson in

38
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
agriculture is that you can actually change the

39
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
system that's based on brute force as you start

40
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
merging that system and learning that system and

41
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
actually applying biology. And you move from a

42
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
discipline of engineering, you move from a

43
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of

44
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
biology. And probably one of the most important

45
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.

46
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the

47
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of

48
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he

49
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
deserves this stuff because he probably has fed

50
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
more people than any other human being alive

51
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because he researched how to put biology behind

52
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:12,000
seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and China no longer have these massive famines is

54
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow

55
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
grains in a more efficient way and launched the

56
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of

57
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:24,000
people have criticized. But of course, those are

58
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
people who don't realize that China and India,

59
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
instead of having huge amounts of starving people,

60
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
are exporting grains.

61
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the irony of this particular system is the

62
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
place where he did the research, which was Mexico,

63
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
didn't adopt this technology, ignored this

64
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
technology, talked about why this technology

65
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
should be thought about, but not really applied.

66
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain

67
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
importers on the planet because it doesn't apply

68
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in

69
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point

70
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
where there aren't statues of this man all over

71
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Mexico. There are in China and India. And the

72
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Institute that this guy ran has now moved to

73
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
India. That is the difference between adopting

74
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
technologies and discussing technologies.

75
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount

76
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of people in the world. It's that this is the net

77
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
effect in terms of what technology does, if you

78
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
understand biology.

79
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:24,000
What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take

80
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
agriculture over a century, agriculture in about

81
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
1900 would have been recognizable to somebody

82
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look

83
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
different. The machines were tractors or stuff

84
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
instead of mules, but the farmer would have

85
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is

86
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What

87
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
really started to change in agriculture is when

88
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you started moving from this brute force

89
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's

90
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
where you get your productivity increases. And as

91
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you do that stuff, here's what happens to

92
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:58,000
productivity.

93
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100

94
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:06,000
bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor

95
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,

96
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
whereas the rest of the economy increased about

97
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase

98
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in how much is produced per person.

99
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just

100
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.

101
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize

102
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
agriculture from mountains of stuff that people

103
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:32,000
have overproduced.

104
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This would be a good outcome for energy. And of

105
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
course, by now, you're probably saying to

106
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:44,000
yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about

107
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
energy and here's this guy talking about biology."

108
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So where's the link between these two things?

109
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're

110
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
discussing what to do about a system that we don't

111
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
understand. We don't even know what oil is. We

112
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
don't know where oil comes from. I mean,

113
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
literally, it's still a source of debate what

114
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
this black river of stuff is and where it comes

115
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
from. The best assumption, and one of the best

116
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes

117
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:18,000
out of this stuff, that these things absorb

118
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of

119
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
years, and you get these black rivers.

120
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if

121
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,

122
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be

123
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
concentrated sunlight. And if you think of

124
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is

125
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,

126
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why

127
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you get these rainbows.

128
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And as you're looking at this system, if

129
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then

130
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got

131
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as

132
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
part of these solar panels.

133
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly

134
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
over west Texas, the types of wells that you're

135
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures

136
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of Kansas and those irrigated plots.

137
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This is how you farm oil. And as you think of

138
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:29,000
farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started

139
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with this brute force approach. And then what did

140
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And

141
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even

142
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
bigger. And we are getting really destructive as

143
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we're going out and farming this bioenergy.

144
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an

145
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest

146
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
trucks in the world are working here, and then

147
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is

148
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the

149
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to

150
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
separate it, which only works at today's oil

151
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:06,000
prices.

152
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same

153
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,000
stuff. It is probably plants, except that these

154
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
have been burned and crushed under pressure.

155
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So you take something like this, you burn it, you

156
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get

157
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.

158
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But

159
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat

160
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.

161
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous

162
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
places because in some of these coalmines, you

163
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:5,000
get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So

164
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you're producing a biogas out of coal in some

165
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
mines, but not in others.

166
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Any place you see a differential, there're some

167
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
interesting questions. There's some questions as

168
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to what you should be doing with this stuff. But

169
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same

170
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying

171
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
exactly the same technology.

172
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get

173
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:14,000
through your brute force approach, then you just

174
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with

175
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the single largest source of carbon emissions,

176
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably

177
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
not the best use of bioenergy.

178
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
As you think of what are the alternatives to this

179
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
system -- it's important to find alternatives

180
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in

181
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in

182
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge

183
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
coal reserves that are sitting out there, and

184
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we've got to start thinking of them as biological

185
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
energy, because if we keep treating them as

186
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're

187
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
going to be in deep doo-doo.

188
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological

189
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:09,000
product. And as you think of gas, well, you're

190
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:14,000
familiar with gas. And here's a different way of

191
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:15,000
mining coal.

192
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this

193
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to

194
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may

195
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:31,000
get a differential in gas output between one mine

196
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up

197
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and another one may not blow up -- may be because

198
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.

199
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You

200
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:52,000
eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It

201
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
may turn out that biological processes in coalmines

202
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
have the same process. If that is true, then

203
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal

204
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it

205
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff

206
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
process that coal in a biological fashion as you

207
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:12,000
did in agriculture.

208
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It

209
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not

210
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
importing corn into Iowa because you've built so

211
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to

212
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
understand the transition that occurred in

213
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
agriculture, from brute force into biological

214
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
force. And in the measure that you can do that,

215
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it

216
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:36,000
pretty quickly.

217
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We already have some indicators of productivity on

218
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields

219
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
or petroleum fields that have been running for

220
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
decades, you can get a really substantial

221
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your

222
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
output. This is just the beginning stages of this

223
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
stuff.

224
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who

225
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
did part of the sequencing of the human genome,

226
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
who just doubled the databases of genes and

227
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
proteins known on earth by sailing around the

228
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
world -- has been thinking about how you structure

229
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:11,000
this. And there's a series of smart people

230
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
thinking about this. And they've been putting

231
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,

232
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are

233
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
trying to do is to think of, how do you apply

234
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
biological principles to avoid brute force?

235
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as

236
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.

237
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the

238
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
genes as a software. And in the measure that you

239
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
begin to think of life as code that is

240
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
interchangeable, that can become energy, that can

241
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
become food, that can become fiber, that can

242
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
become human beings, that can become a whole

243
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
series of things, then you've got to shift your

244
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
approach as to how you're going to structure and

245
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
deal and think about energy in a very different

246
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:,000
way.

247
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
What are the first principles of this stuff and

248
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where are we heading? This is one of the gentle

249
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human

250
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton

251
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to

252
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.

253
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such

254
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
a modest guy that the day he won, his mother

255
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
called him and said, "I didn't realize there was

256
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just

257
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:37,000
won the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,

258
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find

259
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
him at the bench every single day, working on a

260
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
pipette and building stuff. And one of the things

261
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
this guy just built are these things.

262
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What is this? This is the first transplant of

263
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating

264
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
system out of one cell, insert it into a different

265
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate

266
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:07,000
species. That's one month old. You will see stuff

267
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in the next month that will be just as important

268
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:1,000
as this stuff.

269
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And as you think about this stuff and what the

270
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
implications of this are, we're going to start not

271
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
just converting ethanol from corn with very high

272
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
subsidies. We're going to start thinking about

273
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:28,000
biology entering energy. It is very expensive to

274
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:32,000
process this stuff, both in economic terms and in

275
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
energy terms.

276
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of

277
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you

278
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an

279
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
enormous amount of energy inside that vapor --

280
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to

281
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
separate out the sulfur. The difference between

282
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14

283
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these

284
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the

285
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
scale on these things is pretty large.

286
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now, if you can take part of the energy content

287
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:09,000
out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you

288
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
really do start applying biological principles to

289
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:16,000
energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where

290
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
you can get to wind, to the point where you can

291
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
get to solar, to the point where you can get to

292
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next

293
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an

294
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.

295
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But in the meantime, for the next decade at least,

296
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that

297
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:46,000
oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're

298
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
dealing with. And before I make this talk too

299
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:55,000
long, here's what's happening in the current

300
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:56,000
energy system.

301
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
86 percent of the energy we consume are

302
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're

303
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
consuming are probably processed plants and

304
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a

305
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
role in here for conservation. There's a role in

306
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:12,000
here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to

307
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
get that other portion right.

308
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge

309
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to the future. And as we think of this bridge to

310
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the future, one of the things you should ponder

311
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today

312
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous

313
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
amount of money and leaving most of the energy

314
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
down there. Which, of course, requires more energy

315
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to go out and get energy. The ratios become

316
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:4,000
idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may

317
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:43,000
even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and

318
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the energy output. That is a stupid way of

319
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
managing this system.

320
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Last point, last graph. One of the things that

321
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:57,000
we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This

322
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
is what oil prices look like, OK?

323
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:02,000
This is a very bad system because what happens is

324
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up

325
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:08,000
with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for

326
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
wind, or for something else, and then guess what?

327
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
The oil price goes through the floor. That company

328
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
goes out of business, and then you can bring the

329
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:15,000
oil price back up.

330
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,

331
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:22,000
let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the

332
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:27,000
United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put

333
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it

334
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:33,000
basically says for the next 20 years, the price of

335
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40

336
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:4,000
bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax

337
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax

338
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
goes away.

339
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:47,000
What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it

340
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:5,000
do for companies? It tells people, if you can

341
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:53,000
produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or

342
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks

343
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:59,000
a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a

344
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
business. But let's not put people through this

345
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:04,000
cycle where it doesn't pay to research because

346
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:06,000
your company will go out of business as OPEC

347
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:09,000
drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from

348
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
happening. Thank you.

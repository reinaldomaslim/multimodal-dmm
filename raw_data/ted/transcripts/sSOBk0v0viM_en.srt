No matter how hard you might try,

3
0:00:13.906,000 --> 0:00:15,000
you can't just flip a switch when you step into the office

4
0:00:16.899,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and turn your emotions off.

5
0:00:18.306,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Feeling feelings is part of being human.

6
0:00:21.365,000 --> 0:00:23,000
[The Way We Work]

7
0:00:25.816,000 --> 0:00:28,000
A pervasive myth exists that emotions don't belong at work,

8
0:00:29.666,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and this often leads us

9
0:00:31.056,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to mistakenly equate professionalism with being stoic or even cold.

10
0:00:35.236,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But research shows that in the moments when our colleagues

11
0:00:37.999,000 --> 0:00:39,000
drop their glossy professional presentation,

12
0:00:40.146,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we're actually much more likely to believe what they're telling us.

13
0:00:43.327,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We feel connected to the people around us.

14
0:00:45.351,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We try harder, we perform better

15
0:00:47.503,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and we're just generally kinder.

16
0:00:49.554,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So it's about time that we learn how to embrace emotion at work.

17
0:00:53.266,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now, that's not to say

18
0:00:55.166,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you should suddenly become a feelings fire hose.

19
0:00:58.014,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A line exists between sharing, which builds trust,

20
0:01:01.323,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and oversharing, which destroys it.

21
0:01:03.746,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If you suddenly let your feelings run wild at work

22
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and give people far more information than they bargained for,

23
0:01:10.256,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you make everyone around you uncomfortable

24
0:01:12.386,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and you also undermine yourself.

25
0:01:13.956,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You're more likely to be seen as weak or lacking self awareness,

26
0:01:17.589,000 --> 0:01:2,000
so, great to say you weren't feeling well last night --

27
0:01:21.01,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you don't need to go into every lurid detail

28
0:01:23.166,000 --> 0:01:26,000
about how you got reacquainted with your half-digested dinner.

29
0:01:26.516,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So there's a wide spectrum of emotional expression.

30
0:01:29.456,000 --> 0:01:31,000
On one hand, you have under-emoters,

31
0:01:31.896,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or people who have a hard time talking about their feelings,

32
0:01:34.73,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and on the other end are over-emoters,

33
0:01:37.656,000 --> 0:01:41,000
those who constantly share everything that's going on inside,

34
0:01:42.009,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and neither of these make for a healthy workplace.

35
0:01:44.396,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So what's the balance between these two extremes?

36
0:01:47.006,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's something called selective vulnerability.

37
0:01:49.696,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Selective vulnerability is opening up

38
0:01:52.585,000 --> 0:01:55,000
while still prioritizing stability and psychological safety,

39
0:01:56.606,000 --> 0:01:58,000
both for you and for your colleagues.

40
0:01:58.936,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Luckily, anyone can learn

41
0:02:00.625,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to be selectively vulnerable, with practice.

42
0:02:03.107,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Here are four ways to get started.

43
0:02:04.906,000 --> 0:02:07,000
First, flag your feelings without becoming emotionally leaky.

44
0:02:08.856,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Bad moods are contagious,

45
0:02:10.386,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and even if you're not vocalizing what you're feeling,

46
0:02:12.934,000 --> 0:02:15,000
chances are your body language or your expressions

47
0:02:16.116,000 --> 0:02:17,000
are a dead giveaway.

48
0:02:17.416,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So if you are crossing your arms or hammering on your keyboard,

49
0:02:20.466,000 --> 0:02:22,000
your coworkers are going to know you're upset.

50
0:02:23.165,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And if you don't say anything,

51
0:02:24.696,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they might start to think it's about them and get worried.

52
0:02:27.566,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So if you are reacting to a non-work-related event,

53
0:02:30.606,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so traffic for example, just flag it.

54
0:02:33.146,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You don't need to go into detail.

55
0:02:34.926,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You can say something as simple as "I'm having a bad morning.

56
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It has nothing to do with you."

57
0:02:39.846,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now if it's a work-related event

58
0:02:41.436,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's causing you to feel strong emotions,

59
0:02:43.925,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that brings us to point number two.

60
0:02:45.636,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Try to understand the need behind your emotion,

61
0:02:48.509,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and then address that need.

62
0:02:49.856,000 --> 0:02:53,000
If you suddenly start to find everyone around you irritating,

63
0:02:54.397,000 --> 0:02:55,000
sit back and reflect on that.

64
0:02:55.956,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And it might be that you're irritable because you're anxious,

65
0:02:58.886,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and you're anxious because you're worried about hitting a looming deadline.

66
0:03:02.482,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And in that case, you can go back to your team

67
0:03:04.649,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to address that need and say something like,

68
0:03:06.726,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"I want to make sure I get everything done ahead of the deadline.

69
0:03:09.831,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Can you help me put together a realistic plan to do that?"

70
0:03:12.567,000 --> 0:03:13,000
If you're thinking of sharing,

71
0:03:14.164,000 --> 0:03:16,000
try and put yourself in the other person's shoes.

72
0:03:16.555,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So if what you're about to say would help you feel more supported

73
0:03:20.753,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and better understand the situation,

74
0:03:22.881,000 --> 0:03:23,000
then go ahead and share it.

75
0:03:24.46,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But if it gives you any kind of pause, you might want to leave it out.

76
0:03:28.086,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And finally, read the room and provide a path forward.

77
0:03:31.206,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If everyone on your team has been pulling long hours,

78
0:03:34.173,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and you notice that one of your colleagues seems particularly deflated or anxious,

79
0:03:39.298,000 --> 0:03:41,000
you can acknowledge that and show some empathy,

80
0:03:41.526,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but then try to give them something actionable

81
0:03:43.726,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that they could hold on to.

82
0:03:45.057,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And in this case,

83
0:03:46.232,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you could suggest that you go to your manager

84
0:03:48.376,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and ask that your weekly meeting

85
0:03:49.926,000 --> 0:03:51,000
be pushed back a day so you both have more time to work.

86
0:03:52.696,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You're showing you're invested in their success,

87
0:03:55.006,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but also that you care about their well-being.

88
0:03:57.173,000 --> 0:03:59,000
When we can be honest about what we feel,

89
0:03:59.236,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and freely suggest ideas, make mistakes

90
0:04:02.069,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and just not have to hide every piece of who we are,

91
0:04:05.243,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we're much more likely to stay at the company for a long time.

92
0:04:08.545,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We're also happier and more productive.

93
0:04:11.084,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So take a moment to reflect on the emotional expression

94
0:04:14.896,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that you bring to work each day.

95
0:04:16.949,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And if you are prone to oversharing, try editing.

96
0:04:20.076,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if you're a little bit more reserved,

97
0:04:22.126,000 --> 0:04:24,000
look for moments when you can open up to your colleagues

98
0:04:24.836,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and be a bit vulnerable.

99
0:04:26.05,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And chances are, there will be a big difference

100
0:04:28.375,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in how people respond to you.

101
0:04:30.006,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And selective vulnerability might just become

102
0:04:32.456,000 --> 0:04:34,000
one of your most valuable tools.

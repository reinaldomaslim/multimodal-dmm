1
0:00:12.904,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Since 1997, researchers at the University of Sussex

2
0:00:17.81,000 --> 0:00:2,000
have monitored global trends in armed conflict.

3
0:00:21.863,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Their research clearly shows

4
0:00:25.067,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that in Africa, over the last 10 years,

5
0:00:28.895,000 --> 0:00:31,000
armed conflict has gone up by sevenfold.

6
0:00:32.927,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let's think about that:

7
0:00:34.847,000 --> 0:00:37,000
sevenfold in a single decade.

8
0:00:40.622,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Why is this?

9
0:00:42.829,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We believe, as oxygen is to fire,

10
0:00:46.186,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so are unemployed youth to insecurity.

11
0:00:50.546,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We have a lot of youth on this continent.

12
0:00:54.791,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Youth like Sandra,

13
0:00:57.829,000 --> 0:01:02,000
who, on a Saturday morning in March 2014,

14
0:01:02.863,000 --> 0:01:06,000
woke up excited at the prospects of getting a coveted job

15
0:01:07.144,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at the Nigerian Immigration Services.

16
0:01:10.263,000 --> 0:01:12,000
She kissed her daughter goodbye,

17
0:01:13.106,000 --> 0:01:14,000
left her home,

18
0:01:15.082,000 --> 0:01:16,000
never to return.

19
0:01:16.632,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Sandra and 15 other young Nigerians died that day, applying for a job,

20
0:01:24.942,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the ensuing stampede,

21
0:01:27.601,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as tens of thousands of people applied for a few thousand open positions.

22
0:01:38.431,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In the last 20 years, 20 million youth have entered the Nigerian workforce alone.

23
0:01:45.939,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Today, half our population is under the age of 18.

24
0:01:52.164,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's almost 80 million people

25
0:01:55.434,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that will be entering the workforce in the next 20 years.

26
0:02:01.421,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My friends,

27
0:02:03.422,000 --> 0:02:07,000
if a wave of 20 million people entering the workforce

28
0:02:08.437,000 --> 0:02:1,000
triggered Niger Delta crisis,

29
0:02:11.768,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Fulani herdsmen crisis

30
0:02:14.061,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and Boko Haram,

31
0:02:16.768,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I ask you:

32
0:02:18.193,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What will four times that number do?

33
0:02:23.614,000 --> 0:02:26,000
To do my part to solve this challenge,

34
0:02:26.979,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in 2012, I moved to a small village in northern Nigeria,

35
0:02:32.507,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the center of the area most recently hit

36
0:02:37.018,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by the spread of insecurity, brutal bombings and searing poverty,

37
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with an idea:

38
0:02:46.522,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Could we create an economic buffer to halt the spread of this insecurity,

39
0:02:53.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
by unlocking the power of agriculture as a job-creation engine?

40
0:02:58.085,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We knew this had been done before in countries like Thailand,

41
0:03:02.093,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where, in 1980, they suffered from the same economic challenges as us.

42
0:03:07.577,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Today, however, Thailand produces two million cars a year --

43
0:03:13.005,000 --> 0:03:15,000
more than the United Kingdom --

44
0:03:15.537,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with over 30 percent of its workforce

45
0:03:18.427,000 --> 0:03:21,000
as highly commercial, profitable small farmers,

46
0:03:22.633,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with an unemployment rate of less than one percent.

47
0:03:29.793,000 --> 0:03:3,000
How did they do this?

48
0:03:31.69,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In the 80s, Thailand dramatically improved the productivity of its small farmers,

49
0:03:39.543,000 --> 0:03:43,000
ensuring that it was able to start to dominate

50
0:03:44.165,000 --> 0:03:45,000
export markets for produce.

51
0:03:47.141,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Building on this strength, they attracted investment

52
0:03:49.879,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and started to process,

53
0:03:52.244,000 --> 0:03:55,000
being able to export higher-value products like starch from cassava.

54
0:03:57.22,000 --> 0:04:,000
Finally, coupled with investment in education,

55
0:04:00.339,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they started to expand to even higher-value manufacturing.

56
0:04:06.966,000 --> 0:04:11,000
To make our idea a reality and follow a path similar to Thailand,

57
0:04:12.307,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we knew that we would have to sell young farmers on farming.

58
0:04:20.125,000 --> 0:04:22,000
A young man in northern Nigeria,

59
0:04:22.978,000 --> 0:04:26,000
for the purpose of today's discussion, we'll call "Saminu,"

60
0:04:27.466,000 --> 0:04:29,000
made it very clear to me that this would not be easy.

61
0:04:31.363,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Saminu grew up in a beautiful village in northern Nigeria.

62
0:04:35.571,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And he tells wondrous stories of playing for hours with his friends,

63
0:04:39.651,000 --> 0:04:41,000
running up and down the beautiful rock formations

64
0:04:42.144,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that dot the countryside around his home.

65
0:04:45.839,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Despite this beauty, Saminu knew

66
0:04:48.419,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that the first chance he got, he would leave.

67
0:04:52.315,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He did not want to be a farmer.

68
0:04:55.431,000 --> 0:05:,000
Growing up, he saw his parents work so hard as farmers,

69
0:05:00.86,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but barely get by.

70
0:05:03.934,000 --> 0:05:07,000
As he says, they had "babu" -- nothing.

71
0:05:11.266,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Young farmers like Saminu

72
0:05:15.909,000 --> 0:05:17,000
do not have access to the cash

73
0:05:18.631,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to buy the farming products to pair with their hard work

74
0:05:22.082,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to be successful.

75
0:05:26.462,000 --> 0:05:27,000
When their meager harvest came in,

76
0:05:28.311,000 --> 0:05:33,000
desperate for cash, they would sell most of it at fire-sale prices,

77
0:05:33.594,000 --> 0:05:37,000
when, if they could just wait six months, they could get 50 percent more.

78
0:05:38.538,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Hence, Saminu left to the city,

79
0:05:44.18,000 --> 0:05:47,000
where he soon realized that life was not easy.

80
0:05:48.236,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He borrowed a very old motorcycle,

81
0:05:52.276,000 --> 0:05:55,000
with tires that were more patches than tires,

82
0:05:55.839,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to become a motorcycle taxi driver.

83
0:05:59.553,000 --> 0:06:02,000
He lived in constant fear every day

84
0:06:03.069,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that his precious, tattered motorcycle would be ripped away from him,

85
0:06:07.911,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as it had before.

86
0:06:11.934,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But he got it back, thankfully.

87
0:06:16.315,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He knew of others, however, who were not so lucky --

88
0:06:19.617,000 --> 0:06:21,000
other young men who, once they'd lost their motorcycles,

89
0:06:22.347,000 --> 0:06:23,000
became destitute.

90
0:06:25.268,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Angry, these young men set out to wreak vengeance

91
0:06:28.189,000 --> 0:06:31,000
on a society that they believed had turned its back on them.

92
0:06:34.617,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Saminu told me that they joined insurgent groups,

93
0:06:40.553,000 --> 0:06:44,000
often acting as getaway drivers in bombings and kidnappings.

94
0:06:47.14,000 --> 0:06:5,000
To end this cycle of insecurity,

95
0:06:50.79,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we must make farming a viable choice.

96
0:06:53.878,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We must ensure that these young men, on their small farms,

97
0:06:57.784,000 --> 0:07:,000
can earn enough money to make a life for themselves;

98
0:07:01.601,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to make a future.

99
0:07:03.323,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The question now is how.

100
0:07:06.315,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Recognizing that Africa has grassroot-level leadership,

101
0:07:10.204,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we simply developed a model

102
0:07:12.871,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to bring the professional management and investment to scale

103
0:07:16.331,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to these grassroot leaders.

104
0:07:20.006,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We called it "Babban Gona" -- "great farm" in Hausa.

105
0:07:26.948,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Upon reaching the village in 2012,

106
0:07:31.543,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I traveled from community to community,

107
0:07:33.829,000 --> 0:07:36,000
trying to convince people of our idea,

108
0:07:38.152,000 --> 0:07:42,000
trying to recruit farmer members.

109
0:07:43.319,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We failed woefully that first year,

110
0:07:46.895,000 --> 0:07:48,000
barely recruiting 100 brave souls.

111
0:07:51.053,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But we persevered.

112
0:07:52.99,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We kept doing what we promised,

113
0:07:56.22,000 --> 0:07:59,000
slowly we gained their trust.

114
0:08:02.038,000 --> 0:08:03,000
More farmers joined us.

115
0:08:04.315,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Fast-forward now five years.

116
0:08:06.377,000 --> 0:08:08,000
With a passionate and committed team

117
0:08:10.165,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and the tremendous support of our partners,

118
0:08:14.695,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we grew dramatically,

119
0:08:17.509,000 --> 0:08:2,000
today, serving 20,000 small farmers,

120
0:08:21.481,000 --> 0:08:27,000
enabling them to double their yields and triple their net income

121
0:08:28.42,000 --> 0:08:29,000
relative to their peers.

122
0:08:31.552,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We are very proud of the fact --

123
0:08:33.673,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

124
0:08:38.72,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Fast-forward three years,

125
0:08:40.942,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Saminu has earned enough money

126
0:08:42.53,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to buy three goats for his mother to start a goat-rearing business,

127
0:08:47.251,000 --> 0:08:49,000
owns his own retail store

128
0:08:50.188,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and bought not one, but two motorcycles,

129
0:08:55.498,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with vanity license plates: "Babban Gona."

130
0:08:58.99,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

131
0:09:04.956,000 --> 0:09:05,000
My friends,

132
0:09:07.322,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the next 20 years,

133
0:09:09.702,000 --> 0:09:13,000
over 400 million Saminus are entering the African workforce,

134
0:09:14.855,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with potentially half of them having opportunities in agriculture.

135
0:09:19.704,000 --> 0:09:23,000
To unlock these opportunities, through models similar to ours,

136
0:09:24.659,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they would require 150 billion dollars a year in financing.

137
0:09:32.026,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is a big number.

138
0:09:34.278,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But if we can tap into commercial debt, it is a small number --

139
0:09:39.748,000 --> 0:09:42,000
only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today,

140
0:09:43.687,000 --> 0:09:46,000
10 cents out of every 100 dollars.

141
0:09:47.347,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This is why we designed our model

142
0:09:49.29,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to be very different from conventional agricultural development programs.

143
0:09:53.363,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In a few short years, we have shown that our model works,

144
0:09:58.631,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is high-impact and can turn a profit,

145
0:10:02.441,000 --> 0:10:03,000
attracting commercial investors

146
0:10:04.141,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that do not typically invest in small farmers in Africa.

147
0:10:09.807,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Imagine a world where millions of young men across Africa,

148
0:10:15.069,000 --> 0:10:17,000
hardworking young men,

149
0:10:17.323,000 --> 0:10:18,000
have other options.

150
0:10:19.998,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I know these driven, ambitious young men

151
0:10:26.059,000 --> 0:10:28,000
will make the right choice.

152
0:10:31.099,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We can realize this dream

153
0:10:36.268,000 --> 0:10:4,000
if they have a choice.

154
0:10:41.172,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Thank you.

155
0:10:42.348,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

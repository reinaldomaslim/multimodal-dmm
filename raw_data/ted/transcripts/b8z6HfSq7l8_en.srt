1
0:00:13.179,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So last year, on the Fourth of July,

2
0:00:15.523,000 --> 0:00:17,000
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

3
0:00:18.022,000 --> 0:00:2,000
discovered the Higgs boson.

4
0:00:20.312,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It was a historical day.

5
0:00:22.28,000 --> 0:00:24,000
There's no doubt that from now on,

6
0:00:24.575,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the Fourth of July will be remembered

7
0:00:26.409,000 --> 0:00:28,000
not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,

8
0:00:28.851,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.

9
0:00:32.685,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Well, at least, here at CERN.

10
0:00:35.117,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day

11
0:00:39.272,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was that there was no big surprise.

12
0:00:41.771,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In the eye of a theoretical physicist,

13
0:00:44.37,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the Higgs boson is a clever explanation

14
0:00:46.263,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of how some elementary particles gain mass,

15
0:00:49.786,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory

16
0:00:52.622,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and incomplete solution.

17
0:00:54.828,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Too many questions are left unanswered.

18
0:00:57.852,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The Higgs boson does not share the beauty,

19
0:01:00.687,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the symmetry, the elegance,

20
0:01:02.572,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of the rest of the elementary particle world.

21
0:01:05.3,000 --> 0:01:08,000
For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists

22
0:01:08.922,000 --> 0:01:1,000
believe that the Higgs boson could not

23
0:01:11.864,000 --> 0:01:13,000
be the full story.

24
0:01:14.346,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We were expecting new particles and new phenomena

25
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:19,000
accompanying the Higgs boson.

26
0:01:19.65,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Instead, so far, the measurements

27
0:01:21.968,000 --> 0:01:24,000
coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles

28
0:01:25.726,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or unexpected phenomena.

29
0:01:27.875,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Of course, the verdict is not definitive.

30
0:01:31.528,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In 2015, the LHC will almost double

31
0:01:35.522,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the energy of the colliding protons,

32
0:01:38.213,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and these more powerful collisions

33
0:01:40.284,000 --> 0:01:44,000
will allow us to explore further the particle world,

34
0:01:44.868,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and we will certainly learn much more.

35
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But for the moment, since we have found

36
0:01:51.146,000 --> 0:01:54,000
no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose

37
0:01:54.295,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that the particles that we know today,

38
0:01:57.459,000 --> 0:01:58,000
including the Higgs boson,

39
0:01:59.315,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are the only elementary particles in nature,

40
0:02:02.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
even at energies much larger

41
0:02:05.344,000 --> 0:02:07,000
than what we have explored so far.

42
0:02:08.11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.

43
0:02:12.742,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We will find a surprising and intriguing result

44
0:02:16.174,000 --> 0:02:19,000
about our universe, and to explain my point,

45
0:02:19.973,000 --> 0:02:22,000
let me first tell you what the Higgs is about,

46
0:02:23.849,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and to do so, we have to go back

47
0:02:26.983,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to one tenth of a billionth of a second

48
0:02:31.34,000 --> 0:02:32,000
after the Big Bang.

49
0:02:32.871,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And according to the Higgs theory,

50
0:02:34.912,000 --> 0:02:37,000
at that instant, a dramatic event took place

51
0:02:38.278,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in the universe.

52
0:02:39.869,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Space-time underwent a phase transition.

53
0:02:44.66,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was something very similar to the phase transition

54
0:02:47.737,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that occurs when water turns into ice

55
0:02:51.282,000 --> 0:02:52,000
below zero degrees.

56
0:02:53.243,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But in our case, the phase transition

57
0:02:56.183,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is not a change in the way the molecules

58
0:02:58.714,000 --> 0:03:,000
are arranged inside the material,

59
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but is about a change

60
0:03:02.888,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of the very fabric of space-time.

61
0:03:06.514,000 --> 0:03:08,000
During this phase transition, empty space

62
0:03:09.14,000 --> 0:03:11,000
became filled with a substance

63
0:03:11.812,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that we now call Higgs field.

64
0:03:14.844,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And this substance may seem invisible to us,

65
0:03:17.173,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it has a physical reality.

66
0:03:19.851,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It surrounds us all the time,

67
0:03:21.909,000 --> 0:03:24,000
just like the air we breathe in this room.

68
0:03:25.61,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And some elementary particles interact

69
0:03:27.928,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with this substance, gaining energy in the process.

70
0:03:31.756,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And this intrinsic energy is what we call

71
0:03:34.831,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the mass of a particle,

72
0:03:36.964,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC

73
0:03:40.217,000 --> 0:03:44,000
has conclusively proved that this substance is real,

74
0:03:44.749,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.

75
0:03:48.668,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.

76
0:03:52.112,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But this story is far more interesting than that.

77
0:03:56.855,000 --> 0:03:58,000
By studying the Higgs theory,

78
0:03:59.166,000 --> 0:04:01,000
theoretical physicists discovered,

79
0:04:01.526,000 --> 0:04:02,000
not through an experiment

80
0:04:03.43,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but with the power of mathematics,

81
0:04:05.906,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist

82
0:04:09.618,000 --> 0:04:12,000
only in the form that we observe today.

83
0:04:12.955,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid,

84
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,

85
0:04:22.572,000 --> 0:04:25,000
could exist in two states.

86
0:04:25.926,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Besides the known Higgs state,

87
0:04:28.236,000 --> 0:04:31,000
there could be a second state in which the Higgs field

88
0:04:31.383,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is billions and billions times denser

89
0:04:34.919,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than what we observe today,

90
0:04:36.964,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the mere existence of another state

91
0:04:40.451,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of the Higgs field poses a potential problem.

92
0:04:44.696,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is because, according to the laws

93
0:04:47.934,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of quantum mechanics, it is possible

94
0:04:50.627,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to have transitions between two states,

95
0:04:53.459,000 --> 0:04:55,000
even in the presence of an energy barrier

96
0:04:56.408,000 --> 0:04:58,000
separating the two states,

97
0:04:59.036,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and the phenomenon is called,

98
0:05:01.245,000 --> 0:05:05,000
quite appropriately, quantum tunneling.

99
0:05:05.387,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Because of quantum tunneling,

100
0:05:07.278,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I could disappear from this room

101
0:05:09.811,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and reappear in the next room,

102
0:05:13.133,000 --> 0:05:16,000
practically penetrating the wall.

103
0:05:16.528,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But don't expect me to actually perform the trick

104
0:05:19.343,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in front of your eyes, because the probability

105
0:05:21.921,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.

106
0:05:26.309,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You would have to wait a really long time

107
0:05:28.907,000 --> 0:05:3,000
before it happens, but believe me,

108
0:05:31.039,000 --> 0:05:34,000
quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,

109
0:05:34.216,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and it has been observed in many systems.

110
0:05:37.411,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For instance, the tunnel diode,

111
0:05:39.973,000 --> 0:05:41,000
a component used in electronics,

112
0:05:42.17,000 --> 0:05:44,000
works thanks to the wonders

113
0:05:44.592,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of quantum tunneling.

114
0:05:46.912,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But let's go back to the Higgs field.

115
0:05:49.204,000 --> 0:05:53,000
If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,

116
0:05:53.767,000 --> 0:05:55,000
then, because of quantum tunneling,

117
0:05:56.121,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a bubble of this state could suddenly appear

118
0:05:59.834,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in a certain place of the universe at a certain time,

119
0:06:03.076,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.

120
0:06:06.841,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Bubbles of vapor form inside the water,

121
0:06:09.93,000 --> 0:06:12,000
then they expand, turning liquid into gas.

122
0:06:13.786,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state

123
0:06:18.59,000 --> 0:06:21,000
could come into existence because of quantum tunneling.

124
0:06:22.017,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The bubble would then expand at the speed of light,

125
0:06:24.854,000 --> 0:06:27,000
invading all space, and turning the Higgs field

126
0:06:28.34,000 --> 0:06:31,000
from the familiar state into a new state.

127
0:06:31.989,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.

128
0:06:36.15,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We may not realize it in ordinary life,

129
0:06:38.895,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical

130
0:06:42.1,000 --> 0:06:44,000
for the structure of matter.

131
0:06:44.745,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,

132
0:06:48.818,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying

133
0:06:51.762,000 --> 0:06:54,000
inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,

134
0:06:55.448,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and hydrogen would be

135
0:06:57.788,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the only possible chemical element in the universe.

136
0:07:02.14,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,

137
0:07:05.151,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is not just a few times more intense than today,

138
0:07:08.965,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but billions of times,

139
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,

140
0:07:14.362,000 --> 0:07:17,000
all atomic matter would collapse.

141
0:07:17.515,000 --> 0:07:21,000
No molecular structures would be possible, no life.

142
0:07:22.005,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So, I wonder, is it possible

143
0:07:25.343,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that in the future, the Higgs field

144
0:07:27.929,000 --> 0:07:29,000
will undergo a phase transition and,

145
0:07:30.494,000 --> 0:07:33,000
through quantum tunneling, will be transformed

146
0:07:33.623,000 --> 0:07:37,000
into this nasty, ultra-dense state?

147
0:07:38.31,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate

148
0:07:41.835,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of the Higgs field in our universe?

149
0:07:44.918,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And the crucial ingredient necessary

150
0:07:47.169,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.

151
0:07:51.555,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And experiments at the LHC found that the mass

152
0:07:55.666,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.

153
0:07:59.94,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is tiny when expressed in familiar units,

154
0:08:02.976,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because it's equal to something like

155
0:08:04.296,000 --> 0:08:06,000
10 to the minus 22 grams,

156
0:08:06.503,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but it is large in particle physics units,

157
0:08:10.473,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because it is equal to the weight

158
0:08:12.577,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of an entire molecule

159
0:08:14.823,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of a DNA constituent.

160
0:08:17.243,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So armed with this information from the LHC,

161
0:08:20.63,000 --> 0:08:21,000
together with some colleagues here at CERN,

162
0:08:22.574,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we computed the probability

163
0:08:24.483,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that our universe could quantum tunnel

164
0:08:27.498,000 --> 0:08:3,000
into the ultra-dense Higgs state,

165
0:08:30.616,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and we found a very intriguing result.

166
0:08:34.293,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Our calculations showed

167
0:08:36.442,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass

168
0:08:39.614,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is very special.

169
0:08:41.459,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It has just the right value

170
0:08:44.378,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to keep the universe hanging

171
0:08:47.071,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in an unstable situation.

172
0:08:49.641,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration

173
0:08:52.897,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that has lasted so far

174
0:08:54.946,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but that will eventually collapse.

175
0:08:57.991,000 --> 0:09:,000
So according to these calculations,

176
0:09:01.17,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we are like campers

177
0:09:03.2,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who accidentally set their tent

178
0:09:05.652,000 --> 0:09:06,000
at the edge of a cliff.

179
0:09:07.446,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And eventually, the Higgs field

180
0:09:09.236,000 --> 0:09:1,000
will undergo a phase transition

181
0:09:11.172,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and matter will collapse into itself.

182
0:09:14.216,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So is this how humanity is going to disappear?

183
0:09:17.66,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I don't think so.

184
0:09:19.415,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling

185
0:09:22.768,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of the Higgs field is not likely to occur

186
0:09:26.424,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the next 10 to the 100 years,

187
0:09:29.928,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and this is a very long time.

188
0:09:32.97,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's even longer than

189
0:09:34.738,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.

190
0:09:38.407,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:40.814,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Even so, we will be long gone by then.

192
0:09:44.605,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In about five billion years,

193
0:09:47.213,000 --> 0:09:49,000
our sun will become a red giant,

194
0:09:49.67,000 --> 0:09:51,000
as large as the Earth's orbit,

195
0:09:52.183,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and our Earth will be kaput,

196
0:09:55.46,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and in a thousand billion years,

197
0:09:57.817,000 --> 0:09:59,000
if dark energy keeps on fueling

198
0:10:00.103,000 --> 0:10:02,000
space expansion at the present rate,

199
0:10:02.938,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you will not even be able to see as far as your toes,

200
0:10:07.115,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because everything around you

201
0:10:08.812,000 --> 0:10:11,000
expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.

202
0:10:12.513,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So it is really unlikely

203
0:10:14.498,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.

204
0:10:18.368,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But the reason why I am interested

205
0:10:21.947,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in the transition of the Higgs field

206
0:10:23.959,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is because I want to address the question,

207
0:10:27.244,000 --> 0:10:31,000
why is the Higgs boson mass so special?

208
0:10:32.209,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Why is it just right to keep the universe

209
0:10:35.183,000 --> 0:10:38,000
at the edge of a phase transition?

210
0:10:38.673,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Theoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.

211
0:10:42.535,000 --> 0:10:44,000
More than how a phenomenon works,

212
0:10:45.21,000 --> 0:10:47,000
theoretical physicists are always interested in

213
0:10:47.682,000 --> 0:10:5,000
why a phenomenon works in the way it works.

214
0:10:50.914,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We think that this these "why" questions

215
0:10:54.276,000 --> 0:10:55,000
can give us clues

216
0:10:55.999,000 --> 0:10:58,000
about the fundamental principles of nature.

217
0:10:59.537,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And indeed, a possible answer to my question

218
0:11:03.442,000 --> 0:11:07,000
opens up new universes, literally.

219
0:11:07.806,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It has been speculated that our universe

220
0:11:11.247,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse

221
0:11:15.38,000 --> 0:11:17,000
made out of a multitude of bubbles,

222
0:11:17.943,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and each bubble is a different universe

223
0:11:20.159,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with different fundamental constants

224
0:11:22.053,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and different physical laws.

225
0:11:23.918,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And in this context, you can only talk about

226
0:11:25.924,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.

227
0:11:30.635,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Then the key to the mystery

228
0:11:32.978,000 --> 0:11:35,000
could lie in the statistical properties

229
0:11:36.241,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of the multiverse.

230
0:11:38.469,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It would be something like what happens

231
0:11:40.883,000 --> 0:11:42,000
with sand dunes on a beach.

232
0:11:43.12,000 --> 0:11:45,000
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes

233
0:11:45.992,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of any slope angle in a beach,

234
0:11:48.422,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes

235
0:11:52.583,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are typically around 30, 35 degrees.

236
0:11:56.053,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And the reason is simple:

237
0:11:57.721,000 --> 0:12:,000
because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.

238
0:12:01.399,000 --> 0:12:03,000
As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes

239
0:12:04.283,000 --> 0:12:07,000
have slope angles around the critical value,

240
0:12:08.202,000 --> 0:12:09,000
near to collapse.

241
0:12:10.186,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And something similar could happen

242
0:12:13.183,000 --> 0:12:17,000
for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.

243
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In the majority of bubble universes,

244
0:12:20.592,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the Higgs mass could be around the critical value,

245
0:12:23.649,000 --> 0:12:26,000
near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,

246
0:12:27.245,000 --> 0:12:28,000
because of two competing effects,

247
0:12:29.192,000 --> 0:12:32,000
just as in the case of sand.

248
0:12:32.778,000 --> 0:12:35,000
My story does not have an end,

249
0:12:35.923,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because we still don't know the end of the story.

250
0:12:39.658,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This is science in progress,

251
0:12:42.946,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and to solve the mystery, we need more data,

252
0:12:46.78,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues

253
0:12:51.396,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to this story.

254
0:12:54.017,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Just one number, the Higgs boson mass,

255
0:12:57.847,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and yet, out of this number we learn so much.

256
0:13:03.176,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles

257
0:13:06.223,000 --> 0:13:08,000
are all there is in the universe,

258
0:13:08.259,000 --> 0:13:1,000
even beyond the domain explored so far.

259
0:13:10.965,000 --> 0:13:13,000
From this, we discovered that the Higgs field

260
0:13:14.733,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that permeates space-time may be standing

261
0:13:18.176,000 --> 0:13:22,000
on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,

262
0:13:22.733,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we discovered that this may be a hint

263
0:13:26.283,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that our universe is only a grain of sand

264
0:13:30.316,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in a giant beach, the multiverse.

265
0:13:33.929,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.

266
0:13:37.18,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That's how physics works: A single measurement

267
0:13:40.863,000 --> 0:13:42,000
can put us on the road to a new understanding

268
0:13:43.727,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of the universe

269
0:13:45.39,000 --> 0:13:48,000
or it can send us down a blind alley.

270
0:13:48.409,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But whichever it turns out to be,

271
0:13:50.973,000 --> 0:13:53,000
there is one thing I'm sure of:

272
0:13:54.165,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The journey will be full of surprises.

273
0:13:57.514,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Thank you.

274
0:13:58.887,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

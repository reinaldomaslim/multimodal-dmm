Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:13.122,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am sorry I cannot show you my face,

3
0:00:17.119,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because if I do, the bad guys will come for me.

4
0:00:22.205,000 --> 0:00:26,000
My journey started 14 years ago.

5
0:00:26.293,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.

6
0:00:30.705,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Then I got a scoop.

7
0:00:33.407,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The scoop was quite a very simple story.

8
0:00:36.826,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Police officers were taking bribes

9
0:00:39.43,000 --> 0:00:42,000
from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.

10
0:00:42.966,000 --> 0:00:44,000
As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it

11
0:00:45.768,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,

12
0:00:49.937,000 --> 0:00:5,000
since everybody knew that it was happening,

13
0:00:51.825,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.

14
0:00:55.394,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I decided to go there

15
0:00:57.629,000 --> 0:01:,000
and act as a seller.

16
0:01:01.594,000 --> 0:01:04,000
As part of selling, I was able to document

17
0:01:04.847,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the hard core evidence.

18
0:01:07.639,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The impact was great.

19
0:01:10.161,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was fantastic.

20
0:01:12.722,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This was what many call immersion journalism,

21
0:01:16.452,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or undercover journalism.

22
0:01:19.021,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I am an undercover journalist.

23
0:01:23.269,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My journalism is hinged on three basic principles:

24
0:01:27.99,000 --> 0:01:31,000
naming, shaming and jailing.

25
0:01:32.79,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Journalism is about results.

26
0:01:34.66,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's about affecting your community or your society

27
0:01:38.399,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the most progressive way.

28
0:01:41.036,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I have worked on this for over 14 years,

29
0:01:45.594,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I can tell you, the results are very good.

30
0:01:48.826,000 --> 0:01:5,000
One story that comes to mind

31
0:01:51.057,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in my undercover pieces

32
0:01:53.201,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is "Spirit Child."

33
0:01:55.412,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It was about children who were born with deformities,

34
0:01:59.488,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and their parents felt that once they were born

35
0:02:02.233,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with those deformities,

36
0:02:03.922,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they were not good enough to live in the society,

37
0:02:06.045,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so they were given some concoction to take

38
0:02:09.153,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and as a result they died.

39
0:02:11.73,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So I built a prosthetic baby,

40
0:02:14.547,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I went into the village,

41
0:02:16.697,000 --> 0:02:2,000
pretended as though this baby had been born

42
0:02:20.845,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.

43
0:02:24.932,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They got themselves ready.

44
0:02:27.507,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,

45
0:02:31.093,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and they came that fateful morning

46
0:02:33.633,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to come and kill the child.

47
0:02:36.469,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.

48
0:02:40.488,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They put it on fire. It was boiling hot,

49
0:02:43.408,000 --> 0:02:45,000
getting ready to give to the kids.

50
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,

51
0:02:47.855,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they were on standby,

52
0:02:50.528,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and just as the concoction was ready,

53
0:02:53.764,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and they were about to give it to the kids,

54
0:02:56.864,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I phoned the police,

55
0:02:58.813,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and fortunately they came and busted them.

56
0:03:02.982,000 --> 0:03:04,000
As I speak now, they are before the courts.

57
0:03:05.934,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Don't forget the key principles:

58
0:03:07.748,000 --> 0:03:09,000
naming, shaming and jailing.

59
0:03:10.574,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The court process is taking place,

60
0:03:12.587,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I'm very sure at the end of the day

61
0:03:14.67,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we will find them, and we will put them

62
0:03:17.119,000 --> 0:03:19,000
where they belong too.

63
0:03:19.862,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Another key story that comes to mind,

64
0:03:22.55,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which relates to this spirit child phenomenon,

65
0:03:26.897,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is "The Spell of the Albinos."

66
0:03:32.373,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,

67
0:03:35.864,000 --> 0:03:37,000
children who are born with albinism

68
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
are sometimes considered as being unfit

69
0:03:42.293,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to live in society.

70
0:03:44.992,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Their bodies are chopped up with machetes

71
0:03:48.88,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and are supposed to be used for some concoctions

72
0:03:52.208,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or some potions for people to get money --

73
0:03:55.09,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or so many, many stories people would tell about it.

74
0:03:58.885,000 --> 0:04:,000
It was time to go undercover again.

75
0:04:01.441,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So I went undercover as a man who was interested

76
0:04:04.89,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in this particular business, of course.

77
0:04:07.023,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Again, a prosthetic arm was built.

78
0:04:09.593,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera

79
0:04:13.172,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm

80
0:04:17.916,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and they were ready to use it to prepare

81
0:04:20.066,000 --> 0:04:23,000
those potions for people.

82
0:04:23.73,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,

83
0:04:27.306,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government

84
0:04:30.448,000 --> 0:04:34,000
could only take action because the evidence was available.

85
0:04:34.637,000 --> 0:04:37,000
My journalism is about hard core evidence.

86
0:04:38.532,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence

87
0:04:40.931,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that you have stolen.

88
0:04:42.434,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I show you how you stole it

89
0:04:44.751,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and when, or what you used

90
0:04:46.471,000 --> 0:04:48,000
what you had stolen to do.

91
0:04:48.739,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?

92
0:04:53.309,000 --> 0:04:55,000
My kind of journalism is a product

93
0:04:55.753,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of my society.

94
0:04:59.17,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I know that sometimes

95
0:05:02.348,000 --> 0:05:05,000
people have their own criticisms

96
0:05:06.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
about undercover journalism.

97
0:05:09.508,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets

98
0:05:13.686,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and put it on the table,

99
0:05:16.64,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so that we should not be afraid.

100
0:05:19.955,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.

101
0:05:25.738,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.

102
0:05:29.426,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I didn't utter a word.

103
0:05:31.816,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But my colleagues didn't know.

104
0:05:33.674,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So after collecting the money,

105
0:05:36.895,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.

106
0:05:40.023,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that

107
0:05:43.458,000 --> 0:05:44,000
since I was the leader of the group,

108
0:05:44.975,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I told my colleagues that if they come,

109
0:05:47.972,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we will arrest them.

110
0:05:49.273,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].

111
0:05:53.5,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I've never stepped there before.

112
0:05:55.084,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So I'm surprised.

113
0:05:56.051,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You see a hand counting money just in front of me.

114
0:06:01.865,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The next moment, you see the money in my hands,

115
0:06:05.209,000 --> 0:06:08,000
counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.

116
0:06:08.53,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I have not done any business with anybody.

Reporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter

118

Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,

119
0:06:15.616,000 --> 0:06:17,000
he just smiled and gave this video extract

120
0:06:18.49,000 --> 0:06:22,000
he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.

And here was him, denying.

126

But you see, when you have the hard core evidence,

you are able to affect society.

is not something which is unknown to many of us,

0:08:31.317,000 --> 0:08:34,000
issues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny

162
0:08:35.297,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that it ever happens.

163
0:08:36.747,000 --> 0:08:39,000
How can you obtain the hard core evidence?

164
0:08:40.111,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"]

165
0:08:44.011,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.

166
0:08:48.197,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,

167
0:08:51.267,000 --> 0:08:55,000
one of my friends, from his sick bed till death,

168
0:08:55.823,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.

169
0:08:59.464,000 --> 0:09:02,000
There were issues of bad food being served

170
0:09:02.546,000 --> 0:09:06,000
as I recall that some of the food I ate

171
0:09:07.456,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is just not good for a human being.

172
0:09:11.717,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Toilet facilities: very bad.

173
0:09:15.868,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend --

174
0:09:20.292,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and that's what I call proper,

175
0:09:23.008,000 --> 0:09:26,000
when four of us are on a manhole.

176
0:09:26.417,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is something that if you narrate it to somebody,

177
0:09:30.157,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the person wouldn't believe it.

178
0:09:31.991,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The only way that you can let the person believe

179
0:09:34.197,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is when you show hard core evidence.

180
0:09:36.309,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Of course, drugs were abundant.

181
0:09:39.437,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,

182
0:09:42.182,000 --> 0:09:45,000
faster even, in the prison than outside the prison.

183
0:09:45.885,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Evil in the society is an extreme disease.

184
0:09:50.596,000 --> 0:09:51,000
If you have extreme diseases,

185
0:09:52.518,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you need to get extreme remedies.

186
0:09:55.445,000 --> 0:09:57,000
My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents

187
0:09:58.179,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or other countries,

188
0:09:59.861,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent

189
0:10:03.309,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of Africa, because usually, when people talk

190
0:10:05.517,000 --> 0:10:07,000
about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?

191
0:10:08.242,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Show me the evidence."

192
0:10:09.423,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I say, "This is the evidence."

193
0:10:11.328,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.

194
0:10:16.209,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You see, we on the continent are able

195
0:10:19.729,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to tell the story better because we face the conditions

196
0:10:22.313,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and we see the conditions.

197
0:10:24.713,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That is why I was particularly excited

198
0:10:26.5,000 --> 0:10:28,000
when we launched our "Africa Investigates" series

199
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
where we investigated a lot of African countries.

200
0:10:32.081,000 --> 0:10:35,000
As a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,

201
0:10:35.732,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we are moving on to World Investigates.

202
0:10:38.27,000 --> 0:10:4,000
By the end of it, a lot more bad guys

203
0:10:40.913,000 --> 0:10:43,000
on our continent will be put behind bars.

204
0:10:44.543,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This will not stop.

205
0:10:46.17,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,

206
0:10:49.097,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because I know that when evil men destroy,

207
0:10:52.525,000 --> 0:10:53,000
good men must build and bind.

208
0:10:54.513,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you very much.

209
0:10:55.786,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

210
0:11:05.323,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

211
0:11:07.021,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I have some questions for you.

212
0:11:09.269,000 --> 0:11:13,000
How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?

213
0:11:13.499,000 --> 0:11:15,000
AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about

214
0:11:15.714,000 --> 0:11:17,000
setting the priorities right, so we got people

215
0:11:18.58,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to take me to court.

216
0:11:20.418,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I went through the very legal process,

217
0:11:22.634,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because at the end of the day, the prison authorities

218
0:11:24.858,000 --> 0:11:26,000
want to check whether indeed you have been there or not,

219
0:11:27.474,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and that's how I got in there.

220
0:11:29.488,000 --> 0:11:3,000
CA: So someone sued you in court,

221
0:11:31.266,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and they took you there, and you were in remand custody

222
0:11:34.073,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for part of it, and you did that deliberately.

223
0:11:36.514,000 --> 0:11:37,000
AAA: Yes, yes.

224
0:11:38.205,000 --> 0:11:41,000
CA: Talk to me just about fear

225
0:11:41.368,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and how you manage that,

226
0:11:43.177,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because you're regularly putting your life at risk.

227
0:11:45.81,000 --> 0:11:46,000
How do you do that?

228
0:11:47.373,000 --> 0:11:5,000
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.

229
0:11:50.563,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.

230
0:11:52.777,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear

231
0:11:55.847,000 --> 0:11:57,000
whenever I am sure that all the steps

232
0:11:58.327,000 --> 0:12:01,000
have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team

233
0:12:01.535,000 --> 0:12:04,000
who help ensure that the safety and all the systems

234
0:12:04.9,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are put in place, but you've got to take

235
0:12:06.845,000 --> 0:12:08,000
very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.

236
0:12:09.596,000 --> 0:12:11,000
If you don't, you will end up losing your life.

237
0:12:12.212,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place,

238
0:12:14.716,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,

239
0:12:16.804,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but it's a hazard of a profession.

240
0:12:19.46,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I mean, everybody has their hazard.

241
0:12:21.013,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And once you say that is yours,

242
0:12:22.946,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you've got to take it, as and when it comes.

243
0:12:25.254,000 --> 0:12:27,000
CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work

244
0:12:27.945,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and you've taught us a story

245
0:12:29.215,000 --> 0:12:32,000
like no story I think any of us have heard before.

246
0:12:32.462,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.

247
0:12:36.306,000 --> 0:12:37,000
AAA: Thank you.

248
0:12:37.43,000 --> 0:12:41,000
CA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)

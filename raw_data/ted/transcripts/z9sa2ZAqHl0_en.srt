1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because I have no form

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of PowerPoint presentation.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So what I'm going to do

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is, every now and again, I will make this gesture,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you can imagine what you'd like to see.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I do a radio show.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's about science, it's about rationalism.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So therefore, we get a lot of complaints

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
every single week --

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
complaints including one we get very often,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
celebrates the idea of vivisection.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We have made it quite clear to these people

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that an infinite monkey cage is roomy.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We also had someone else who said,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
An infinite number of monkeys

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
could never write the works of Shakespeare.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We know this because they did an experiment."

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So the main element though, the main complaint we get --

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and one that I find most worrying --

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
on ruining the magic?

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You bring in science, and it ruins the magic."

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now I'm an arts graduate;

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I love myth and magic

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and existentialism and self-loathing.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That's what I do.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But I also don't understand

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
how it does ruin the magic.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
All of the magic, I think,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that may well be taken away by science

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is then replaced by something as wonderful.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Astrology, for instance:

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now astrology --

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we remove the banal idea

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that your life could be predicted;

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
who's wearing a hat.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That is gone.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We can see predictions of galaxies forming,

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is a wonderful thing.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
one day it would say,

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
"Not a good day for making plans.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You'll been engulfed by a red giant."

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And that to me as well,

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
well Many Worlds theory --

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
one of the most beautiful, fascinating,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
sometimes terrifying ideas

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from the quantum interpretation --

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is a wonderful thing.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That every person here, every decision that you've made today,

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
every decision you've made in your life,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you've not really made that decision,

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is made, each one going off into a new universe.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That is a wonderful idea.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If you ever think that your life is rubbish,

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
always remember

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
don't end it all.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Remember that in the majority of universes,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you don't even exist in the first place.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This to me, in its own strange way,

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is very, very comforting.

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But it's not gone.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Science actually says

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we will live forever.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, there is one proviso.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that gets this one go.

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But every single thing that makes us,

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
every atom in us,

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
has already created a myriad of different things

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and will go on to create a myriad of new things.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We have been mountains

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and apples and pulsars

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and other people's knees.

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
That is a good thing.

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Unlike the occupants of the universe,

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the universe itself is not wasteful.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We are all totally recyclable.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And when we die,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is a wonderful thing.

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Understanding, to me,

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
does not remove the wonder and the joy.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Why do you love me?"

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I can with all honesty

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
look her in the eye and say,

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"Because our pheromones

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
matched our olfactory receptors."

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Though I'll probably also say something

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
about her hair and personality as well.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And that is a wonderful thing there.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Love does not die because of that thing.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Pain doesn't go away either.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If someone punches me --

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and because of my personality,

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
this is recently a regular occurrence --

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I understand where the pain comes from.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It is basically momentum to energy

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
where the four-vector is constant -- that's what it is.

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But at no point can I react and go,

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
No, I just spit out a tooth.

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I have a son. His name is Archie.

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I'm very lucky,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because he's better than all the other children.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now I know you don't think that.

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You may well have your own children

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and think, "Oh no, my child's best."

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That's the wonderful thing about evolution --

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the predilection to believe

139
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that our child is best.

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing.

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and therefore we love it.

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
That is a wonderful thing.

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Though I should say that my son is best

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and is better than your children.

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I've done some tests.

148
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And all of these things to me

149
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
give such joy and excitement and wonder.

150
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for bad housework, for instance.

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You house is in a terrible state.

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Your partner is about to return.

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You think, what should I do?

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Do nothing.

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
All you have to do

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
say, "I'm so sorry.

160
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I stopped observing the house for a moment,

161
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and when I started observing again,

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
everything had happened."

163
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

164
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.

165
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
For me, it's a very, very important thing.

166
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Even on my journey up here --

167
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm sitting on a train.

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Every time I breathe in,

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I'm breathing in a million-billion-billion

172
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
atoms of oxygen.

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I'm sitting on a chair.

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Even though I know the chair is made of atoms

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and therefore actually in many ways empty space,

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I find it comfortable.

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I look out the window, and I realize

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that every single time we stop and I look out that window,

179
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
framed in that window,

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
wherever we are,

181
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I am observing more life

182
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than there is in the rest of the known universe

183
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
beyond the planet Earth.

184
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
If you go to the safari parks

185
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on Saturn or Jupiter,

186
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
you will be disappointed.

187
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I realize I'm observing this

188
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
with the brain, the human brain,

189
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the most complex thing in the known universe.

190
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That, to me, is an incredible thing.

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And do you know what, that might be enough.

192
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,

193
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"The more the universe seems comprehensible,

194
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the more it seems pointless."

195
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now for some people,

196
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.

197
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.

198
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I'm glad the universe is pointless.

199
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It means if I get to the end of my life,

200
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?

201
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
That's not the point."

202
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I can make my own purpose.

203
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You can make your own purpose.

204
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We have the individual power

205
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to go, "This is what I want to do."

206
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.

207
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I have chosen to make silly jokes

208
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.

209
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

211
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Applause)

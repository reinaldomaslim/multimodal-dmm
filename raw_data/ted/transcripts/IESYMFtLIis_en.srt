1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,

4
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe

5
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and so on. And within the last decade or two,

6
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
underlying many of these past collapses.

8
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But there were also plenty of places in the world

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
where societies have been developing for thousands of years

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
without any sign of a major collapse,

11
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.

13
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant

15
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to our situation today, because today as well, there are

16
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia

17
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.

19
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What about ourselves?

20
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid

21
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?

22
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Obviously the answer to this question is not going

23
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor

24
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away

25
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.

26
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?

27
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a

28
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through

29
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point

30
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.

31
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This is a European society with literate records,

32
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.

33
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,

34
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,

35
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and every one of them ended up dead.

36
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,

37
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts

38
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource

39
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,

40
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,

41
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which was a particular problem for them because

42
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.

43
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually

44
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is

45
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.

46
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder

47
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate

48
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting

49
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,

50
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?

51
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring

52
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that

53
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society

54
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

55
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --

56
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,

57
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.

58
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.

59
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --

60
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse

61
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit

62
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,

63
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which

64
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.

65
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,

66
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it

67
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its

68
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

69
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
cultural factors that made it difficult for them

70
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to solve their problems were: their commitments to a

71
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being

72
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,

73
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part

74
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.

75
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What about a society today?

76
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to

77
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager

78
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems

79
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
like the most pristine environment in the United States.

80
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.

81
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?

82
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste

83
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
have caused damage of billions of dollars.

84
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly

85
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas

86
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
from salinization, problems of forest management,

87
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:

88
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer

89
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation

90
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,

91
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --

92
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.

93
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies

94
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of

95
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,

96
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from

97
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
social security, investments and so on --

98
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.

99
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems

100
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems

101
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,

102
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:

103
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes

104
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today

105
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.

106
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,

107
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and to no government regulation; values that worked well

108
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.

109
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses

110
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.

111
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Are there any general conclusions that arise?

112
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage

113
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --

114
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain

115
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
common threads that emerge from these comparisons

116
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
of past societies that did or did not collapse

117
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread

118
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse

119
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies

120
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer

121
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades

122
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
after their peak, they collapse. For example,

123
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the

124
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building

125
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.

126
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place

127
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time

128
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.

129
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.

130
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's

131
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,

132
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.

133
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,

134
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,

135
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation

136
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still

137
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.

138
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So, this is a frequent theme:

139
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.

140
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned

141
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
about a society today, you should be looking not at the value

142
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should

143
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives

144
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme

145
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make

146
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors

147
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,

148
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as

149
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the most devastating case of complete deforestation?

150
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental

151
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against

152
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,

153
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them

154
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients

155
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from

156
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.

157
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust

158
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's

159
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.

160
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,

161
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are more fragile than others. And then finally,

162
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
another generalization. I'm now teaching a course

163
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses

164
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,

165
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?

166
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?

167
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?

168
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies

169
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?

170
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,

171
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
then maybe in the next century people will be asking,

172
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see

173
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?

174
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem

175
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been

176
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations

177
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
about why societies fail to solve their problems --

178
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,

179
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,

180
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
why do they fail to succeed in solving them?

181
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.

182
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,

183
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term

184
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term

185
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites

186
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
are able to insulate themselves from the consequences

187
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite

188
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite

189
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.

190
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
For example, among the Greenland Norse --

191
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted

192
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is more followers and more sheep and more resources

193
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs

194
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,

195
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made

196
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the chiefs powerful in the short run,

197
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but led to the society's collapse in the long run.

198
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute

199
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in the United States today. Especially because

200
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the decision makers in the United States are frequently

201
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
able to insulate themselves from consequences

202
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water

203
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and so on. And within the last couple of years,

204
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
it's been obvious that the elite in the business world

205
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
correctly perceive that they can advance

206
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
their short-term interest by doing things that are

207
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
good for them but bad for society as a whole,

208
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron

209
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and other businesses. They are quite correct

210
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that these things are good for them in the short term,

211
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
although bad for society in the long term.

212
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So, that's one general conclusion about why societies

213
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.

214
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And the other generalization that I want to mention

215
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is that it's particularly hard for a society to make

216
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving

217
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
strongly held values that are good in many circumstances

218
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but are poor in other circumstances. For example,

219
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,

220
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
were held together for four-and-a-half centuries

221
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
by their shared commitment to religion,

222
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --

223
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --

224
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
also made it difficult for them to change at the end

225
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.

226
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive

227
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in this remote outpost of European civilization

228
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
for 250 years has been their British identity.

229
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But today, their commitment to a British identity

230
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt

231
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult

232
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to change course when the things that get you in trouble

233
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
are the things that are also the source of your strength.

234
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
What's going to be the outcome today?

235
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs

236
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses

237
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,

238
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,

239
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
of soil, of climate change, invasive species,

240
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --

241
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --

242
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them

243
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,

244
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,

245
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest

246
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only

247
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
one year away from losing their loggable forest,

248
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular

249
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,

250
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do

251
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
about the world's environmental problems?

252
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do

253
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is to forget about there being any single thing that is

254
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
the most important thing we need to do.

255
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.

256
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,

257
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,

258
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,

259
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.

260
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,

261
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.

262
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.

263
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
That means that those of us in this room who are less than

264
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,

265
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see

266
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.

267
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:

268
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses

269
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,

270
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
or else these conflicts are going to get settled

271
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,

272
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our

273
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another

274
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session

275
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should

276
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.

277
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
The big problems facing the world today are not at all

278
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid

279
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.

280
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems

281
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,

282
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's

283
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
entirely in our power to deal with these problems.

284
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you

285
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things

286
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,

287
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that

288
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that

289
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
we need to be doing. Thank you.

290
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

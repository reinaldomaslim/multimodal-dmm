1
0:00:12.896,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So I'm a neurosurgeon.

2
0:00:15.746,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And like most of my colleagues,

3
0:00:17.673,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.

4
0:00:22.549,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I realize how your life can change from one second to the other

5
0:00:27.378,000 --> 0:00:31,000
after a major stroke or after a car accident.

6
0:00:32.045,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons

7
0:00:35.807,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is to realize that unlike other organs of the body,

8
0:00:40.451,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the brain has very little ability for self-repair.

9
0:00:45.211,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And after a major injury of your central nervous system,

10
0:00:50.365,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the patients often remain with a severe handicap.

11
0:00:55.203,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And that's probably the reason why I've chosen

12
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to be a functional neurosurgeon.

13
0:01:01.144,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What is a functional neurosurgeon?

14
0:01:03.978,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function

15
0:01:08.362,000 --> 0:01:1,000
through different surgical strategies.

16
0:01:12.066,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones

17
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:16,000
called deep brain stimulation,

18
0:01:17.23,000 --> 0:01:21,000
where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain

19
0:01:21.386,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in order to modulate a circuit of neurons

20
0:01:24.986,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to improve a neurological function.

21
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's really an amazing technology

22
0:01:29.42,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in that it has improved the destiny of patients

23
0:01:32.811,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with Parkinson's disease,

24
0:01:34.657,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with severe tremor, with severe pain.

25
0:01:38.87,000 --> 0:01:43,000
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.

26
0:01:45.301,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons

27
0:01:47.632,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is to repair the brain.

28
0:01:51.222,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I think

29
0:01:52.643,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that we are approaching this dream.

30
0:01:54.502,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I would like to show you

31
0:01:57.161,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we are very close to this.

32
0:02:00.022,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And that with a little bit of help,

33
0:02:03.157,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the brain is able to help itself.

34
0:02:08.516,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So the story started 15 years ago.

35
0:02:11.156,000 --> 0:02:13,000
At that time, I was a chief resident

36
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
working days and nights in the emergency room.

37
0:02:16.619,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.

38
0:02:21.193,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,

39
0:02:25.678,000 --> 0:02:27,000
his brain is swelling

40
0:02:28.001,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.

41
0:02:31.716,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And in order to save his life,

42
0:02:33.969,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.

43
0:02:36.801,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And to do that,

44
0:02:37.976,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.

45
0:02:42.587,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,

46
0:02:46.959,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we decided with Jean-François Brunet,

47
0:02:49.472,000 --> 0:02:5,000
who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,

48
0:02:51.409,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to study them.

49
0:02:53.379,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What do I mean by that?

50
0:02:55.174,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.

51
0:03:00.484,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's not an easy task.

52
0:03:02.577,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Growing cells from a piece of tissue

53
0:03:04.966,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is a bit the same as growing very small children

54
0:03:08.449,000 --> 0:03:09,000
out from their family.

55
0:03:11.689,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So you need to find the right nutrients,

56
0:03:14.03,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the warmth, the humidity

57
0:03:15.823,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and all the nice environments to make them thrive.

58
0:03:19.083,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.

59
0:03:22.425,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And after many attempts,

60
0:03:24.959,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Jean-François did it.

61
0:03:27.372,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And that's what he saw under his microscope.

62
0:03:31.691,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And that was, for us, a major surprise.

63
0:03:34.412,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Why?

64
0:03:35.587,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,

65
0:03:40.453,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.

66
0:03:47.168,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And you may remember from biology class

67
0:03:50.446,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that stem cells are immature cells,

68
0:03:53.981,000 --> 0:03:56,000
able to turn into any type of cell of the body.

69
0:03:59.423,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare

70
0:04:04.075,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and they're located in deep and small niches

71
0:04:08.478,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in the depths of the brain.

72
0:04:10.519,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture

73
0:04:14.245,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from the superficial part of swollen brain we had

74
0:04:16.628,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in the operating theater.

75
0:04:18.269,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And there was another intriguing observation:

76
0:04:21.89,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Regular stem cells are very active cells --

77
0:04:26.14,000 --> 0:04:29,000
cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.

78
0:04:30.409,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And they never die, they're immortal cells.

79
0:04:33.407,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But these cells behave differently.

80
0:04:36.663,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They divide slowly,

81
0:04:38.87,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and after a few weeks of culture,

82
0:04:40.894,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they even died.

83
0:04:43.321,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So we were in front of a strange new cell population

84
0:04:46.997,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.

85
0:04:51.052,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.

86
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They come from these cells.

87
0:04:58.55,000 --> 0:05:02,000
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.

88
0:05:04.195,000 --> 0:05:06,000
All of you have them in your brain.

89
0:05:07.353,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.

90
0:05:11.857,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They have a very important role during the development stage.

91
0:05:15.953,000 --> 0:05:16,000
When you were fetuses,

92
0:05:18.457,000 --> 0:05:2,000
they helped your brain to fold itself.

93
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But why do they stay in your head?

94
0:05:25.371,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This, we don't know.

95
0:05:27.414,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We think that they may participate in brain repair

96
0:05:30.66,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because we find them in higher concentration

97
0:05:34.148,000 --> 0:05:35,000
close to brain lesions.

98
0:05:35.324,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But it's not so sure.

99
0:05:37.867,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But there is one clear thing --

100
0:05:40.236,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that from these cells,

101
0:05:41.857,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we got our stem cell culture.

102
0:05:45.363,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And we were in front of a potential new source of cells

103
0:05:48.021,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to repair the brain.

104
0:05:50.004,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And we had to prove this.

105
0:05:51.585,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So to prove it,

106
0:05:52.76,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we decided to design an experimental paradigm.

107
0:05:56.632,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain

108
0:05:59.879,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in a non-eloquent area of the brain,

109
0:06:02.602,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then to culture the cells

110
0:06:04.337,000 --> 0:06:06,000
exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.

111
0:06:07.148,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And then label them, to put color in them

112
0:06:10.067,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in order to be able to track them in the brain.

113
0:06:13.295,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And the last step was to re-implant them

114
0:06:15.448,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in the same individual.

115
0:06:17.255,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We call these

116
0:06:18.43,000 --> 0:06:2,000
autologous grafts -- autografts.

117
0:06:21.602,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So the first question we had,

118
0:06:24.069,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,

119
0:06:29.334,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells

120
0:06:32.216,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in a lesioned brain?"

121
0:06:33.463,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,

122
0:06:36.876,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we worked with monkeys.

123
0:06:39.414,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So in the first-case scenario,

124
0:06:41.878,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain

125
0:06:45.407,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,

126
0:06:50.466,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as if they were taken from the brain,

127
0:06:53.444,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they go back home,

128
0:06:54.979,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the space is already busy,

129
0:06:56.559,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they are not needed there, so they disappear.

130
0:06:59.78,000 --> 0:07:,000
In the second-case scenario,

131
0:07:01.782,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we performed the lesion,

132
0:07:03.037,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we re-implanted exactly the same cells,

133
0:07:06.201,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and in this case, the cells remained --

134
0:07:10.298,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they became mature neurons.

135
0:07:13.824,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.

136
0:07:17.635,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Those are the cells that were re-implanted.

137
0:07:20.839,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And the proof they carry,

138
0:07:22.81,000 --> 0:07:25,000
these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled

139
0:07:26.011,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in vitro, when they were in culture.

140
0:07:29.755,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But we could not stop here, of course.

141
0:07:32.521,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?

142
0:07:37.182,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.

143
0:07:42.688,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.

144
0:07:45.73,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They were very good at it.

145
0:07:47.896,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And when they had reached a plateau of performance,

146
0:07:51.392,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.

147
0:07:57.711,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So the monkeys were plegic,

148
0:07:59.592,000 --> 0:08:,000
they could not move their hand anymore.

149
0:08:02.165,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And exactly the same as humans would do,

150
0:08:05.743,000 --> 0:08:07,000
they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,

151
0:08:08.693,000 --> 0:08:1,000
exactly the same as after a stroke.

152
0:08:10.737,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Patients are completely plegic,

153
0:08:12.548,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,

154
0:08:17.68,000 --> 0:08:18,000
they recover to a certain extent,

155
0:08:19.344,000 --> 0:08:2,000
exactly the same for the monkey.

156
0:08:21.209,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau

157
0:08:24.677,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of spontaneous recovery,

158
0:08:27.129,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we implanted his own cells.

159
0:08:30.287,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.

160
0:08:37.426,000 --> 0:08:41,000
He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance

161
0:08:42.082,000 --> 0:08:43,000
before the lesion.

162
0:08:44.079,000 --> 0:08:46,000
He's not so accurate, not so quick.

163
0:08:47.376,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And look now when we re-implant the cells:

164
0:08:50.859,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.

165
0:08:57.255,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

166
0:09:04.77,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.

167
0:09:09.321,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.

168
0:09:13.575,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We know that we can cryopreserve them,

169
0:09:15.995,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we can use them later on.

170
0:09:18.214,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models,

171
0:09:22.128,000 --> 0:09:23,000
like Parkinson's disease, for example.

172
0:09:24.121,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.

173
0:09:28.469,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon

174
0:09:33.605,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.

175
0:09:38.623,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Thank you.

176
0:09:39.967,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:45.977,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,

178
0:09:49.303,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience,

179
0:09:53.078,000 --> 0:09:54,000
possibly even a majority,

180
0:09:54.308,000 --> 0:09:56,000
who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."

181
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I do, in any case.

182
0:09:59.364,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And of course the question is,

183
0:10:01.684,000 --> 0:10:03,000
what are the biggest obstacles

184
0:10:03.786,000 --> 0:10:05,000
before you can go into human clinical trials?

185
0:10:07.665,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)

186
0:10:13.195,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out

187
0:10:15.981,000 --> 0:10:18,000
about two kilograms of papers and forms

188
0:10:19.242,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to be able to go through these kind of trials.

189
0:10:22.314,000 --> 0:10:24,000
BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.

190
0:10:24.97,000 --> 0:10:26,000
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time

191
0:10:27.352,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?

192
0:10:31.407,000 --> 0:10:33,000
BG: If you project yourself --

193
0:10:33.697,000 --> 0:10:34,000
having done the research

194
0:10:34.936,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and having tried to get permission to start the trials,

195
0:10:38.905,000 --> 0:10:41,000
if you project yourself out in time,

196
0:10:42.736,000 --> 0:10:45,000
how many years before somebody gets into a hospital

197
0:10:46.458,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and this therapy is available?

198
0:10:49.555,000 --> 0:10:51,000
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.

199
0:10:51.714,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.

200
0:10:55.672,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?

201
0:10:58.799,000 --> 0:11:,000
And then, you have to perform this kind of study

202
0:11:01.637,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in a small group of patients.

203
0:11:04.461,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients,

204
0:11:07.41,000 --> 0:11:08,000
do the treatment

205
0:11:09.34,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.

206
0:11:13.093,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.

207
0:11:17.776,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You have to really prove first that it's useful

208
0:11:21.962,000 --> 0:11:23,000
before offering this treatment up for everybody.

209
0:11:24.867,000 --> 0:11:25,000
BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.

210
0:11:26.78,000 --> 0:11:28,000
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.

211
0:11:29.598,000 --> 0:11:3,000
BG: Thank you.

212
0:11:30.773,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Applause)

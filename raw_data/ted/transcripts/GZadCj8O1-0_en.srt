1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The recent debate over copyright laws

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
like SOPA in the United States

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the ACTA agreement in Europe

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
has been very emotional.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
could really bring a great deal to the debate.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'd therefore like to propose

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that we employ, we enlist,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the cutting edge field of copyright math

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
whenever we approach this subject.

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
For instance, just recently

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the Motion Picture Association revealed

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to copyright theft.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now rather than just argue about this number,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a copyright mathematician will analyze it

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and he'll soon discover that this money

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
could stretch from this auditorium

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all the way across Ocean Boulevard

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
to the Westin, and then to Mars ...

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
... if we use pennies.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now this is obviously a powerful,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
some might say dangerously powerful, insight.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But it's also a morally important one.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of some pirated movies that we're talking about,

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but this is actual economic losses.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is the equivalent

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to the entire American corn crop failing

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
along with all of our fruit crops,

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as well as wheat, tobacco,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
rice, sorghum --

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But identifying the actual losses to the economy

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is almost impossible to do

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
unless we use copyright math.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
since Napster first came on the scene.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But total movie revenues

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Other content markets like book publishing and radio

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
are also up.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So this small missing chunk here

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is puzzling.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Since the big content markets

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
have grown in line with historic norms,

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but copyright math tells us

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it must therefore be foregone growth

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in a market that has no historic norms --

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
one that didn't exist in the 90's.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What we're looking at here

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
50 billion dollars of it a year,

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that could stretch from here

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to Neanderthal times.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's true.

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I have Excel.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The movie folks also tell us

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that our economy loses

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
over 370,000 jobs to content theft,

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that the motion picture and video industries

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
were employing 270,000 people.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And so the job losses that came with the Internet

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and all that content theft,

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And some people think that string theory is tough.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's the precise amount of harm

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that comes to media companies

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
whenever a single copyrighted song or movie

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
gets pirated.

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and made this law.

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Some people think this number's a little bit large,

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
are merely surprised

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now when this law first passed,

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And it was a big Christmas hit.

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

101
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which is to say eight billion dollars-worth

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of stolen media.

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Or about 75,000 jobs.

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now you might find copyright math strange,

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but that's because it's a field

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that's best left to experts.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So that's it for now.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I hope you'll join me next time

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Thank you very much.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Thank you.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Now, if President Obama

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
then I would have a suggestion for him

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I think would vastly improve

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the mathematics education in this country.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And it would be easy to implement

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and inexpensive.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The mathematics curriculum that we have

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And everything we learn after that

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is building up towards one subject.

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I'm here to say

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
every high school graduate should know --

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
should be statistics:

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
probability and statistics.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's one of the great products of the human mind.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
they should definitely learn calculus

25
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
by the end of their freshman year of college.

26
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that very few people actually use calculus

28
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
On the other hand,

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and should, use on daily basis. Right?

32
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's understanding data.

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I think if our students, if our high school students --

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
if all of the American citizens --

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
knew about probability and statistics,

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)

38
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

40
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I mean, probability and statistics,

41
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

42
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Look, the world has changed

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
from analog to digital.

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from analog to digital,

47
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,

48
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --

49
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the mathematics of uncertainty,

50
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of randomness, of data --

51
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that being probability and statistics.

52
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In summary, instead of our students

53
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
learning about the techniques of calculus,

54
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I think it would be far more significant

55
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
if all of them knew what two standard deviations

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from the mean means. And I mean it.

57
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Thank you very much.

58
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

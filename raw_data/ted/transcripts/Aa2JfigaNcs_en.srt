1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I study how the brain processes

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
information. That is, how it takes

3
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
information in from the outside world, and

4
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
converts it into patterns of electrical activity,

5
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and then how it uses those patterns

6
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to allow you to do things --

7
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to see, hear, to reach for an object.

8
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I'm really a basic scientist, not

9
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a clinician, but in the last year and a half

10
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've started to switch over, to use what

11
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we've been learning about these patterns

12
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of activity to develop prosthetic devices,

13
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and what I wanted to do today is show you

14
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
an example of this.

15
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's really our first foray into this.

16
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's the development of a prosthetic device

17
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for treating blindness.

18
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So let me start in on that problem.

19
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There are 10 million people in the U.S.

20
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and many more worldwide who are blind

21
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or are facing blindness due to diseases

22
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
of the retina, diseases like

23
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
macular degeneration, and there's little

24
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that can be done for them.

25
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There are some drug treatments, but

26
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they're only effective on a small fraction

27
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the population. And so, for the vast

28
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
majority of patients, their best hope for

29
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.

30
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The problem is that current prosthetics

31
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
don't work very well. They're still very

32
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
limited in the vision that they can provide.

33
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And so, you know, for example, with these

34
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
devices, patients can see simple things

35
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like bright lights and high contrast edges,

36
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
not very much more, so nothing close

37
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to normal vision has been possible.

38
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So what I'm going to tell you about today

39
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is a device that we've been working on

40
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that I think has the potential to make

41
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a difference, to be much more effective,

42
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and what I wanted to do is show you

43
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
how it works. Okay, so let me back up a

44
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
little bit and show you how a normal retina

45
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
works first so you can see the problem

46
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that we were trying to solve.

47
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here you have a retina.

48
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.

49
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So when you look at something, like this image

50
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of this baby's face, it goes into your eye

51
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it lands on your retina, on the front-end

52
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
cells here, the photoreceptors.

53
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry,

54
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the middle part, goes to work on it,

55
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and what it does is it performs operations

56
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
on it, it extracts information from it, and it

57
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
converts that information into a code.

58
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And the code is in the form of these patterns

59
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of electrical pulses that get sent

60
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
up to the brain, and so the key thing is

61
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that the image ultimately gets converted

62
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
into a code. And when I say code,

63
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I do literally mean code.

64
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,"

65
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so when the brain gets this pattern

66
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of pulses, it knows that what was out there

67
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
was a baby's face, and if it

68
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
got a different pattern it would know

69
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that what was out there was, say, a dog,

70
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or another pattern would be a house.

71
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Anyway, you get the idea.

72
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,

73
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
meaning that it's changing all the time,

74
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so the patterns of pulses are changing

75
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
all the time because the world you're

76
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
looking at is changing all the time too.

77
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, you know, it's sort of a complicated

78
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
thing. You have these patterns of pulses

79
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
coming out of your eye every millisecond

80
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.

81
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So what happens when a person

82
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
gets a retinal degenerative disease like

83
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
macular degeneration? What happens is

84
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is that, the front-end cells die,

85
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the photoreceptors die, and over time,

86
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
all the cells and the circuits that are

87
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
connected to them, they die too.

88
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Until the only things that you have left

89
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
are these cells here, the output cells,

90
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the ones that send the signals to the brain,

91
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but because of all that degeneration

92
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they aren't sending any signals anymore.

93
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They aren't getting any input, so

94
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the person's brain no longer gets

95
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
any visual information --

96
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that is, he or she is blind.

97
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So, a solution to the problem, then,

98
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
would be to build a device that could mimic

99
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the actions of that front-end circuitry

100
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and send signals to the retina's output cells,

101
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and they can go back to doing their

102
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
normal job of sending signals to the brain.

103
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So this is what we've been working on,

104
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and this is what our prosthetic does.

105
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So it consists of two parts, what we call

106
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
an encoder and a transducer.

107
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And so the encoder does just

108
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what I was saying: it mimics the actions

109
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images

110
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
in and converts them into the retina's code.

111
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And then the transducer then makes the

112
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
output cells send the code on up

113
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to the brain, and the result is

114
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a retinal prosthetic that can produce

115
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
normal retinal output.

116
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So a completely blind retina,

117
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
even one with no front-end circuitry at all,

118
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
no photoreceptors,

119
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
can now send out normal signals,

120
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
signals that the brain can understand.

121
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So no other device has been able

122
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to do this.

123
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Okay, so I just want to take

124
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a sentence or two to say something about

125
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the encoder and what it's doing, because

126
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's really the key part and it's

127
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
sort of interesting and kind of cool.

128
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but

129
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you know what I mean.

130
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So what it's doing is, it's replacing

131
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the retinal circuitry, really the guts of

132
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,

133
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a set of equations that we can implement

134
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on a chip. So it's just math.

135
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In other words, we're not literally replacing

136
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the components of the retina.

137
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's not like we're making a little mini-device

138
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for each of the different cell types.

139
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We've just abstracted what the

140
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
retina's doing with a set of equations.

141
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And so, in a way, the equations are serving

142
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as sort of a codebook. An image comes in,

143
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
goes through the set of equations,

144
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and out comes streams of electrical pulses,

145
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
just like a normal retina would produce.

146
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now let me put my money

147
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
where my mouth is and show you that

148
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we can actually produce normal output,

149
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and what the implications of this are.

150
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Here are three sets of

151
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
firing patterns. The top one is from

152
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a normal animal, the middle one is from

153
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a blind animal that's been treated with

154
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
this encoder-transducer device, and the

155
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
bottom one is from a blind animal treated

156
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
with a standard prosthetic.

157
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art

158
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
device that's out there right now, which is

159
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
basically made up of light detectors,

160
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but no encoder. So what we did was we

161
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
presented movies of everyday things --

162
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
people, babies, park benches,

163
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you know, regular things happening -- and

164
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we recorded the responses from the retinas

165
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of these three groups of animals.

166
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now just to orient you, each box is showing

167
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
the firing patterns of several cells,

168
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and just as in the previous slides,

169
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
each row is a different cell,

170
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller

171
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and thinner so I could show you

172
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
a long stretch of data.

173
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So as you can see, the firing patterns

174
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
from the blind animal treated with

175
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the encoder-transducer really do very

176
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
closely match the normal firing patterns --

177
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good --

178
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the blind animal treated with

179
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the standard prosthetic,

180
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the responses really don't.

181
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And so with the standard method,

182
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the cells do fire, they just don't fire

183
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in the normal firing patterns because

184
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they don't have the right code.

185
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
How important is this?

186
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What's the potential impact

187
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
on a patient's ability to see?

188
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So I'm just going to show you one

189
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
bottom-line experiment that answers this,

190
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and of course I've got a lot of other data,

191
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so if you're interested I'm happy

192
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to show more. So the experiment

193
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is called a reconstruction experiment.

194
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So what we did is we took a moment

195
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
in time from these recordings and asked,

196
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what was the retina seeing at that moment?

197
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Can we reconstruct what the retina

198
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was seeing from the responses

199
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
from the firing patterns?

200
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So, when we did this for responses

201
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
from the standard method and from

202
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
our encoder and transducer.

203
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So let me show you, and I'm going to

204
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
start with the standard method first.

205
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So you can see that it's pretty limited,

206
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and because the firing patterns aren't

207
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in the right code, they're very limited in

208
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what they can tell you about

209
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
what's out there. So you can see that

210
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
there's something there, but it's not so clear

211
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what that something is, and this just sort of

212
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
circles back to what I was saying in the

213
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
beginning, that with the standard method,

214
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
patients can see high-contrast edges, they

215
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
can see light, but it doesn't easily go

216
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
further than that. So what was

217
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the image? It was a baby's face.

218
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So what about with our approach,

219
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
adding the code? And you can see

220
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that it's much better. Not only can you

221
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
tell that it's a baby's face, but you can

222
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
tell that it's this baby's face, which is a

223
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
really challenging task.

224
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So on the left is the encoder

225
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
alone, and on the right is from an actual

226
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.

227
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But the key one really is the encoder alone,

228
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because we can team up the encoder with

229
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the different transducer.

230
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is just actually the first one that we tried.

231
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I just wanted to say something about the standard method.

232
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
When this first came out, it was just a really

233
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
exciting thing, the idea that you

234
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
even make a blind retina respond at all.

235
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But there was this limiting factor,

236
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the issue of the code, and how to make

237
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the cells respond better,

238
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
produce normal responses,

239
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and so this was our contribution.

240
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now I just want to wrap up,

241
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and as I was mentioning earlier

242
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of course I have a lot of other data

243
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
if you're interested, but I just wanted to give

244
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
this sort of basic idea

245
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of being able to communicate

246
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
with the brain in its language, and

247
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the potential power of being able to do that.

248
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So it's different from the motor prosthetics

249
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where you're communicating from the brain

250
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to a device. Here we have to communicate

251
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
from the outside world

252
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
into the brain and be understood,

253
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and be understood by the brain.

254
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And then the last thing I wanted

255
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to say, really, is to emphasize

256
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that the idea generalizes.

257
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So the same strategy that we used

258
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to find the code for the retina we can also

259
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
use to find the code for other areas,

260
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
for example, the auditory system and

261
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the motor system, so for treating deafness

262
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and for motor disorders.

263
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So just the same way that we were able to

264
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
jump over the damaged

265
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's

266
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
output cells, we can jump over the

267
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
damaged circuitry in the cochlea

268
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to get the auditory nerve,

269
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or jump over damaged areas in the cortex,

270
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap

271
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
produced by a stroke.

272
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I just want to end with a simple

273
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
message that understanding the code

274
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is really, really important, and if we

275
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
can understand the code,

276
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the language of the brain, things become

277
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
possible that didn't seem obviously

278
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
possible before. Thank you.

279
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

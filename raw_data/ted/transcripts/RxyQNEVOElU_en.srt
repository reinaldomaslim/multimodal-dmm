1
0:00:12.93,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every day we face issues like climate change

2
0:00:16.058,000 --> 0:00:17,000
or the safety of vaccines

3
0:00:17.488,000 --> 0:00:2,000
where we have to answer questions whose answers

4
0:00:20.528,000 --> 0:00:23,000
rely heavily on scientific information.

5
0:00:23.989,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Scientists tell us that the world is warming.

6
0:00:26.87,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe.

7
0:00:29.411,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But how do we know if they are right?

8
0:00:31.465,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Why should be believe the science?

9
0:00:33.429,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The fact is, many of us actually don't believe the science.

10
0:00:36.898,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Public opinion polls consistently show

11
0:00:39.074,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that significant proportions of the American people

12
0:00:42.084,000 --> 0:00:45,000
don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities,

13
0:00:45.625,000 --> 0:00:47,000
don't think that there is evolution by natural selection,

14
0:00:48.564,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines.

15
0:00:52.465,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So why should we believe the science?

16
0:00:56.096,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Well, scientists don't like talking about science as a matter of belief.

17
0:00:59.707,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In fact, they would contrast science with faith,

18
0:01:02.294,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and they would say belief is the domain of faith.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science.

20
0:01:09.038,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Indeed they would say religion is based on faith

21
0:01:12.19,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.

22
0:01:15.884,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician

23
0:01:18.56,000 --> 0:01:2,000
who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of

24
0:01:21.37,000 --> 0:01:22,000
whether or not he should believe in God,

25
0:01:23.242,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and his wager went like this:

26
0:01:25.846,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well, if God doesn't exist

27
0:01:28.395,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but I decide to believe in him

28
0:01:30.42,000 --> 0:01:31,000
nothing much is really lost.

29
0:01:32.398,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Maybe a few hours on Sunday.

30
0:01:34.011,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:35.004,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But if he does exist and I don't believe in him,

32
0:01:38.385,000 --> 0:01:4,000
then I'm in deep trouble.

33
0:01:40.402,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.

34
0:01:43.438,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Or as one of my college professors said,

35
0:01:45.61,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"He clutched for the handrail of faith."

36
0:01:47.836,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He made that leap of faith

37
0:01:49.772,000 --> 0:01:53,000
leaving science and rationalism behind.

38
0:01:54.296,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now the fact is though, for most of us,

39
0:01:56.992,000 --> 0:01:59,000
most scientific claims are a leap of faith.

40
0:02:00.126,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases.

41
0:02:04.511,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well

42
0:02:07.351,000 --> 0:02:09,000
outside of their own specialties.

43
0:02:09.681,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you

44
0:02:12.201,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whether a vaccine is safe.

45
0:02:13.951,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.

46
0:02:16.951,000 --> 0:02:18,000
A physicist cannot tell you,

47
0:02:19.21,000 --> 0:02:2,000
despite the claims of some of them,

48
0:02:20.653,000 --> 0:02:23,000
whether or not tobacco causes cancer.

49
0:02:24.007,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So, if even scientists themselves

50
0:02:26.457,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have to make a leap of faith

51
0:02:27.733,000 --> 0:02:28,000
outside their own fields,

52
0:02:29.655,000 --> 0:02:32,000
then why do they accept the claims of other scientists?

53
0:02:33.583,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Why do they believe each other's claims?

54
0:02:35.881,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And should we believe those claims?

55
0:02:39.171,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,

56
0:02:41.947,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but not for the reason that most of us think.

57
0:02:44.83,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Most of us were taught in school that the reason we should

58
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
believe in science is because of the scientific method.

59
0:02:50.572,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We were taught that scientists follow a method

60
0:02:53.488,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and that this method guarantees

61
0:02:55.844,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the truth of their claims.

62
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:03:,000
The method that most of us were taught in school,

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we can call it the textbook method,

64
0:03:02.836,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is the hypothetical deductive method.

65
0:03:05.62,000 --> 0:03:08,000
According to the standard model, the textbook model,

66
0:03:08.714,000 --> 0:03:1,000
scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce

67
0:03:11.671,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the consequences of those hypotheses,

68
0:03:14.131,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then they go out into the world and they say,

69
0:03:15.841,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Okay, well are those consequences true?"

70
0:03:18.215,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Can we observe them taking place in the natural world?

71
0:03:21.548,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And if they are true, then the scientists say,

72
0:03:24.148,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct."

73
0:03:27.004,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So there are many famous examples in the history

74
0:03:29.183,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of science of scientists doing exactly this.

75
0:03:32.062,000 --> 0:03:34,000
One of the most famous examples

76
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
comes from the work of Albert Einstein.

77
0:03:36.333,000 --> 0:03:38,000
When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity,

78
0:03:38.855,000 --> 0:03:4,000
one of the consequences of his theory

79
0:03:41.171,000 --> 0:03:43,000
was that space-time wasn't just an empty void

80
0:03:44.01,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but that it actually had a fabric.

81
0:03:45.919,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that that fabric was bent

82
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the presence of massive objects like the sun.

83
0:03:50.9,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So if this theory were true then it meant that light

84
0:03:53.649,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as it passed the sun

85
0:03:55.177,000 --> 0:03:57,000
should actually be bent around it.

86
0:03:57.345,000 --> 0:03:59,000
That was a pretty startling prediction

87
0:03:59.745,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it took a few years before scientists

88
0:04:01.733,000 --> 0:04:02,000
were able to test it

89
0:04:03.011,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but they did test it in 1919,

90
0:04:05.521,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and lo and behold it turned out to be true.

91
0:04:07.971,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun.

92
0:04:11.129,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This was a huge confirmation of the theory.

93
0:04:13.623,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It was considered proof of the truth

94
0:04:15.428,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of this radical new idea,

95
0:04:16.74,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it was written up in many newspapers

96
0:04:18.592,000 --> 0:04:2,000
around the globe.

97
0:04:21.13,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, sometimes this theory or this model

98
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is referred to as the deductive-nomological model,

99
0:04:26.914,000 --> 0:04:29,000
mainly because academics like to make things complicated.

100
0:04:30.298,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.

101
0:04:35.559,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So nomological means having to do with laws.

102
0:04:38.061,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:

103
0:04:41.485,000 --> 0:04:43,000
ideally, it is a law of nature.

104
0:04:43.811,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Why does it matter that it is a law of nature?

105
0:04:46.098,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Because if it is a law, it can't be broken.

106
0:04:48.826,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If it's a law then it will always be true

107
0:04:50.934,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in all times and all places

108
0:04:52.178,000 --> 0:04:54,000
no matter what the circumstances are.

109
0:04:54.384,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law:

110
0:04:57.613,000 --> 0:05:,000
Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2,

111
0:05:01.368,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which tells us what the relationship is

112
0:05:03.168,000 --> 0:05:05,000
between energy and mass.

113
0:05:05.361,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And that relationship is true no matter what.

114
0:05:09.361,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, it turns out, though, that there are several problems with this model.

115
0:05:13.01,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The main problem is that it's wrong.

116
0:05:16.645,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's just not true. (Laughter)

117
0:05:20.147,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong.

118
0:05:22.87,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So the first reason is a logical reason.

119
0:05:25.549,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

120
0:05:29.065,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So that's another fancy, academic way of saying

121
0:05:31.891,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that false theories can make true predictions.

122
0:05:34.561,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So just because the prediction comes true

123
0:05:36.555,000 --> 0:05:39,000
doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct.

124
0:05:39.777,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I have a good example of that too, again from the history of science.

125
0:05:43.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe

126
0:05:46.403,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with the Earth at the center of the universe

127
0:05:48.265,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the sun and the planets going around it.

128
0:05:50.86,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The Ptolemaic model was believed

129
0:05:52.89,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by many very smart people for many centuries.

130
0:05:56.143,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, why?

131
0:05:57.879,000 --> 0:06:,000
Well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true.

132
0:06:01.316,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers

133
0:06:03.332,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet,

134
0:06:06.082,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in fact more accurate predictions at first

135
0:06:08.601,000 --> 0:06:12,000
than the Copernican theory which we now would say is true.

136
0:06:12.925,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So that's one problem with the textbook model.

137
0:06:15.907,000 --> 0:06:17,000
A second problem is a practical problem,

138
0:06:18.303,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.

139
0:06:21.538,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions

140
0:06:24.367,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that scientists are making

141
0:06:26.146,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that they may or may not even be aware that they're making.

142
0:06:29.189,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So an important example of this

143
0:06:31.85,000 --> 0:06:33,000
comes from the Copernican model,

144
0:06:33.945,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.

145
0:06:37.137,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So when Nicolaus Copernicus said,

146
0:06:39.177,000 --> 0:06:41,000
actually the Earth is not the center of the universe,

147
0:06:41.827,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the sun is the center of the solar system,

148
0:06:43.745,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the Earth moves around the sun.

149
0:06:45.127,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true

150
0:06:48.855,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we ought to be able to detect the motion

151
0:06:50.619,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of the Earth around the sun.

152
0:06:52.577,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And so this slide here illustrates a concept

153
0:06:54.633,000 --> 0:06:55,000
known as stellar parallax.

154
0:06:56.441,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving

155
0:07:00.263,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius --

156
0:07:03.463,000 --> 0:07:05,000
well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars,

157
0:07:05.877,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but imagine you're out in the country, imagine you chose that rural life —

158
0:07:09.608,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we look at a star in December, we see that star

159
0:07:12.475,000 --> 0:07:14,000
against the backdrop of distant stars.

160
0:07:15.24,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If we now make the same observation six months later

161
0:07:18.194,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when the Earth has moved to this position in June,

162
0:07:22.006,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop.

163
0:07:26.105,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That difference, that angular difference, is the stellar parallax.

164
0:07:30.287,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.

165
0:07:33.15,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax

166
0:07:35.711,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and they found nothing, nothing at all.

167
0:07:40.693,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And many people argued that this proved that the Copernican model was false.

168
0:07:44.559,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So what happened?

169
0:07:46.047,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Well, in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making

170
0:07:48.73,000 --> 0:07:5,000
two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which

171
0:07:51.277,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we would now say were incorrect.

172
0:07:53.94,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The first was an assumption about the size of the Earth's orbit.

173
0:07:57.575,000 --> 0:08:,000
Astronomers were assuming that the Earth's orbit was large

174
0:08:00.611,000 --> 0:08:02,000
relative to the distance to the stars.

175
0:08:02.949,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Today we would draw the picture more like this,

176
0:08:05.413,000 --> 0:08:06,000
this comes from NASA,

177
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.

178
0:08:09.183,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In fact, it's actually much smaller even than shown here.

179
0:08:12.174,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The stellar parallax therefore,

180
0:08:13.713,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is very small and actually very hard to detect.

181
0:08:17.297,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And that leads to the second reason

182
0:08:19.271,000 --> 0:08:2,000
why the prediction didn't work,

183
0:08:21.13,000 --> 0:08:22,000
because scientists were also assuming

184
0:08:23.045,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough

185
0:08:26.055,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to detect the parallax.

186
0:08:27.955,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And that turned out not to be true.

187
0:08:29.972,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It wasn't until the 19th century

188
0:08:32.506,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that scientists were able to detect

189
0:08:34.19,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the stellar parallax.

190
0:08:35.726,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So, there's a third problem as well.

191
0:08:38.372,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The third problem is simply a factual problem,

192
0:08:41.15,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.

193
0:08:43.966,000 --> 0:08:45,000
A lot of science isn't deductive at all,

194
0:08:46.239,000 --> 0:08:47,000
it's actually inductive.

195
0:08:48.007,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily

196
0:08:50.523,000 --> 0:08:52,000
start with theories and hypotheses,

197
0:08:52.754,000 --> 0:08:53,000
often they just start with observations

198
0:08:54.623,000 --> 0:08:56,000
of stuff going on in the world.

199
0:08:57.032,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the most famous example of that is one of the most

200
0:08:59.602,000 --> 0:09:02,000
famous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.

201
0:09:02.667,000 --> 0:09:05,000
When Darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the Beagle,

202
0:09:05.829,000 --> 0:09:08,000
he didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.

203
0:09:09.441,000 --> 0:09:12,000
He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist

204
0:09:12.507,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and he started to collect data.

205
0:09:14.519,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Mainly he knew that he hated medicine

206
0:09:17.249,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because the sight of blood made him sick so

207
0:09:19.067,000 --> 0:09:21,000
he had to have an alternative career path.

208
0:09:21.335,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So he started collecting data.

209
0:09:23.469,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And he collected many things, including his famous finches.

210
0:09:26.635,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When he collected these finches, he threw them in a bag

211
0:09:28.845,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and he had no idea what they meant.

212
0:09:31.185,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Many years later back in London,

213
0:09:33.472,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Darwin looked at his data again and began

214
0:09:35.705,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to develop an explanation,

215
0:09:38.153,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and that explanation was the theory of natural selection.

216
0:09:41.451,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Besides inductive science,

217
0:09:43.51,000 --> 0:09:45,000
scientists also often participate in modeling.

218
0:09:46.446,000 --> 0:09:48,000
One of the things scientists want to do in life

219
0:09:48.782,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is to explain the causes of things.

220
0:09:51.05,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And how do we do that?

221
0:09:52.568,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Well, one way you can do it is to build a model

222
0:09:54.82,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that tests an idea.

223
0:09:56.562,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So this is a picture of Henry Cadell,

224
0:09:58.493,000 --> 0:10:,000
who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.

225
0:10:01.359,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing

226
0:10:02.792,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.

227
0:10:05.18,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

228
0:10:07.334,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And Cadell wanted to answer the question,

229
0:10:08.9,000 --> 0:10:09,000
how are mountains formed?

230
0:10:10.668,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And one of the things he had observed

231
0:10:12.184,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians,

232
0:10:14.758,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you often find that the rocks in them

233
0:10:16.391,000 --> 0:10:17,000
are folded,

234
0:10:17.86,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and they're folded in a particular way,

235
0:10:19.506,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which suggested to him

236
0:10:20.95,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that they were actually being compressed from the side.

237
0:10:23.899,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And this idea would later play a major role

238
0:10:25.987,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in discussions of continental drift.

239
0:10:28.41,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So he built this model, this crazy contraption

240
0:10:30.916,000 --> 0:10:32,000
with levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,

241
0:10:33.068,000 --> 0:10:35,000
buckets, a big sledgehammer.

242
0:10:35.51,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.

243
0:10:37.408,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Maybe it's going to rain.

244
0:10:38.985,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And he created this physical model in order

245
0:10:42.07,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create

246
0:10:46.035,000 --> 0:10:48,000
patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,

247
0:10:48.709,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that looked a lot like mountains

248
0:10:50.935,000 --> 0:10:51,000
if you compressed them from the side.

249
0:10:52.777,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So it was an argument about the cause of mountains.

250
0:10:56.405,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,

251
0:10:59.453,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so they don't build physical models so much

252
0:11:01.88,000 --> 0:11:03,000
as to make computer simulations.

253
0:11:04.241,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But a computer simulation is a kind of a model.

254
0:11:07.08,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's a model that's made with mathematics,

255
0:11:08.943,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and like the physical models of the 19th century,

256
0:11:12.176,000 --> 0:11:15,000
it's very important for thinking about causes.

257
0:11:15.954,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So one of the big questions to do with climate change,

258
0:11:18.569,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we have tremendous amounts of evidence

259
0:11:20.372,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that the Earth is warming up.

260
0:11:22.252,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This slide here, the black line shows

261
0:11:24.716,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the measurements that scientists have taken

262
0:11:26.836,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for the last 150 years

263
0:11:28.799,000 --> 0:11:29,000
showing that the Earth's temperature

264
0:11:30.209,000 --> 0:11:31,000
has steadily increased,

265
0:11:31.843,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and you can see in particular that in the last 50 years

266
0:11:34.689,000 --> 0:11:35,000
there's been this dramatic increase

267
0:11:36.453,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of nearly one degree centigrade,

268
0:11:38.793,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or almost two degrees Fahrenheit.

269
0:11:41.168,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So what, though, is driving that change?

270
0:11:43.605,000 --> 0:11:45,000
How can we know what's causing

271
0:11:45.94,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the observed warming?

272
0:11:47.456,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Well, scientists can model it

273
0:11:49.17,000 --> 0:11:51,000
using a computer simulation.

274
0:11:51.538,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation

275
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that has looked at all the different factors

276
0:11:56.451,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that we know can influence the Earth's climate,

277
0:11:59.056,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so sulfate particles from air pollution,

278
0:12:01.808,000 --> 0:12:03,000
volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,

279
0:12:04.778,000 --> 0:12:06,000
changes in solar radiation,

280
0:12:07.012,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and, of course, greenhouse gases.

281
0:12:09.39,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And they asked the question,

282
0:12:11.208,000 --> 0:12:14,000
what set of variables put into a model

283
0:12:14.904,000 --> 0:12:16,000
will reproduce what we actually see in real life?

284
0:12:17.88,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So here is the real life in black.

285
0:12:19.9,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Here's the model in this light gray,

286
0:12:22.18,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and the answer is

287
0:12:23.74,000 --> 0:12:27,000
a model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,

288
0:12:28.127,000 --> 0:12:3,000
all of the above.

289
0:12:30.268,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The only way you can reproduce

290
0:12:31.774,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the observed temperature measurements

291
0:12:33.602,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is with all of these things put together,

292
0:12:35.58,000 --> 0:12:37,000
including greenhouse gases,

293
0:12:37.719,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and in particular you can see that the increase

294
0:12:40.27,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in greenhouse gases tracks

295
0:12:42.154,000 --> 0:12:44,000
this very dramatic increase in temperature

296
0:12:44.36,000 --> 0:12:45,000
over the last 50 years.

297
0:12:45.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And so this is why climate scientists say

298
0:12:48.274,000 --> 0:12:51,000
it's not just that we know that climate change is happening,

299
0:12:51.382,000 --> 0:12:53,000
we know that greenhouse gases are a major part

300
0:12:54.15,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of the reason why.

301
0:12:56.88,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So now because there all these different things

302
0:12:59.268,000 --> 0:13:,000
that scientists do,

303
0:13:00.757,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,

304
0:13:04.243,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"The only principle in science

305
0:13:05.869,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes."

306
0:13:09.848,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now this quotation has often been taken out of context,

307
0:13:12.464,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because Feyerabend was not actually saying

308
0:13:14.582,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that in science anything goes.

309
0:13:16.532,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What he was saying was,

310
0:13:17.876,000 --> 0:13:19,000
actually the full quotation is,

311
0:13:19.9,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"If you press me to say

312
0:13:21.99,000 --> 0:13:22,000
what is the method of science,

313
0:13:23.636,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I would have to say: anything goes."

314
0:13:27.265,000 --> 0:13:28,000
What he was trying to say

315
0:13:28.343,000 --> 0:13:3,000
is that scientists do a lot of different things.

316
0:13:30.91,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Scientists are creative.

317
0:13:33.218,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But then this pushes the question back:

318
0:13:35.328,000 --> 0:13:38,000
If scientists don't use a single method,

319
0:13:38.799,000 --> 0:13:39,000
then how do they decide

320
0:13:40.698,000 --> 0:13:41,000
what's right and what's wrong?

321
0:13:42.156,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And who judges?

322
0:13:44.05,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And the answer is, scientists judge,

323
0:13:46.13,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and they judge by judging evidence.

324
0:13:49.013,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Scientists collect evidence in many different ways,

325
0:13:52.422,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but however they collect it,

326
0:13:54.044,000 --> 0:13:56,000
they have to subject it to scrutiny.

327
0:13:56.621,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And this led the sociologist Robert Merton

328
0:13:59.181,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to focus on this question of how scientists

329
0:14:01.361,000 --> 0:14:02,000
scrutinize data and evidence,

330
0:14:03.04,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and he said they do it in a way he called

331
0:14:05.848,000 --> 0:14:06,000
"organized skepticism."

332
0:14:07.767,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And by that he meant it's organized

333
0:14:09.651,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because they do it collectively,

334
0:14:11.129,000 --> 0:14:12,000
they do it as a group,

335
0:14:12.758,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and skepticism, because they do it from a position

336
0:14:15.574,000 --> 0:14:16,000
of distrust.

337
0:14:17.028,000 --> 0:14:18,000
That is to say, the burden of proof

338
0:14:18.99,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is on the person with a novel claim.

339
0:14:21.471,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And in this sense, science is intrinsically conservative.

340
0:14:24.614,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community

341
0:14:27.186,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to say, "Yes, we know something, this is true."

342
0:14:30.897,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So despite the popularity of the concept

343
0:14:33.393,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of paradigm shifts,

344
0:14:34.99,000 --> 0:14:35,000
what we find is that actually,

345
0:14:36.274,000 --> 0:14:38,000
really major changes in scientific thinking

346
0:14:39.059,000 --> 0:14:42,000
are relatively rare in the history of science.

347
0:14:42.779,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So finally that brings us to one more idea:

348
0:14:46.342,000 --> 0:14:49,000
If scientists judge evidence collectively,

349
0:14:50.05,000 --> 0:14:52,000
this has led historians to focus on the question

350
0:14:52.612,000 --> 0:14:53,000
of consensus,

351
0:14:54.031,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and to say that at the end of the day,

352
0:14:55.926,000 --> 0:14:56,000
what science is,

353
0:14:57.86,000 --> 0:14:58,000
what scientific knowledge is,

354
0:14:59.53,000 --> 0:15:02,000
is the consensus of the scientific experts

355
0:15:02.909,000 --> 0:15:04,000
who through this process of organized scrutiny,

356
0:15:05.063,000 --> 0:15:07,000
collective scrutiny,

357
0:15:07.368,000 --> 0:15:08,000
have judged the evidence

358
0:15:08.61,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and come to a conclusion about it,

359
0:15:11.407,000 --> 0:15:13,000
either yea or nay.

360
0:15:13.884,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So we can think of scientific knowledge

361
0:15:15.608,000 --> 0:15:17,000
as a consensus of experts.

362
0:15:17.66,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We can also think of science as being

363
0:15:19.432,000 --> 0:15:2,000
a kind of a jury,

364
0:15:21.01,000 --> 0:15:23,000
except it's a very special kind of jury.

365
0:15:23.524,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's not a jury of your peers,

366
0:15:25.628,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it's a jury of geeks.

367
0:15:27.524,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,

368
0:15:31.158,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and unlike a conventional jury,

369
0:15:33.6,000 --> 0:15:34,000
which has only two choices,

370
0:15:35.29,000 --> 0:15:37,000
guilty or not guilty,

371
0:15:37.975,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the scientific jury actually has a number of choices.

372
0:15:41.376,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Scientists can say yes, something's true.

373
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Scientists can say no, it's false.

374
0:15:46.74,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Or, they can say, well it might be true

375
0:15:49.28,000 --> 0:15:52,000
but we need to work more and collect more evidence.

376
0:15:52.324,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Or, they can say it might be true,

377
0:15:53.94,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but we don't know how to answer the question

378
0:15:55.64,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and we're going to put it aside

379
0:15:56.95,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and maybe we'll come back to it later.

380
0:15:59.873,000 --> 0:16:03,000
That's what scientists call "intractable."

381
0:16:03.875,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But this leads us to one final problem:

382
0:16:06.481,000 --> 0:16:08,000
If science is what scientists say it is,

383
0:16:09.419,000 --> 0:16:11,000
then isn't that just an appeal to authority?

384
0:16:11.96,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And weren't we all taught in school

385
0:16:13.022,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?

386
0:16:16.249,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Well, here's the paradox of modern science,

387
0:16:19.281,000 --> 0:16:21,000
the paradox of the conclusion I think historians

388
0:16:21.553,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and philosophers and sociologists have come to,

389
0:16:24.154,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that actually science is the appeal to authority,

390
0:16:27.655,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but it's not the authority of the individual,

391
0:16:31.431,000 --> 0:16:33,000
no matter how smart that individual is,

392
0:16:33.83,000 --> 0:16:36,000
like Plato or Socrates or Einstein.

393
0:16:37.695,000 --> 0:16:4,000
It's the authority of the collective community.

394
0:16:40.809,000 --> 0:16:42,000
You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,

395
0:16:43.795,000 --> 0:16:47,000
but a very special kind of crowd.

396
0:16:47.921,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Science does appeal to authority,

397
0:16:49.811,000 --> 0:16:51,000
but it's not based on any individual,

398
0:16:51.861,000 --> 0:16:53,000
no matter how smart that individual may be.

399
0:16:54.447,000 --> 0:16:55,000
It's based on the collective wisdom,

400
0:16:56.198,000 --> 0:16:58,000
the collective knowledge, the collective work,

401
0:16:58.84,000 --> 0:16:59,000
of all of the scientists who have worked

402
0:17:00.738,000 --> 0:17:02,000
on a particular problem.

403
0:17:03.455,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,

404
0:17:06.251,000 --> 0:17:08,000
this "show me" culture,

405
0:17:08.451,000 --> 0:17:09,000
illustrated by this nice woman here

406
0:17:10.401,000 --> 0:17:13,000
showing her colleagues her evidence.

407
0:17:13.483,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Of course, these people don't really look like scientists,

408
0:17:15.34,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because they're much too happy.

409
0:17:17.326,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Laughter)

410
0:17:21.338,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Okay, so that brings me to my final point.

411
0:17:25.66,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Most of us get up in the morning.

412
0:17:28.308,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Most of us trust our cars.

413
0:17:29.718,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,

414
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
this is a bad analogy,

415
0:17:32.558,000 --> 0:17:34,000
but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan

416
0:17:35.382,000 --> 0:17:36,000
get up in the morning and get in their cars

417
0:17:37.12,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and turn on that ignition, and their cars work,

418
0:17:39.649,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and they work incredibly well.

419
0:17:41.65,000 --> 0:17:43,000
The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down.

420
0:17:44.365,000 --> 0:17:46,000
So why is that? Why do cars work so well?

421
0:17:47.148,000 --> 0:17:49,000
It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford

422
0:17:49.652,000 --> 0:17:52,000
or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.

423
0:17:52.743,000 --> 0:17:54,000
It's because the modern automobile

424
0:17:54.885,000 --> 0:17:59,000
is the product of more than 100 years of work

425
0:17:59.919,000 --> 0:18:,000
by hundreds and thousands

426
0:18:01.509,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and tens of thousands of people.

427
0:18:02.845,000 --> 0:18:04,000
The modern automobile is the product

428
0:18:04.956,000 --> 0:18:06,000
of the collected work and wisdom and experience

429
0:18:07.745,000 --> 0:18:09,000
of every man and woman who has ever worked

430
0:18:10.092,000 --> 0:18:11,000
on a car,

431
0:18:11.7,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and the reliability of the technology is the result

432
0:18:14.615,000 --> 0:18:16,000
of that accumulated effort.

433
0:18:17.298,000 --> 0:18:19,000
We benefit not just from the genius of Benz

434
0:18:20.155,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and Ford and Musk

435
0:18:21.221,000 --> 0:18:23,000
but from the collective intelligence and hard work

436
0:18:23.989,000 --> 0:18:25,000
of all of the people who have worked

437
0:18:26.24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
on the modern car.

438
0:18:27.91,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And the same is true of science,

439
0:18:29.96,000 --> 0:18:31,000
only science is even older.

440
0:18:32.804,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Our basis for trust in science is actually the same

441
0:18:35.378,000 --> 0:18:37,000
as our basis in trust in technology,

442
0:18:38.052,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and the same as our basis for trust in anything,

443
0:18:42.039,000 --> 0:18:44,000
namely, experience.

444
0:18:44.317,000 --> 0:18:45,000
But it shouldn't be blind trust

445
0:18:46.161,000 --> 0:18:48,000
any more than we would have blind trust in anything.

446
0:18:48.921,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Our trust in science, like science itself,

447
0:18:51.762,000 --> 0:18:52,000
should be based on evidence,

448
0:18:53.675,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and that means that scientists

449
0:18:55.177,000 --> 0:18:57,000
have to become better communicators.

450
0:18:57.225,000 --> 0:18:59,000
They have to explain to us not just what they know

451
0:19:00.112,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but how they know it,

452
0:19:01.84,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and it means that we have to become better listeners.

453
0:19:05.73,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Thank you very much.

454
0:19:07.149,000 --> 0:19:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about opening the space frontier.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I want to tell you that story.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We have something called the Genome 100 --

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Craig Venter chairs that event.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I met Professor Hawking,

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and he said his dream was to travel into space.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I said, "I can't take you there,

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.

20
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You do it again and again.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We set out to do this.

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It took us 11 years to become operational.

26
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.

27
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,

28
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And he wanted to go.

31
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We worked hard to get all the permissions.

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.

33
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We had a press conference,

34
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,

35
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
give him 25 seconds of zero-g.

36
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.

37
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.

38
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And what he said, for me, was very moving.

39
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk

40
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of being wiped out by disaster ...

41
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.

42
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."

43
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We had about 20 people who made donations --

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --

47
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
who flew with us.

48
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
A few TEDsters here.

49
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We set up a whole ER.

50
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.

51
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.

54
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We took off from the shuttle landing facility,

55
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where the shuttle takes off and lands.

56
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I

57
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
carefully suspended him into zero-g.

58
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Once he was there, [we] let him go

59
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to experience what weightlessness was truly like.

60
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And after that first parabola, you know,

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.

62
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So we did a second parabola.

63
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And a third.

66
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton

68
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge

69
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that Isaac Newton did.

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And a seventh and an eighth.

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He was so happy.

76
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We are living on a precious jewel,

77
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Please join us in this epic adventure.

79
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Thank you so much.

80
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.284,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want you to take a look at this baby.

2
0:00:19.439,000 --> 0:00:23,000
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch.

3
0:00:24.646,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see.

4
0:00:27.81,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What's going on up in that little brain of hers.

5
0:00:31.395,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us

6
0:00:35.34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.

7
0:00:39.996,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And what we're learning is going to shed some light

8
0:00:43.457,000 --> 0:00:48,000
on what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness"

9
0:00:49.379,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of the child's mind.

10
0:00:52.273,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What we see here is a mother in India,

11
0:00:55.755,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language.

12
0:01:00.057,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And she's talking to her baby.

13
0:01:02.349,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What this mother --

14
0:01:03.529,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world --

15
0:01:06.772,000 --> 0:01:09,000
understands is that, to preserve this language,

16
0:01:10.006,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they need to speak it to the babies.

17
0:01:12.616,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And therein lies a critical puzzle.

18
0:01:15.515,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Why is it that you can't preserve a language

19
0:01:17.789,000 --> 0:01:2,000
by speaking to you and I, to the adults?

20
0:01:21.048,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, it's got to do with your brain.

21
0:01:23.798,000 --> 0:01:27,000
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.

22
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.

23
0:01:32.084,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:34.791,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.

25
0:01:39.049,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven,

26
0:01:42.932,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and then there's a systematic decline.

27
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
After puberty, we fall off the map.

28
0:01:48.194,000 --> 0:01:5,000
No scientists dispute this curve,

29
0:01:50.75,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but laboratories all over the world

30
0:01:52.729,000 --> 0:01:54,000
are trying to figure out why it works this way.

31
0:01:55.778,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development,

32
0:01:59.836,000 --> 0:02:,000
and that is the period in which babies

33
0:02:01.705,000 --> 0:02:04,000
try to master which sounds are used in their language.

34
0:02:05.094,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We think, by studying how the sounds are learned,

35
0:02:07.608,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we'll have a model for the rest of language,

36
0:02:09.897,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood

37
0:02:12.859,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for social, emotional and cognitive development.

38
0:02:16.295,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we've been studying the babies

39
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
using a technique that we're using all over the world

40
0:02:20.787,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and the sounds of all languages.

41
0:02:22.667,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The baby sits on a parent's lap,

42
0:02:24.482,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes --

43
0:02:27.427,000 --> 0:02:28,000
like from "ah" to "ee."

44
0:02:28.909,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up

45
0:02:32.366,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and a panda bear pounds a drum.

46
0:02:34.374,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A six-monther adores the task.

47
0:02:37.42,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What have we learned?

48
0:02:38.605,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Well, babies all over the world

49
0:02:40.789,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are what I like to describe as "citizens of the world."

50
0:02:44.906,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages,

51
0:02:47.858,000 --> 0:02:5,000
no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using,

52
0:02:51.114,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that.

53
0:02:54.133,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We're culture-bound listeners.

54
0:02:56.128,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language,

55
0:02:58.547,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but not those of foreign languages.

56
0:03:00.418,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So the question arises: When do those citizens of the world

57
0:03:03.609,000 --> 0:03:05,000
turn into the language-bound listeners that we are?

58
0:03:06.517,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And the answer: before their first birthdays.

59
0:03:09.678,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What you see here is performance on that head-turn task

60
0:03:12.834,000 --> 0:03:14,000
for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States,

61
0:03:15.321,000 --> 0:03:16,000
here in Seattle,

62
0:03:16.783,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as they listened to "ra" and "la" --

63
0:03:18.556,000 --> 0:03:2,000
sounds important to English, but not to Japanese.

64
0:03:21.386,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent.

65
0:03:24.788,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Two months later, something incredible occurs.

66
0:03:27.366,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The babies in the United States are getting a lot better,

67
0:03:30.07,000 --> 0:03:31,000
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,

68
0:03:32.018,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language

69
0:03:35.492,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that they are going to learn.

70
0:03:37.008,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period?

71
0:03:41.656,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is the critical period for sound development,

72
0:03:44.023,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but what's going on up there?

73
0:03:45.462,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So there are two things going on.

74
0:03:47.465,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us,

75
0:03:50.365,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk --

76
0:03:54.122,000 --> 0:03:55,000
they're taking statistics.

77
0:03:56.127,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese --

78
0:03:58.69,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the universal language we use when we talk to kids --

79
0:04:01.756,000 --> 0:04:03,000
first in English and then in Japanese.

80
0:04:03.991,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --

81
0:04:07.454,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so pretty and nice.

82
0:04:11.309,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Japanese)

83
0:04:17.712,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen,

84
0:04:21.103,000 --> 0:04:25,000
what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear.

85
0:04:26.613,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And those distributions grow.

86
0:04:29.547,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics,

87
0:04:33.944,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different.

88
0:04:37.796,000 --> 0:04:39,000
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.

89
0:04:40.477,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The distribution shows.

90
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different,

91
0:04:45.124,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where we see a group of intermediate sounds,

92
0:04:48.149,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which is known as the Japanese "R."

93
0:04:50.588,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So babies absorb the statistics of the language

94
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it changes their brains;

95
0:04:56.422,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it changes them from the citizens of the world

96
0:04:58.597,000 --> 0:05:,000
to the culture-bound listeners that we are.

97
0:05:01.567,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.

98
0:05:06.304,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We are governed by the representations in memory

99
0:05:08.885,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that were formed early in development.

100
0:05:11.458,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So what we're seeing here

101
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is changing our models of what the critical period is about.

102
0:05:16.517,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint

103
0:05:19.31,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that the learning of language material may slow down

104
0:05:22.474,000 --> 0:05:24,000
when our distributions stabilize.

105
0:05:24.878,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people.

106
0:05:28.178,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once

107
0:05:32.233,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and flip between them, one after the other,

108
0:05:35.14,000 --> 0:05:36,000
depending on who they're speaking to.

109
0:05:36.936,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So we asked ourselves,

110
0:05:38.114,000 --> 0:05:41,000
can the babies take statistics on a brand new language?

111
0:05:41.545,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And we tested this by exposing American babies

112
0:05:44.847,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who'd never heard a second language

113
0:05:46.56,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period.

114
0:05:49.3,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle

115
0:05:52.861,000 --> 0:05:54,000
on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern.

116
0:05:55.547,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent.

117
0:05:58.042,000 --> 0:06:,000
Two months later, something incredible happens.

118
0:06:00.602,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies.

119
0:06:04.178,000 --> 0:06:08,000
What we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin.

120
0:06:09.084,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month

121
0:06:12.116,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.

122
0:06:15.937,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Here's what it looked like in the laboratory.

123
0:06:18.167,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Mandarin)

124
0:06:39.922,000 --> 0:06:41,000
PK: So what have we done to their little brains?

125
0:06:42.192,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We had to run a control group to make sure

127
0:06:46.955,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills.

128
0:06:50.191,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So a group of babies came in and listened to English.

129
0:06:52.868,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And we can see from the graph

130
0:06:54.294,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin.

131
0:06:56.901,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.

132
0:07:00.52,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan

133
0:07:02.944,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who'd been listening for 10 and a half months.

134
0:07:05.944,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language.

135
0:07:09.792,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.

136
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But we wondered what role

137
0:07:14.874,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the human being played in this learning exercise.

138
0:07:19.428,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage,

139
0:07:23.768,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the same 12 sessions, but over a television set.

140
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And another group of babies who had just audio exposure

141
0:07:29.945,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.

142
0:07:32.057,000 --> 0:07:34,000
What did we do to their brains?

143
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
What you see here is the audio result --

144
0:07:38.183,000 --> 0:07:39,000
no learning whatsoever --

145
0:07:39.945,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the video result --

146
0:07:42.496,000 --> 0:07:43,000
no learning whatsoever.

147
0:07:44.365,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics.

148
0:07:48.882,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The social brain is controlling

149
0:07:51.072,000 --> 0:07:53,000
when the babies are taking their statistics.

150
0:07:53.201,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening

151
0:07:56.718,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings.

152
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography,

153
0:08:05.401,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that allows us to do this.

154
0:08:06.718,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.

155
0:08:09.327,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent.

156
0:08:13.834,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We're looking at millimeter accuracy

157
0:08:16.301,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy

158
0:08:19.641,000 --> 0:08:21,000
using 306 SQUIDs --

159
0:08:22.287,000 --> 0:08:25,000
these are superconducting quantum interference devices --

160
0:08:25.411,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking.

161
0:08:29.509,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine

162
0:08:35.142,000 --> 0:08:37,000
while they are learning.

163
0:08:37.557,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So this is little Emma.

164
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
She's a six-monther.

165
0:08:41.192,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears.

166
0:08:46.334,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You can see, she can move around.

167
0:08:48.582,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap,

168
0:08:52.376,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so she's free to move completely unconstrained.

169
0:08:55.375,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's a technical tour de force.

170
0:08:57.612,000 --> 0:08:58,000
What are we seeing?

171
0:08:59.22,000 --> 0:09:,000
We're seeing the baby brain.

172
0:09:01.138,000 --> 0:09:06,000
As the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up,

173
0:09:06.448,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence,

174
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
getting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality,

175
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
one brain area causing another to activate.

176
0:09:18.861,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge

177
0:09:24.269,000 --> 0:09:26,000
about child's brain development.

178
0:09:26.529,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We're going to be able to see a child's brain

179
0:09:28.974,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read,

180
0:09:33.239,000 --> 0:09:36,000
as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea.

181
0:09:36.775,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions

182
0:09:40.148,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for children who have difficulty learning.

183
0:09:42.831,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Just as the poets and writers described,

184
0:09:45.921,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness,

185
0:09:50.099,000 --> 0:09:53,000
utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child.

186
0:09:54.284,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In investigating the child's brain,

187
0:09:56.984,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human,

188
0:10:01.004,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and in the process,

189
0:10:02.183,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning

190
0:10:05.278,000 --> 0:10:06,000
for our entire lives.

191
0:10:06.993,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Thank you.

192
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Applause)

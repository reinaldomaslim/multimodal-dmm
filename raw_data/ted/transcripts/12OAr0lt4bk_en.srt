1
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the dramatic moments of the birth

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of our first son, Declan.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Obviously a really profound moment,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and it changed our lives in many ways.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and a year later, we launched Babble,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a website for parents.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
AV: We did.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It was a website called Nerve.com,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the tagline of which was "literate smut."

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a smart online magazine

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about sex and culture.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
AV: That spawned a dating site.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which we did.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
was not just the life stage thing,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which is, of course, relevant,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but it was really more about

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
our desire to speak very honestly

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It seems to us that

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when people start dissembling, people start lying about things,

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that's when it gets really interesting.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That's a subject that we want to dive into.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that there are almost more taboos around parenting

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
than there are around sex.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
AV: It's true. So like we said,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the early years were really wonderful,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but they were also really difficult.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And we feel like some of that difficulty

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
was because of this false advertisement around parenting.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And we went into parenting

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
expecting our lives to look like this.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and in fact, it was not like that at all.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that we were looking at, with these beautiful images,

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and looked at the scene in our actual living room,

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it looked a little bit more like this.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
These are our three sons.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but with three boys, there's a decent probability

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that at least one of them will not be comporting himself

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
exactly as he should.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We really felt like what we went in expecting

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We really wanted to let them understand

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
RG: So today, what we would love to do

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is share with you four parenting taboos.

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And of course, there are many more than four things

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you can't say about parenting,

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but we would like to share with you today

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
four that are particularly relevant for us personally.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So the first, taboo number one:

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in the very first minute.

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
AV: We, or I?

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
RG: I'm sorry.

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Misuse of the pronoun.

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Alisa was very generously in the process

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I was there with my arms open.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The nurse was coming at me

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with this beautiful, beautiful child,

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I remember, as she was approaching me,

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the voices of friends saying,

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"The moment they put the baby in your hands,

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you will feel a sense of love that will come over you

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So I was bracing myself for the moment.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The baby was coming,

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I was ready for this Mack truck of love

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to just knock me off my feet.

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it was an extraordinary moment.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This picture is from literally a few seconds after

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And you can see, our eyes were glistening.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with deep, deep gratitude

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that we had what appeared to be a healthy child.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it was also, of course, surreal.

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And this was all quite remarkable.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And so we've done something here

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that is heretical.

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We have charted

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
our love for our child over time.

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This, as you know, is an act of heresy.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
You're not allowed to chart love.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The reason you're not allowed to chart love

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is because we think of love as a binary thing.

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You're either in love, or you're not in love.

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You love, or you don't love.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I think the reality is that love is a process,

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and I think the problem with thinking of love

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as something that's binary

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is that it causes us

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to be unduly concerned

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in the early months, maybe their first year,

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.

132
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,

133
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because you can notice where he dips in the first years

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where I think I was doing most of the work.

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But we like to joke,

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the first few months of all of our children's lives,

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
this is Uncle Rufus.

138
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.

140
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
amongst other babies.

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
RG: Uh oh.

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.

146
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
RG: The far left. AV: No!

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
RG: Cruel.

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
AV: Nothing more to be said.

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'll move on to taboo number two.

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
tracking it down till the actual due-date.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It was a really wonderful experience,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but when I got home,

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I suddenly felt very disconnected

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and suddenly shut in and shut out,

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and I was really surprised by those feelings.

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I did expect it to be difficult,

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
have sleepless nights, constant feedings,

170
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but I did not expect the feelings

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of isolation and loneliness that I experienced,

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that I was going to be feeling this way.

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I called my sister

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
whom I'm very close to -- and had three children --

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me

177
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I was going to be feeling this way,

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And she said -- I'll never forget --

180
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"It's just not something you want to say to a mother

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that's having a baby for the first time."

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
RG: And of course, we think

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's precisely what you really should be saying

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to mothers who have kids for the first time.

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is that we think

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that candor and brutal honesty

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is critical to us collectively

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
being great parents.

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And it's hard not to think

191
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that part of what leads to this sense of isolation

192
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is our modern world.

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So Alisa's experience is not isolated.

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
report feelings of loneliness.

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In the process of preparing this,

199
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we looked at how some other cultures around the world

200
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
deal with this period of time,

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because here in the Western world,

202
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,

203
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.

204
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So to take one example among many:

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in Southern India

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
there's a practice known as jholabhari,

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,

208
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
moves in with her mother

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
give birth and returns home to her nuclear family

211
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
several months after the child is born.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And this is one of many ways

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
AV: So taboo number three:

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.

216
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So after we had Declan,

217
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we kind of recalibrated our expectations.

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We thought we actually could go through this again

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and thought we knew what we would be up against.

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and I soon learned that we were having a boy,

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and then when I was five months,

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we learned that we had lost our child.

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is actually the last little image we have of him.

225
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it was obviously a very difficult time --

226
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
really painful.

227
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
As I was working through that mourning process,

228
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I really wanted to crawl into a hole,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I didn't really know how I was going

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to work my way back into my surrounding community.

232
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,

233
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is on a really deep gut level,

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I was feeling a lot of shame

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and embarrassed, frankly,

236
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that, in some respects, I had failed

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And of course, it made me question,

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
if I wasn't able to have another child,

240
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
what would that mean for my marriage,

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and just me as a woman.

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So it was a very difficult time.

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
As I started working through it more,

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.

245
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I was really amazed

246
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by all the stories that started flooding in.

247
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
People I interacted with daily,

248
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
worked with, was friends with,

249
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
family members that I had known a long time,

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
had never shared with me their own stories.

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,

252
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and I felt like I happened upon

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
this secret society of women that I now was a part of,

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which was reassuring and also really concerning.

255
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And I think,

256
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
miscarriage is an invisible loss.

257
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
There's not really a lot of community support around it.

258
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There's really no ceremony,

259
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
rituals, or rites.

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and there's a lot of community support,

262
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
RG: Which is too bad because, of course,

264
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it's a very common and very traumatic experience.

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,

266
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I find this astounding.

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In a survey, 74 percent of women said

268
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And astoundingly, 22 percent

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So taboo number four:

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
you can't say that your average happiness

273
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
has declined since having a child.

274
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The party line is that every single aspect of my life

275
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
has just gotten dramatically better

276
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
ever since I participated

277
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in the miracle that is childbirth and family.

278
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,

279
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
our first son, Declan, was nine months old,

280
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and I was sitting there on the couch,

281
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."

282
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I got about two-thirds of the way through,

283
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and there was a chart on the right-hand side --

284
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
on the right-hand page --

285
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that we've labeled here

286
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable

287
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
for a New Parent."

288
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.

289
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Basically, there's this precipitous drop

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of marital satisfaction,

291
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,

292
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that doesn't rise again

293
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
until your first child goes to college.

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
this chasm of happiness

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We were despondent.

298
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,

299
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but we'd come out of it,

300
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and were really shocked to see this study.

301
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it

302
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in hopes that we would find a silver lining.

303
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,

304
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because we got this incredible reporter

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to go and interview all the scientists

306
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
who conducted these four studies.

307
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We said, something is wrong here.

308
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
There's something missing from these studies.

309
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It can't possibly be that bad.

310
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and she interviewed four scientists,

312
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and we did indeed find a silver lining.

314
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So this is our guess

315
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
as to what this baseline of average happiness

316
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
arguably looks like throughout life.

317
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,

318
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because it doesn't speak

319
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to the moment-by-moment experience,

320
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and so this is what we think it looks like

321
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
when you layer in

322
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
moment-to-moment experience.

323
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And so we all remember as children,

324
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --

325
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the teeniest little thing

326
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
can just rocket them to these heights

327
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
of just utter adulation,

328
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and then the next teeniest little thing

329
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.

330
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.

331
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And then, of course, as you get older,

332
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it's almost like age is a form of lithium.

333
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
As you get older, you become more stable.

334
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,

335
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.

336
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
You start to realize that

337
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
"Hey, I could go to this live music event

338
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and have an utterly transforming experience

339
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
that will cover my entire body with goosebumps,

340
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic

341
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and I won't be able to get a beer.

342
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So I'm not going to go.

343
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."

344
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So your average happiness goes up,

345
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but you lose those transcendent moments.

346
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,

347
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and then you really resubmit yourself

348
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to these highs and lows --

349
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the highs being the first steps, the first smile,

350
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
your child reading to you for the first time --

351
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.

352
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But you realize you resubmit yourself

353
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to losing control in a really wonderful way,

354
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives

355
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and is quite gratifying.

356
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
RG: And so in effect,

357
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
we trade average happiness.

358
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We trade the sort of security and safety

359
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of a certain level of contentment

360
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
for these transcendent moments.

361
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So where does that leave the two of us

362
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
as a family with our three little boys

363
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in the thick of all this?

364
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
There's another factor in our case.

365
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We have violated yet another taboo

366
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in our own lives,

367
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and this is a bonus taboo.

368
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,

369
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
especially with three children --

370
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and we are.

371
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.

372
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.

373
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,

374
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the venture capitalists said,

375
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
"We categorically don't invest

376
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in companies founded by husbands and wives,

377
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
because there's an extra point of failure.

378
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's a bad idea. Don't do it."

379
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And we obviously went forward. We did.

380
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,

381
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because in this phase of one's life,

382
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
the incredibly scarce resource is time.

383
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --

384
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and you're also passionate about your relationship,

385
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
this is the only way we know how to do it.

386
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And so the final question that we would ask is:

387
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?

388
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,

389
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but they're sometimes pretty quick.

390
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And so how about that average baseline of happiness?

391
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Can we move that up a little bit?

392
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,

393
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is really the result of walking into parenting --

394
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and really any long-term partnership for that matter --

395
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
with the wrong expectations.

396
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,

397
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.

398
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
RG: And so this is what --

399
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And we think that a lot of parents,

400
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
when you get in there -- in our case anyway --

401
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.

402
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Get out of the airplane,

403
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.

404
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,

405
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
particularly if you pack your bags properly

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So the point of all this for us today

408
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,

409
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,

410
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that we can all collectively

411
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.

412
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
RG + AV: Thank you.

413
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

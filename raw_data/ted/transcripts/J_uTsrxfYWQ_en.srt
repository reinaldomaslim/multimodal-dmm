1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In the last 50 years,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we've been building the suburbs

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with a lot of unintended consequences.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I think give us tremendous reasons

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to be really optimistic

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that the big design and development project of the next 50 years

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is going to be retrofitting suburbia.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or reconstructing wetlands

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
out of parking lots,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I think the fact is

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the growing number

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of empty and under-performing,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
especially retail, sites

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
throughout suburbia

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
gives us actually a tremendous opportunity

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to take our least-sustainable

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
landscapes right now

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and convert them into

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
more sustainable places.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And in the process, what that allows us to do

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is to redirect a lot more of our growth

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
back into existing communities

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that could use a boost,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and have the infrastructure in place,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
instead of continuing

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to tear down trees

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and to tear up the green space out at the edges.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So why is this important?

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I think there are any number of reasons,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Just from the perspective of climate change,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the average urban dweller in the U.S.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
has about one-third the carbon footprint

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the average suburban dweller,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and living in detached buildings,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you have that much more exterior surface

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to leak energy out of.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So strictly from

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a climate change perspective,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the cities are already

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
relatively green.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The big opportunity

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is actually in urbanizing

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the suburbs.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's increased our dependence

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on foreign oil

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
despite the gains in fuel efficiency.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're just driving so much more;

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we haven't been able to keep up technologically.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Public health is another reason

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to consider retrofitting.

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Researchers at the CDC and other places

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
have increasingly been linking

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
suburban development patterns

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with sedentary lifestyles.

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And those have been linked then

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
with the rather alarming,

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
growing rates of obesity,

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
shown in these maps here,

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and that obesity has also been triggering

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
great increases in heart disease

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and diabetes

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to the point where a child born today

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
has a one-in-three chance

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of developing diabetes.

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
as children not walking

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to school anymore,

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
again, because of our development patterns.

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I mean, how affordable is it

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to continue to live in suburbia

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with rising gas prices?

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Suburban expansion to cheap land,

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for the last 50 years --

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you know the cheap land out on the edge --

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
has helped generations of families

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
enjoy the American dream.

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But increasingly,

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the savings promised

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --

90
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which is basically our model --

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
those savings are wiped out

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
when you consider the transportation costs.

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
For instance, here in Atlanta,

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about half of households

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they are spending 29 percent of their income

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
on housing

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and 32 percent

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
on transportation.

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I mean, that's 2005 figures.

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You know, none of us

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and they're not going down

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
any time soon.

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or you hate its soulless commercial strips,

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But is it practical?

110
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I think it is.

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic

112
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for over a decade,

113
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we've found over 80

114
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
varied projects.

115
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But that they're really all market driven,

116
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and what's driving the market in particular --

117
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
number one -- is major demographic shifts.

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We all tend to think of suburbia

119
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as this very family-focused place,

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but that's really not the case anymore.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Since 2000,

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
already two-thirds of households in suburbia

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
did not have kids in them.

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The reasons for this have a lot to with

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the dominance of the two big

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
demographic groups right now:

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the Baby Boomers retiring --

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and then there's a gap,

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Generation X, which is a small generation.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
They're still having kids --

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but Generation Y hasn't even started

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
hitting child-rearing age.

134
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They're the other big generation.

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So as a result of that,

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
demographers predict

137
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that through 2025,

138
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
75 to 85 percent of new households

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
will not have kids in them.

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And the market research, consumer research,

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
asking the Boomers and Gen Y

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
what it is they would like,

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
what they would like to live in,

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
tells us there is going to be a huge demand --

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we're already seeing it --

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for more urban lifestyles

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
within suburbia.

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,

149
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and Gen Y would like to live

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
an urban lifestyle,

151
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The other big dynamic of change

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is the sheer performance of

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
underperforming asphalt.

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for an indie rock band,

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but developers generally use it

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to refer to underused parking lots --

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and suburbia is full of them.

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
When the postwar suburbs were first built

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
out on the cheap land

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
away from downtown,

163
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it made sense to just build

164
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
surface parking lots.

165
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But those sites have now been leapfrogged

166
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and leapfrogged again,

167
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
as we've just continued to sprawl,

168
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and they now have

169
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a relatively central location.

170
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It no longer just makes sense.

171
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.

172
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It now makes sense to go back in,

173
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
build a deck and build up

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
on those sites.

175
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So what do you do

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with a dead mall,

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
dead office park?

178
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It turns out, all sorts of things.

179
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In a slow economy like ours,

180
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
re-inhabitation is

181
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
one of the more popular strategies.

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So this happens to be

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a dead mall in St. Louis

184
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that's been re-inhabited as art-space.

185
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's now home to artist studios,

186
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
theater groups, dance troupes.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
as it once was,

189
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but it's serving its community.

190
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's keeping the lights on.

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Other malls have been re-inhabited

193
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
as nursing homes,

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as universities,

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and as all variety of office space.

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We also found a lot of examples

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
of dead big-box stores

198
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that have been converted into

199
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
all sorts of community-serving uses as well --

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
lots of schools, lots of churches

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and lots of libraries like this one.

202
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,

203
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that is now a public library.

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,

205
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they tore up some of the parking spaces,

206
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,

207
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
put in a lot more sidewalks

208
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to connect to the neighborhoods.

209
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And they've made this,

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what was just a store along a commercial strip,

211
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
into a community gathering space.

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in Phoenix, Arizona.

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a gourmet grocery,

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.

217
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Never underestimate the power of food

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to turn a place around

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and make it a destination.

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The real estate ads in the neighborhood

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
all very proudly proclaim,

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"

224
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
because it provided its neighborhood

225
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with what sociologists like to call

226
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"a third place."

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If home is the first place

228
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and work is the second place,

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the third place is where you go to hang out

230
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and build community.

231
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And especially as suburbia is becoming

232
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
less centered on the family,

233
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the family households,

234
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
there's a real hunger

235
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
for more third places.

236
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So the most dramatic retrofits

237
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
are really those in the next category,

238
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the next strategy: redevelopment.

239
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, during the boom, there were several

240
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
really dramatic redevelopment projects

241
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
where the original building

242
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt

243
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at significantly greater density,

244
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.

245
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But some of them have been much more incremental.

246
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is Mashpee Commons,

247
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the oldest retrofit that we've found.

248
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
built urbanism

250
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
on top of its parking lots.

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So the black and white photo shows

252
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the simple 60's strip shopping center.

253
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And then the maps above that

254
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
show its gradual transformation

255
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
into a compact,

256
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
mixed-use New England village,

257
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and it has plans now that have been approved

258
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for it to connect

259
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to new residential neighborhoods

260
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
across the arterials

261
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and over to the other side.

262
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Sometimes, it's all at once.

264
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This is another infill project on the parking lots,

265
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.

266
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs

267
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and opened a station nearby to this site,

268
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the owners decided

269
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to build a new parking deck

270
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then insert on top of their surface lots

271
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a new Main Street, several apartments

272
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and condo buildings,

273
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
while keeping the existing office buildings.

274
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Here is the site in 1940:

275
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It was just a little farm

276
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the village of Hyattsville.

277
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
By 1980, it had been subdivided

278
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
into a big mall on one side

279
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and the office park on the other

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and then some buffer sites for a library

281
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and a church to the far right.

282
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Today, the transit,

283
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the Main Street and the new housing

284
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
have all been built.

285
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Eventually, I expect that the streets

286
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.

287
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Plans have already been announced

288
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
for a lot of those garden apartments

289
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
above the mall to be redeveloped.

290
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.

291
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So here's what it looks like.

292
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings

293
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in between the office buildings

294
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the public space and the new Main Street.

295
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.

296
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I think they really built an attractive place here

297
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and have just employed all-green construction.

298
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs

299
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
as well as wind turbines.

300
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This was a very large mall

301
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
on a hundred-acre superblock.

302
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's now 22

303
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
walkable urban blocks

304
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
with public streets,

305
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
two public parks, eight bus lines

306
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and a range of housing types,

307
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado

308
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the downtown

309
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that this particular suburb never had.

310
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Here was the mall in its heyday.

311
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.

312
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So here's the site in 1975

313
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
with the mall.

314
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
By 1995, the mall has died.

315
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The department store has been kept --

316
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and we found this was true in many cases.

317
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.

318
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They're easy to be re-adapted.

319
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But the one story stuff ...

320
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that's really history.

321
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So here it is at projected build-out.

322
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This project, I think, has great connectivity

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
to the existing neighborhoods.

324
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's providing 1,500 households with the option

325
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of a more urban lifestyle.

326
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's about two-thirds built out right now.

327
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.

328
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's very successful,

329
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and it's helped to prompt --

330
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
eight of the 13

331
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
regional malls in Denver

332
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
have now, or have announced plans to

333
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
be, retrofitted.

334
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting

335
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
is not occurring --

336
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.

337
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
No, it's pockets of walkability

338
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
on the sites of

339
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
under-performing properties.

340
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And so it's giving people more choices,

341
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but it's not taking away choices.

342
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But it's also not really enough

343
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to just create pockets of walkability.

344
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.

345
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.

346
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So this is one that has been

347
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
retrofitted in California.

348
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They took the commercial strip

349
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
shown on the black-and-white images below,

350
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and they built a boulevard

351
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that has become the Main Street for their town.

352
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it's transformed from being

353
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
an ugly, unsafe,

354
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
undesirable address,

355
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to becoming a beautiful,

356
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
attractive, dignified sort of good address.

357
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;

358
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.

359
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there

360
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
without tearing down another tree.

361
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So there's a lot of great things,

362
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.

363
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But densification

364
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
is not going to work everywhere.

365
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Sometimes re-greening

366
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is really the better answer.

367
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
There's a lot to learn from successful

368
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
landbanking programs

369
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in cities like Flint, Michigan.

370
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --

371
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.

372
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects

373
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is the opportunity to restore

374
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the local ecology,

375
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
as in this example outside of Minneapolis.

376
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
When the shopping center died,

377
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the city restored the site's

378
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
original wetlands,

379
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
creating lakefront property,

380
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
which then attracted private investment,

381
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood

382
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in over 40 years.

383
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology

384
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and the local economy at the same time.

385
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
This is another re-greening example.

386
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It also makes sense in very strong markets.

387
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
This one in Seattle

388
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is on the site of a mall parking lot

389
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
adjacent to a new transit stop.

390
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And the wavy line

391
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.

392
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.

393
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But daylighting our creeks

394
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
really improves their water quality

395
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and contributions to habitat.

396
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So I've shown you some of

397
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the first generation of retrofits.

398
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
What's next?

399
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I think we have three challenges for the future.

400
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
The first is to plan retrofitting

401
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
much more systemically

402
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
at the metropolitan scale.

403
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We need to be able to target

404
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
which areas really should be re-greened.

405
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Where should we be redeveloping?

406
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?

407
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
These slides just show two images

408
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
from a larger project

409
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.

410
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I led a team that was asked to imagine

411
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Atlanta 100 years from now.

412
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl

413
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.

414
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
One, in a hundred years,

415
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
transit on all major

416
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
rail and road corridors.

417
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Two, in a hundred years,

418
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
thousand foot buffers

419
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
on all stream corridors.

420
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.

421
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
In a hundred years,

422
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
subdivisions that simply end up too close to water

423
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
or too far from transit won't be viable.

424
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And so we've created the eco-acre

425
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
transfer-to-transfer development rights

426
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
to the transit corridors

427
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and allow the re-greening

428
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
of those former subdivisions

429
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
for food and energy production.

430
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So the second challenge

431
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is to improve the architectural design quality

432
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
of the retrofits.

433
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And I close with this image

434
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
of democracy in action:

435
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
This is a protest that's happening

436
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland

437
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
on an Astroturf town green.

438
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Now, retrofits are often accused

439
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
of being examples of faux downtowns

440
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and instant urbanism,

441
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and not without reason; you don't get much more phony

442
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
than an Astroturf town green.

443
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.

444
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
They are new but trying to look old.

445
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
They have urban streetscapes,

446
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
but suburban parking ratios.

447
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Their populations are

448
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
more diverse than typical suburbia,

449
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
but they're less diverse than cities.

450
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And they are

451
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
public places,

452
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
but that are managed by private companies.

453
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And just the surface appearance

454
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
are often -- like the Astroturf here --

455
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
they make me wince.

456
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that

457
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
the urbanism is doing its job.

458
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
The fact that a protest is happening

459
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
really does mean

460
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,

461
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
compromised as it may be,

462
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
is still a really great thing.

463
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
But we've got to get the architecture better.

464
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
The final challenge is for all of you.

465
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
I want you to join the protest

466
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and start demanding

467
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
more sustainable suburban places --

468
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
more sustainable places, period.

469
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
But culturally,

470
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
we tend to think that downtowns

471
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
should be dynamic, and we expect that.

472
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
But we seem to have an expectation

473
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
that the suburbs should forever remain frozen

474
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
in whatever adolescent form

475
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
they were first given birth to.

476
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
It's time to let them grow up,

477
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
so I want you

478
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to all support the zoning changes,

479
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
the road diets, the infrastructure improvements

480
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

481
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Thank you.

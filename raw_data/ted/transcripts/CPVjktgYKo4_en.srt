1
0:00:12.48,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The narrative of a rising Africa is being challenged.

2
0:00:16.36,000 --> 0:00:2,000
About 10 years ago, I spoke about an Africa,

3
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
an Africa of hope and opportunity,

4
0:00:23.56,000 --> 0:00:24,000
an Africa of entrepreneurs,

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an Africa very different from the Africa that you normally hear about

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of death, poverty and disease.

7
0:00:31.8,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that what I spoke about,

8
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:38,000
became part of what is known now as the narrative of the rising Africa.

9
0:00:39.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I want to tell you two stories about this rising Africa.

10
0:00:42.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The first has to do with Rwanda,

11
0:00:44.52,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a country that has gone through many trials and tribulations.

12
0:00:47.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And Rwanda has decided to become the technology hub, or a technology hub

13
0:00:52.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on the continent.

14
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a country with mountainous and hilly terrain,

15
0:00:56.88,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a little bit like here,

16
0:00:58.12,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so it's very difficult to deliver services to people.

17
0:01:01.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So what has Rwanda said?

18
0:01:03.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In order to save lives, it's going to try using drones

19
0:01:06.72,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to deliver lifesaving drugs, vaccines and blood

20
0:01:09.96,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to people in hard-to-reach places

21
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in partnership with a company called Zipline,

22
0:01:14.52,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with UPS, and also with the Gavi, a global vaccine alliance.

23
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In doing this, it will save lives.

24
0:01:21.48,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is part of the type of innovation we want to see in the rising Africa.

25
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The second story has to do with something

26
0:01:29.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that I'm sure most of you have seen or will remember.

27
0:01:32.4,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Very often, countries in Africa suffer drought and floods,

28
0:01:36.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it's getting more frequent because of climate change effects.

29
0:01:40.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When this happens, they normally wait for international appeals to raise money.

30
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You see pictures of children with flies on their faces,

31
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
carcasses of dead animals and so on.

32
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now these countries, 32 countries, came together

33
0:01:54.72,000 --> 0:01:56,000
under the auspices of the African Union

34
0:01:57.2,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and decided to form an organization called the African Risk Capacity.

35
0:02:02.24,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What does it do?

36
0:02:03.48,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's a weather-based insurance agency,

37
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and what these countries do is to pay insurance each year,

38
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about 3 million dollars a year of their own resources,

39
0:02:12.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so that in the event they have a difficult drought situation or flood,

40
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this money will be paid out to them,

41
0:02:20.44,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which they can then use to take care of their populations,

42
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
instead of waiting for aid to come.

43
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The African Risk Capacity last year paid 26 million dollars

44
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.

45
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This enabled them to take care of 1.3 million people affected by drought.

46
0:02:38.24,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They were able to restore livelihoods,

47
0:02:40.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
buy fodder for cattle, feed children in school

48
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and in short keep the populations home instead of migrating out of the area.

49
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So these are the kinds of stories

50
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of an Africa ready to take responsibility for itself,

51
0:02:54.64,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and to look for solutions for its own problems.

52
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But that narrative is being challenged now

53
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because the continent has not been doing well in the last two years.

54
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It had been growing at five percent per annum

55
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for the last one and a half decades,

56
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but this year's forecast was three percent. Why?

57
0:03:12.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In an uncertain global environment, commodity prices have fallen.

58
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Many of the economies are still commodity driven,

59
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and therefore their performance has slipped.

60
0:03:23.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And now the issue of Brexit doesn't make it any easier.

61
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I never knew that the Brexit could happen

62
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty

63
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:36,000
such as we have.

64
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So now we've got this situation,

65
0:03:38.8,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I think it's time to take stock

66
0:03:41.68,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and to say what were the things that the African countries did right?

67
0:03:46.56,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What did they do wrong?

68
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
How do we build on all of this and learn lessons

69
0:03:51.32,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so that we can keep Africa rising?

70
0:03:54.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So let me talk about six things that I think we did right.

71
0:03:58.72,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The first is managing our economies better.

72
0:04:02.04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The '80s and '90s were the lost decades, when Africa was not doing well,

73
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and some of you will remember an "Economist" cover

74
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that said, "The Lost Continent."

75
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But in the 2000s, policymakers learned

76
0:04:16.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that they needed to manage the macroeconomic environment better,

77
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to ensure stability,

78
0:04:21.96,000 --> 0:04:23,000
keep inflation low in single digits,

79
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
keep their fiscal deficits low, below three percent of GDP,

80
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:33,000
give investors, both domestic and foreign,

81
0:04:34.12,000 --> 0:04:37,000
some stability so they'll have confidence to invest in these economies.

82
0:04:37.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So that was number one.

83
0:04:39.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Two, debt.

84
0:04:40.84,000 --> 0:04:45,000
In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio of African countries was 130 percent,

85
0:04:46.56,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they didn't have fiscal space.

86
0:04:48.84,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They couldn't use their resources to invest in their development

87
0:04:51.88,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because they were paying debt.

88
0:04:53.36,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There may be some of you in this room who worked to support African countries

89
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to get debt relief.

90
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So private creditors, multilaterals and bilaterals came together

91
0:05:03.92,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and decided to do the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative

92
0:05:07.56,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and give debt relief.

93
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So this debt relief in 2005

94
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:13,000
made the debt-to-GDP ratio fall down to about 30 percent,

95
0:05:14.92,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and there was enough resources to try and reinvest.

96
0:05:18.84,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The third thing was loss-making enterprises.

97
0:05:21.32,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Governments were involved in business

98
0:05:23.4,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which they had no business being in.

99
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And they were running businesses, they were making losses.

100
0:05:28.8,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So some of these enterprises were restructured,

101
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
commercialized, privatized or closed,

102
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and they became less of a burden on government.

103
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The fourth thing was a very interesting thing.

104
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The telecoms revolution came,

105
0:05:43.52,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and African countries jumped on it.

106
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.

107
0:05:48.76,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Today, we have about 687 million mobile lines on the continent.

108
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And this has enabled us

109
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to go, move forward with some mobile technology

110
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
where Africa is actually leading.

111
0:06:01.28,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In Kenya, the development of mobile money --

112
0:06:03.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
M-Pesa, which all of you have heard about --

113
0:06:06.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it took some time for the world to notice that Africa was ahead

114
0:06:10.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in this particular technology.

115
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And this mobile money is also providing a platform

116
0:06:14.92,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for access to alternative energy.

117
0:06:17.4,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You know, people who can now pay for solar

118
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the same way they pay for cards for their telephone.

119
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So this was a very good development, something that went right.

120
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We also invested more in education and health, not enough,

121
0:06:34.76,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but there were some improvements.

122
0:06:36.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
250 million children were immunized in the last one and a half decades.

123
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The other thing was that conflicts decreased.

124
0:06:45.92,000 --> 0:06:47,000
There were many conflicts on the continent.

125
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Many of you are aware of that.

126
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But they came down, and our leaders even managed to dampen some coups.

127
0:06:54.32,000 --> 0:06:58,000
New types of conflicts have emerged, and I'll refer to those later.

128
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So based on all this, there's also some differentiation on the continent

129
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that I want you to know about,

130
0:07:03.52,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because even as the doom and gloom is here,

131
0:07:06.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there are some countries -- Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia,

132
0:07:10.04,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Tanzania and Senegal are performing relatively well at the moment.

133
0:07:15.12,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But what did we do wrong?

134
0:07:17.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Let me mention eight things.

135
0:07:18.68,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You have to have more things wrong than right.

136
0:07:20.88,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So there are eight things we did wrong.

138
0:07:24.76,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The first was that even though we grew, we didn't create enough jobs.

139
0:07:28.8,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We didn't create jobs for our youth.

140
0:07:30.72,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Youth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent,

141
0:07:33.68,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and underemployment is a serious problem.

142
0:07:37.4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough.

143
0:07:42.96,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Even those jobs we created were low-productivity jobs,

144
0:07:46.52,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so we moved people from low-productivity agriculture

145
0:07:50.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to low-productivity commerce and working in the informal sector

146
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in the urban areas.

147
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The third thing is that inequality increased.

148
0:08:00.6,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So we created more billionaires.

149
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars

150
0:08:08.32,000 --> 0:08:12,000
own more wealth than the bottom 75 million people on the continent.

151
0:08:13.92,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Poverty,

152
0:08:15.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the proportion of people in poverty -- that's the fourth thing -- did decrease,

153
0:08:19.92,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but the absolute numbers did not because of population growth.

154
0:08:24.04,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And population growth is something

155
0:08:26.64,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that we don't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent.

156
0:08:30.08,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And I think we will need to get a handle on it,

157
0:08:33.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
particularly how we educate girls.

158
0:08:36.52,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That is the road to really working on this particular issue.

159
0:08:41.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The fifth thing is that we didn't invest enough in infrastructure.

160
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We had investment from the Chinese.

161
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That helped some countries, but it's not enough.

162
0:08:54.08,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The consumption of electricity in Africa on the continent

163
0:08:57.44,000 --> 0:09:,000
in Sub-Saharan Africa is equivalent to Spain.

164
0:09:01.04,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The total consumption is equivalent to that of Spain.

165
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So many people are living in the dark,

166
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and as the President of the African Development Bank said recently,

167
0:09:10.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Africa cannot develop in the dark.

168
0:09:14.12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The other thing we have not done

169
0:09:16.28,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is that our economies retain the same structure

170
0:09:21.72,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that we've had for decades.

171
0:09:23.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So even though we've been growing,

172
0:09:25.04,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the structure of the economies has not changed very much.

173
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We are still exporting commodities,

174
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and exporting commodities is what? It's exporting jobs.

175
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Our manufacturing value-added is only 11 percent.

176
0:09:37.56,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,

177
0:09:42.12,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and trade among ourselves is low.

178
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Only about 12 percent of our trade is among ourselves.

179
0:09:48.28,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So that's another serious problem.

180
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Then governance.

181
0:09:53.12,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Governance is a serious issue.

182
0:09:55.56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We have weak institutions,

183
0:09:57.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and sometimes nonexistent institutions, and I think this gives way for corruption.

184
0:10:02.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Corruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on,

185
0:10:08.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we have to fight tooth and nail,

186
0:10:10.72,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies

187
0:10:14.32,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and the way we manage our finances.

188
0:10:16.8,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We also need to be wary of new conflicts,

189
0:10:21.56,000 --> 0:10:22,000
new types of conflicts,

190
0:10:23.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
such as we have with Boko Haram in my country, Nigeria,

191
0:10:26.76,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.

192
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We need to partner with international partners,

193
0:10:32.2,000 --> 0:10:34,000
developed countries, to fight this together.

194
0:10:35.08,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Otherwise, we create a new reality

195
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which is not the type we want for a rising Africa.

196
0:10:40.28,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And finally, the issue of education.

197
0:10:43.84,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Our education systems in many countries are broken.

198
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We are not creating the types of skills needed for the future.

199
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we have to find a way to educate better.

200
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So those are the things that we are not doing right.

201
0:10:58.24,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now, where do we go from there?

202
0:11:01.24,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success.

203
0:11:05.96,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Very often, when people succeed or countries succeed,

204
0:11:09.72,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they forget what made them succeed.

205
0:11:12.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Learning what you're successful at,

206
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
managing it and keeping it is vital for us.

207
0:11:17.68,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So all those things I said we did right,

208
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we have to learn to do it right again, keep doing it right.

209
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Managing the economy while creating stability is vital,

210
0:11:27.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
getting prices right, and policy consistency.

211
0:11:30.96,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Very often, we are not consistent.

212
0:11:33.36,000 --> 0:11:35,000
One regime goes out, another comes in

213
0:11:35.64,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and they throw away even the functioning policies that were there before.

214
0:11:39.12,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What does this do?

215
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It creates uncertainty for people, for households,

216
0:11:42.8,000 --> 0:11:43,000
uncertainties for business.

217
0:11:44.2,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They don't know whether and how to invest.

218
0:11:46.92,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Debt: we must manage the success we had in reducing our debt,

219
0:11:51.28,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but now countries are back to borrowing again,

220
0:11:53.84,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we see our debt-to-GDP ratio beginning to creep up,

221
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and in certain countries,

222
0:11:58.76,000 --> 0:12:,000
debt is becoming a problem, so we have to avoid that.

223
0:12:01.28,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So managing success.

224
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The next thing is focusing with a laser beam

225
0:12:05.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
on those things we did not do well.

226
0:12:07.32,000 --> 0:12:08,000
First and foremost is infrastructure.

227
0:12:09.2,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Yes, most countries now recognize they have to invest in this,

228
0:12:12.8,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and they are trying to do the best they can to do that.

229
0:12:15.44,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We must.

230
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The most important thing is power.

231
0:12:18.36,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You cannot develop in the dark.

232
0:12:20.64,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And then governance and corruption:

233
0:12:22.92,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we have to fight.

234
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We have to make our countries transparent.

235
0:12:26.96,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And above all, we have to engage our young people.

236
0:12:30.56,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We have genius in our young people.

237
0:12:32.8,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I see it every day.

238
0:12:34.08,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's what makes me wake up in the morning and feel ready to go.

239
0:12:37.64,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We have to unleash the genius of our young people,

240
0:12:40.04,000 --> 0:12:43,000
get out of their way, support them to create and innovate

241
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and lead the way.

242
0:12:44.56,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I know that they will lead us in the right direction.

243
0:12:47.28,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And our women, and our girls:

244
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
we have to recognize that girls and women are a gift.

245
0:12:52.56,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They have strength,

246
0:12:54.08,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and we have to unleash that strength

247
0:12:56.24,000 --> 0:12:58,000
so that they can contribute to the continent.

248
0:12:59.2,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I strongly believe that when we do all of these things,

249
0:13:03.04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we find that the rising Africa narrative

250
0:13:06.28,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is not a fluke.

251
0:13:07.88,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's a trend.

252
0:13:09.72,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's a trend, and if we continue, if we unleash our youth,

253
0:13:13.56,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if we unleash our women,

254
0:13:14.92,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we may step backwards sometimes,

255
0:13:16.96,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we may even step sideways,

256
0:13:18.88,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but the trend is clear.

257
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Africa will continue to rise.

258
0:13:22.56,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And I tell you businesspeople in the audience,

259
0:13:26.32,000 --> 0:13:29,000
investment in Africa is not for today, is not for tomorrow,

260
0:13:29.8,000 --> 0:13:32,000
it's not a short-term thing, it's a longer term thing.

261
0:13:33.08,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But if you are not invested in Africa,

262
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:36,000
then you will be missing

263
0:13:36.96,000 --> 0:13:4,000
one of the most important emerging opportunities in the world.

264
0:13:41.24,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you.

265
0:13:42.48,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

266
0:13:51.227,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned corruption in your talk,

267
0:13:53.92,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and you're known, well-known as a strong anticorruption fighter.

268
0:13:57.44,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But that's had consequences.

269
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
People have fought back, and your mother was kidnapped.

270
0:14:02.96,000 --> 0:14:03,000
How have you been handling this?

271
0:14:05.28,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: It's been very difficult.

272
0:14:07.48,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you for mentioning the issue of the kidnap of my mother.

273
0:14:11.84,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It's a very difficult subject.

274
0:14:14.44,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But what it means is that when you fight corruption,

275
0:14:18.32,000 --> 0:14:21,000
when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money,

276
0:14:21.76,000 --> 0:14:22,000
they don't just keep quiet.

277
0:14:23.64,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They fight back, and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you,

278
0:14:27.32,000 --> 0:14:3,000
do you give up, or do you fight on?

279
0:14:30.8,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Do you find a way to stay on and fight back?

280
0:14:33.96,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And the answer that I had with the teams I worked with

281
0:14:38.24,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is we have to fight on.

282
0:14:40.04,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We have to create those institutions.

283
0:14:41.88,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We have to find ways to stop these people

284
0:14:45.12,000 --> 0:14:48,000
from taking away the heritage of the future.

285
0:14:48.32,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And so that's what we did.

286
0:14:50.24,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And even out of government, we continued to make that point.

287
0:14:53.88,000 --> 0:14:56,000
In our countries, nobody, nobody is going to fight corruption

288
0:14:57.88,000 --> 0:14:58,000
for us but us.

289
0:14:59.44,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And therefore, that comes with consequences,

290
0:15:01.68,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and we just have to do the best we can.

291
0:15:03.6,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But I thank you and thank TED for giving us a voice

292
0:15:07.04,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to say to those people, you will not win,

293
0:15:10.36,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and we will not be intimidated.

294
0:15:12.72,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Thank you.

295
0:15:13.96,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

296
0:15:15.2,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much for your great talk and important work.

297
0:15:18.69,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

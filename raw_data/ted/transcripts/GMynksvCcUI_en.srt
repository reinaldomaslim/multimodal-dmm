2
0:00:15.838,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, I was introduced as

3
0:00:18.756,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the former Governor of Michigan,

4
0:00:20.788,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but actually I'm a scientist.

5
0:00:23.804,000 --> 0:00:25,000
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,

6
0:00:26.796,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy

7
0:00:30.592,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,

8
0:00:33.748,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was experimenting with policy

9
0:00:36.59,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about what would achieve the greatest good

10
0:00:39.284,000 --> 0:00:41,000
for the greatest number.

11
0:00:41.393,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But there were three problems, three enigmas

12
0:00:45.671,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that I could not solve,

13
0:00:48.205,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I want to share with you those problems,

14
0:00:51.683,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but most importantly,

15
0:00:53.689,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.

16
0:00:57.445,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The first problem

17
0:00:59.314,000 --> 0:01:,000
that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,

18
0:01:01.305,000 --> 0:01:04,000
how do you create good jobs in America

19
0:01:04.624,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in a global economy?

20
0:01:06.372,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.

21
0:01:09.864,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,

22
0:01:14.374,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I got a call from one of my staff members, who said,

23
0:01:16.906,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"Gov, we have a big problem.

24
0:01:19.274,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,

25
0:01:22.894,000 --> 0:01:24,000
population 8,000,

26
0:01:25.156,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and they are about to lose their major employer,

27
0:01:27.951,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."

28
0:01:32.77,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"

29
0:01:35.449,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."

30
0:01:40.379,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So it is a one-company town.

31
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.

32
0:01:48.088,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.

33
0:01:50.976,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville

34
0:01:53.264,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with my whole cabinet and we will just

35
0:01:55.232,000 --> 0:01:57,000
make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."

36
0:01:58.137,000 --> 0:02:,000
So I brought my whole cabinet,

37
0:02:00.568,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville --

38
0:02:04.28,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college --

39
0:02:07.51,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and we basically emptied our pockets

40
0:02:11.105,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and put all of our chips on the table,

41
0:02:14.398,000 --> 0:02:18,000
incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,

42
0:02:18.526,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and as we made our pile of chips,

43
0:02:20.177,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.

44
0:02:25.284,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,

45
0:02:29.392,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,

46
0:02:33.608,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,

47
0:02:36.401,000 --> 0:02:39,000
said they would offer unprecedented concessions,

48
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:44,000
sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.

49
0:02:44.293,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So the management of Electrolux took our pile,

50
0:02:47.171,000 --> 0:02:49,000
our list of incentives, and they went outside the room

51
0:02:49.984,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for 17 minutes,

52
0:02:52.504,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and they came back in and they said,

53
0:02:54.735,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"Wow, this is the most generous

54
0:02:57.676,000 --> 0:03:01,000
any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.

55
0:03:02.165,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But there's nothing you can do

56
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour

57
0:03:09.849,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."

58
0:03:13.107,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And they did. And when they did, it was like

59
0:03:16.112,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.

60
0:03:19.368,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In fact, they did implode the factory.

61
0:03:21.683,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.

62
0:03:25.661,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,

63
0:03:29.685,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,

64
0:03:32.325,000 --> 0:03:37,000
had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.

65
0:03:37.99,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,

66
0:03:40.973,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor

67
0:03:45.462,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,

68
0:03:49.359,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and I wanted to grieve with them,

69
0:03:51.882,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.

70
0:03:55.202,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches

71
0:03:58.945,000 --> 0:04:02,000
on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,

72
0:04:03.105,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)

73
0:04:06.842,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And this guy comes up to me,

74
0:04:10.069,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,

75
0:04:13.809,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and he had his two daughters with him,

76
0:04:16.427,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."

77
0:04:20.034,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He said, "I'm 48 years old,

78
0:04:23.082,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.

79
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I went from high school to factory.

80
0:04:30.296,000 --> 0:04:32,000
My father worked at this factory," he said.

81
0:04:32.904,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"My grandfather worked at this factory.

82
0:04:35.753,000 --> 0:04:4,000
All I know is how to make refrigerators."

83
0:04:40.776,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And he looked at his daughters,

84
0:04:42.129,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and he puts his hand on his chest,

85
0:04:44.617,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and he says, "So, Gov, tell me,

86
0:04:47.167,000 --> 0:04:52,000
who is ever going to hire me?

87
0:04:52.495,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Who is ever going to hire me?"

88
0:04:55.928,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And that was asked not just by that guy

89
0:04:59.45,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but by everyone in the pavilion,

90
0:05:02.128,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories

91
0:05:07.968,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that closed in the first decade of this century.

92
0:05:12.28,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs

93
0:05:15.174,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in America in a global economy?

94
0:05:17.607,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Number two, very quickly:

95
0:05:19.907,000 --> 0:05:21,000
How do you solve global climate change

96
0:05:22.639,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country

97
0:05:26.976,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?

98
0:05:31.904,000 --> 0:05:34,000
In fact, there was a poll that was done recently

99
0:05:35.066,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings

100
0:05:39.343,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to a number of other unpleasant things,

101
0:05:41.773,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating

102
0:05:45.293,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is worse than cockroaches,

103
0:05:48.175,000 --> 0:05:54,000
lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)

104
0:05:55.167,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But wait, the good news is it's at least better

105
0:05:59.446,000 --> 0:06:03,000
than meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)

106
0:06:04.302,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We got a problem, folks.

107
0:06:08.127,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So it got me thinking, what is it?

108
0:06:09.765,000 --> 0:06:12,000
What in the laboratory that I see out there,

109
0:06:13.527,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?

110
0:06:15.677,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What policy prescriptions have happened

111
0:06:18.376,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that actually cause changes to occur

112
0:06:20.168,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?

113
0:06:23.735,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So if I asked you, for example,

114
0:06:25.013,000 --> 0:06:27,000
what was the Obama Administration policy

115
0:06:27.493,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that caused massive changes across the country,

116
0:06:30.607,000 --> 0:06:31,000
what would you say?

117
0:06:31.895,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.

118
0:06:35.69,000 --> 0:06:37,000
As we know, only half the states have opted in.

119
0:06:38.231,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.

120
0:06:41.74,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur

121
0:06:46.091,000 --> 0:06:48,000
was Race to the Top for education.

122
0:06:48.511,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot

123
0:06:51.753,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.

124
0:06:55.199,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Forty-eight governors competed,

125
0:06:58.375,000 --> 0:07:01,000
convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially

126
0:07:01.674,000 --> 0:07:03,000
raise standards for high schoolers

127
0:07:03.96,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so that they all take a college prep curriculum.

128
0:07:06.271,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.

129
0:07:11.657,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that

130
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?

131
0:07:18.306,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Because after all, if you look at the context,

132
0:07:20.657,000 --> 0:07:23,000
1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years

133
0:07:24.635,000 --> 0:07:25,000
from the private sector globally,

134
0:07:26.577,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and every dollar represents a job,

135
0:07:28.949,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and where are those jobs going?

136
0:07:30.544,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.

137
0:07:32.968,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,

138
0:07:34.99,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,

139
0:07:37.698,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations

140
0:07:40.701,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and standing next to one of the Chinese officials,

141
0:07:43.064,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and we were watching, and he says,

142
0:07:44.726,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"

143
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I said, "Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?"

144
0:07:52.928,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And this is what he did, he goes, he says,

145
0:07:56.942,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Take your time."

146
0:07:59.679,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity.

147
0:08:04.317,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So what if we decided to create

148
0:08:07.25,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a challenge to the governors of the country,

149
0:08:09.949,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and the price to entry into this competition

150
0:08:12.755,000 --> 0:08:15,000
used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress

151
0:08:16.403,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,

152
0:08:19.093,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than

153
0:08:21.476,000 --> 0:08:23,000
one tenth of one percent of federal spending.

154
0:08:23.965,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's a rounding error on the federal side.

155
0:08:25.989,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But price to entry into that competition would be,

156
0:08:29.907,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you could just, say, use the President's goal.

157
0:08:33.212,000 --> 0:08:36,000
He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard

158
0:08:36.285,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of 80 percent by 2030,

159
0:08:38.56,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent

160
0:08:40.539,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.

161
0:08:44.189,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?

162
0:08:46.89,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And imagine what might happen,

163
0:08:48.881,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because every region has something to offer.

164
0:08:50.869,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You might take states like Iowa and Ohio --

165
0:08:53.851,000 --> 0:08:55,000
two very important political states, by the way --

166
0:08:55.868,000 --> 0:08:56,000
those two governors, and they would say,

167
0:08:57.756,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we're going to lead the nation in producing

168
0:09:00.471,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the wind turbines and the wind energy.

169
0:09:03.073,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You might say the solar states, the sun belt,

170
0:09:06.244,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,

171
0:09:09.944,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create

172
0:09:12.114,000 --> 0:09:14,000
an industry cluster in California

173
0:09:14.291,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to be able to produce the solar panels

174
0:09:16.13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so that we're not buying them from China

175
0:09:17.779,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but we're buying them from the U.S."

176
0:09:19.642,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In fact, every region of the country could do this.

177
0:09:23.072,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.

178
0:09:27.178,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states

179
0:09:31.182,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in the West, they could do geothermal,

180
0:09:33.357,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or you could look at Texas and say,

181
0:09:35.669,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.

182
0:09:39.037,000 --> 0:09:43,000
In the middle eastern states which have access to forests

183
0:09:43.144,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and to agricultural waste, they might say,

184
0:09:45.468,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.

185
0:09:48.069,000 --> 0:09:5,000
In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation

186
0:09:50.585,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in energy efficiency solutions.

187
0:09:53.449,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation

188
0:09:56.418,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in offshore wind.

189
0:09:58.237,000 --> 0:10:,000
You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation

190
0:10:00.82,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.

191
0:10:04.714,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Every region has something to offer,

192
0:10:08.121,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and if you created a competition,

193
0:10:10.443,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it respects the states and it respects federalism.

194
0:10:14.561,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,

195
0:10:18.115,000 --> 0:10:2,000
who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,

196
0:10:20.785,000 --> 0:10:22,000
you might even get them to opt in. Why?

197
0:10:23.186,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because Republican and Democratic governors

198
0:10:25.737,000 --> 0:10:26,000
love to cut ribbons.

199
0:10:27.391,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.

200
0:10:31.705,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And it fosters innovation at the state level

201
0:10:34.325,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in these laboratories of democracy.

202
0:10:36.786,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately

203
0:10:41.092,000 --> 0:10:43,000
might say, "Okay, great idea, but really?

204
0:10:43.849,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?

205
0:10:46.481,000 --> 0:10:48,000
They can't agree to anything."

206
0:10:48.754,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So you could wait and go through Congress,

207
0:10:52.049,000 --> 0:10:54,000
although you should be very impatient.

208
0:10:54.625,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.

209
0:11:02.529,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Go around Congress.

210
0:11:04.087,000 --> 0:11:1,000
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?

211
0:11:10.715,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What if several of the high-net worth companies

212
0:11:15.675,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and individuals who are here at TED decided

213
0:11:20.065,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that they would create, band together, just a couple of them,

214
0:11:23.593,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and create a national competition to the governors

215
0:11:27.153,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to have a race to the top

216
0:11:29.409,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and see how the governors respond?

217
0:11:32.078,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What if it all started here at TED?

218
0:11:36.966,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What if you were here

219
0:11:39.625,000 --> 0:11:44,000
when we figured out how to crack the code

220
0:11:44.973,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to create good paying jobs in America -- (Applause) --

221
0:11:50.419,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and get national energy policy

222
0:11:54.14,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?

223
0:12:00.118,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Because, dear TEDsters,

224
0:12:03.569,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if you are impatient like I am,

225
0:12:06.331,000 --> 0:12:09,000
you know that our economic competitors,

226
0:12:09.889,000 --> 0:12:12,000
our other nations, are in the game

227
0:12:13.329,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and are eating us for lunch.

228
0:12:15.681,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And we can get in the game or not.

229
0:12:20.227,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We can be at the table or we can be on the table.

230
0:12:24.546,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I don't know about you,

231
0:12:26.967,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but I prefer to dine.

232
0:12:29.674,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you all so much. (Applause)

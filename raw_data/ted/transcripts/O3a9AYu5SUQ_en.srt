1
0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm an underwater explorer,

2
0:00:17.48,000 --> 0:00:19,000
more specifically a cave diver.

3
0:00:21.2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid,

4
0:00:23.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me.

5
0:00:29.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space

6
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:37,000
than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet,

7
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.

8
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable.

9
0:00:45.12,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Instead of exploring outer space,

10
0:00:47.6,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.

11
0:00:51.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, a lot of people will tell you

12
0:00:53.6,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors.

13
0:00:58.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
I mean, imagine yourself here in this room,

14
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
if you were suddenly plunged into blackness,

15
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with your only job to find the exit,

16
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
sometimes swimming through these large spaces,

17
0:01:09.2,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and at other times crawling beneath the seats,

18
0:01:12.56,000 --> 0:01:14,000
following a thin guideline,

19
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:19,000
just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath.

20
0:01:19.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well, that's my workplace.

21
0:01:22.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But what I want to teach you today

22
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is that our world is not one big solid rock.

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.

24
0:01:31.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge,

25
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but where I can't,

26
0:01:37.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me.

27
0:01:42.32,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And my voice is the one that's going to teach you

28
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
about the inside of Mother Earth.

29
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There was no guidebook available to me

30
0:01:53.64,000 --> 0:01:59,000
when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.

31
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet.

32
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,

33
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology

34
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and search for life-forms beneath the ice.

35
0:02:12.44,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We use a technology called rebreathers.

36
0:02:15.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks.

37
0:02:19.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This technology enables us to go deeper

38
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than we could've imagined even 10 years ago.

39
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We use exotic gases,

40
0:02:27.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.

41
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I work with biologists.

42
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms,

43
0:02:39.92,000 --> 0:02:41,000
species that we never knew existed before.

44
0:02:43.76,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways.

45
0:02:47.08,000 --> 0:02:5,000
They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases,

46
0:02:51.04,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and these animals are also extremely long-lived.

47
0:02:55.56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
In fact, animals swimming in these caves today

48
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
are identical in the fossil record

49
0:03:01.56,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs.

50
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs.

51
0:03:08.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What can they teach us about evolution and survival?

52
0:03:13.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar,

53
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
he has giant fangs with venom.

54
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.

55
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If he were the size of a cat,

56
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
he'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet.

57
0:03:29.92,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places,

58
0:03:33.2,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and in some cases, caves like this, that are very young,

59
0:03:37.84,000 --> 0:03:38,000
yet the animals are ancient.

60
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:4,000
How did they get there?

61
0:03:41.88,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I also work with physicists,

62
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they're interested oftentimes in global climate change.

63
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They can take rocks within the caves,

64
0:03:50.04,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks,

65
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
much like the rings of a tree,

66
0:03:55.08,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and they can count back in history

67
0:03:57.12,000 --> 0:04:,000
and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times.

68
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The red that you see in this photograph

69
0:04:03.36,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.

70
0:04:06.72,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean.

71
0:04:10.84,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.

72
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It soaks in through the ground

73
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves.

74
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times

75
0:04:24.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
when the climate was very, very dry on earth,

76
0:04:27.52,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.

77
0:04:32.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Paleoclimatologists are also interested

78
0:04:34.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth.

79
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked

80
0:04:40.4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region,

81
0:04:43.48,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and we were looking for places

82
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline,

83
0:04:48.68,000 --> 0:04:5,000
many hundreds of feet below current levels.

84
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists.

85
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:05:,000
In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,

86
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves,

87
0:05:05.52,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they tell us a lot

88
0:05:06.8,000 --> 0:05:09,000
about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions.

89
0:05:10.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago,

90
0:05:14.28,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when I was a part of the team that made the very first

91
0:05:16.828,000 --> 0:05:19,000
accurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface.

92
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This device that I'm driving through the cave

93
0:05:22.56,000 --> 0:05:26,000
was actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it.

94
0:05:27.04,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We also used ultra low frequency radio

95
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave.

96
0:05:34.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses,

97
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,

98
0:05:43.08,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me

99
0:05:45.2,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was that everything we do on the surface of our earth

100
0:05:48.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
will be returned to us to drink.

101
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Our water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans,

102
0:05:55.36,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together.

103
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's a shared resource from which we all drink.

104
0:06:04.04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater

105
0:06:08.36,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and all of our water resources on this planet,

106
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:12,000
then we'll be working on the problem

107
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that's probably the most important issue of this century.

108
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be,

109
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but this mapping device, designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.

110
0:06:24.12,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's actually morphed.

111
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,

112
0:06:28.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
artificially intelligent,

113
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa

114
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body.

115
0:06:39.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that's pretty amazing.

116
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Applause)

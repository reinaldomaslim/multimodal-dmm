1
0:00:15.631,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers

2
0:00:18.399,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you hope you're not going to meet at TED.

3
0:00:21.614,000 --> 0:00:22,000
First, I don't have a mobile,

4
0:00:22.95,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so I'm on the safe side.

5
0:00:24.781,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Secondly, a political theorist

6
0:00:26.982,000 --> 0:00:28,000
who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy

7
0:00:29.447,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.

8
0:00:33.519,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.

9
0:00:36.002,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.

10
0:00:39.836,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And one of the things that I want to question

11
0:00:42.002,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is this very popular hope these days

12
0:00:44.719,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that transparency and openness

13
0:00:46.653,000 --> 0:00:5,000
can restore the trust in democratic institutions.

14
0:00:50.953,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.

15
0:00:54.669,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.

16
0:00:58.646,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.854,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.

18
0:01:05.771,000 --> 0:01:07,000
As you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.

19
0:01:08.686,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And according to the surveys,

20
0:01:10.27,000 --> 0:01:13,000
we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.

21
0:01:13.837,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:15.621,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The Economist magazine recently wrote an article

23
0:01:19.211,000 --> 0:01:21,000
covering one of the recent studies on happiness,

24
0:01:21.762,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."

25
0:01:26.596,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:28.196,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So now when you know what to expect,

27
0:01:32.043,000 --> 0:01:33,000
let's give you the story.

28
0:01:33.479,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And this is a rainy election day in a small country --

29
0:01:38.43,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that can be my country, but could be also your country.

30
0:01:41.762,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,

31
0:01:45.562,000 --> 0:01:47,000
nobody went to the polling stations.

32
0:01:48.247,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But then the rain stopped,

33
0:01:50.012,000 --> 0:01:52,000
people went to vote.

34
0:01:52.246,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And when the votes had been counted,

35
0:01:55.396,000 --> 0:02:02,000
three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.

36
0:02:02.712,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The government and the opposition,

37
0:02:05.062,000 --> 0:02:07,000
they have been simply paralyzed.

38
0:02:07.996,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Because you know what to do about the protests.

39
0:02:10.113,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.

40
0:02:12.097,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?

41
0:02:17.445,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So the government decided to have the elections once again.

42
0:02:21.778,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And this time even a greater number,

43
0:02:24.328,000 --> 0:02:29,000
83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.

44
0:02:29.511,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Basically they went to the ballot boxes

45
0:02:32.262,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to tell that they have nobody to vote for.

46
0:02:35.328,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago

47
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
called "Seeing."

48
0:02:41.843,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But in my view it very well captures

49
0:02:44.093,000 --> 0:02:48,000
part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.

50
0:02:48.477,000 --> 0:02:5,000
On one level nobody's questioning

51
0:02:51.145,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that democracy is the best form of government.

52
0:02:55.044,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Democracy is the only game in town.

53
0:02:57.78,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The problem is that many people start to believe

54
0:03:00.093,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that it is not a game worth playing.

55
0:03:02.795,000 --> 0:03:06,000
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed

56
0:03:07.093,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,

57
0:03:11.643,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the people who are least interested to vote

58
0:03:15.561,000 --> 0:03:19,000
are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.

59
0:03:20.198,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.

60
0:03:23.623,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And this is a major issue.

61
0:03:25.315,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Because especially now with the economic crisis,

62
0:03:28.046,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you can see that the trust in politics,

63
0:03:30.497,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that the trust in democratic institutions,

64
0:03:33.079,000 --> 0:03:34,000
was really destroyed.

65
0:03:34.998,000 --> 0:03:37,000
According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,

66
0:03:38.614,000 --> 0:03:42,000
89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap

67
0:03:43.496,000 --> 0:03:49,000
between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.

68
0:03:49.822,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks

69
0:03:53.83,000 --> 0:03:56,000
believe that their vote matters.

70
0:03:56.98,000 --> 0:04:,000
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,

71
0:04:01.046,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but they cannot change policies.

72
0:04:03.548,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And the question which I want to ask is the following:

73
0:04:06.164,000 --> 0:04:09,000
How did it happen that we are living in societies

74
0:04:10.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which are much freer than ever before --

75
0:04:12.63,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we have more rights, we can travel easier,

76
0:04:15.314,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we have access to more information --

77
0:04:17.663,000 --> 0:04:2,000
at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions

78
0:04:21.047,000 --> 0:04:23,000
basically has collapsed?

79
0:04:23.63,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So basically I want to ask:

80
0:04:25.066,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years

81
0:04:29.915,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when we talk about democracy?

82
0:04:31.716,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I'll start with what went right.

83
0:04:35.599,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And the first thing that went right was, of course,

84
0:04:38.661,000 --> 0:04:4,000
these five revolutions which, in my view,

85
0:04:41.132,000 --> 0:04:45,000
very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.

86
0:04:45.716,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,

87
0:04:50.941,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which put the individual at the center of politics.

88
0:04:53.756,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It was the human rights moment.

89
0:04:56.174,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,

90
0:05:00.024,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a culture of basically non-conformism,

91
0:05:03.89,000 --> 0:05:05,000
which was not known before.

92
0:05:06.191,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I do believe that even things like that

93
0:05:08.54,000 --> 0:05:11,000
are very much the children of '68 --

94
0:05:11.992,000 --> 0:05:14,000
nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.

95
0:05:15.407,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.

96
0:05:18.456,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,

97
0:05:22.09,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:

98
0:05:26.707,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"The government does not know better."

99
0:05:28.384,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And you have more choice-driven societies.

100
0:05:31.291,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And of course, you have 1989 -- the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.

101
0:05:37.858,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And it was the birth of the global world.

102
0:05:40.158,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And you have the Internet.

103
0:05:42.29,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach

104
0:05:45.257,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to what extent the Internet empowered people.

105
0:05:47.674,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It has changed the way we are communicating

106
0:05:50.507,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and basically we are viewing politics.

107
0:05:52.257,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The very idea of political community totally has changed.

108
0:05:55.275,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'm going to name one more revolution,

109
0:05:57.59,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and this is the revolution in brain sciences,

110
0:05:59.423,000 --> 0:06:,000
which totally changed the way

111
0:06:01.324,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we understand how people are making decisions.

112
0:06:04.66,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So this is what went right.

113
0:06:07.624,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But if we're going to see what went wrong,

114
0:06:09.958,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we're going to end up with the same five revolutions.

115
0:06:13.39,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,

116
0:06:16.891,000 --> 0:06:17,000
cultural and social revolution,

117
0:06:18.757,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.

118
0:06:22.324,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about --

119
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
nation, class, family.

120
0:06:29.957,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.

121
0:06:32.441,000 --> 0:06:35,000
All this was very much under attack.

122
0:06:35.79,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics

123
0:06:40.141,000 --> 0:06:42,000
when they believe that what really matters

124
0:06:42.84,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is where they personally stand.

125
0:06:45.009,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s

126
0:06:48.759,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the huge increase of inequality in societies.

127
0:06:54.72,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Remember, until the 1970s,

128
0:06:56.626,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the spread of democracy has always been accompanied

129
0:07:00.366,000 --> 0:07:03,000
by the decline of inequality.

130
0:07:03.826,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The more democratic our societies have been,

131
0:07:05.992,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the more equal they have been becoming.

132
0:07:10.025,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now we have the reverse tendency.

133
0:07:12.359,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied

134
0:07:15.059,000 --> 0:07:16,000
by the increase in inequality.

135
0:07:16.943,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And I find this very much disturbing

136
0:07:20.177,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong

137
0:07:24.125,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with democracy these days.

138
0:07:26.009,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And if you go to 1989 --

139
0:07:28.011,000 --> 0:07:31,000
something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize --

140
0:07:31.525,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War

141
0:07:35.476,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."

142
0:07:40.776,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When the Soviet Union was still there,

143
0:07:42.693,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the rich and the powerful, they needed the people,

144
0:07:46.076,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because they feared them.

145
0:07:48.359,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now the elites basically have been liberated.

146
0:07:51.66,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They're very mobile. You cannot tax them.

147
0:07:53.825,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And basically they don't fear the people.

148
0:07:56.159,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So as a result of it, you have this very strange situation

149
0:07:59.176,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.

150
0:08:03.693,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So this is not by accident

151
0:08:05.192,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that the voters are not interested to vote anymore.

152
0:08:08.178,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And when we talk about the Internet,

153
0:08:10.292,000 --> 0:08:12,000
yes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,

154
0:08:12.793,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos

155
0:08:19.476,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.

156
0:08:24.578,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And it's becoming more and more difficult

157
0:08:26.51,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to understand the people who are not like you.

158
0:08:29.276,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I know that many people here

159
0:08:31.144,000 --> 0:08:35,000
have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,

160
0:08:35.908,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?

161
0:08:39.942,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.

162
0:08:43.793,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is the other side of the things that we like.

163
0:08:46.459,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And when you go to the brain sciences,

164
0:08:48.477,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what political consultants learned from the brain scientists

165
0:08:52.843,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is don't talk to me about ideas anymore,

166
0:08:56.195,000 --> 0:08:58,000
don't talk to me about policy programs.

167
0:08:58.46,000 --> 0:09:03,000
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.

168
0:09:04.227,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And you have this very strongly

169
0:09:06.294,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,

170
0:09:10.695,000 --> 0:09:15,000
these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.

171
0:09:16.694,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Before, revolutions used to have ideological names.

172
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They could be communist, they could be liberal,

173
0:09:21.093,000 --> 0:09:22,000
they could be fascist or Islamic.

174
0:09:22.878,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.

175
0:09:27.126,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.

176
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.

177
0:09:34.66,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I'm saying this because one of my major points

178
0:09:37.195,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is what went right is also what went wrong.

179
0:09:41.994,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,

180
0:09:45.727,000 --> 0:09:47,000
when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,

181
0:09:48.676,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we should keep this ambiguity in mind.

182
0:09:51.243,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Because probably some of the things that we love most

183
0:09:54.261,000 --> 0:09:57,000
are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.

184
0:09:57.462,000 --> 0:10:,000
These days it's very popular to believe

185
0:10:00.646,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that this push for transparency,

186
0:10:02.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies

187
0:10:09.345,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and much more transparency-friendly legislation

188
0:10:13.009,000 --> 0:10:16,000
can restore trust in politics.

189
0:10:16.077,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,

190
0:10:19.76,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,

191
0:10:23.444,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it's going to be more difficult for them to steal

192
0:10:25.959,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.

193
0:10:29.644,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is probably true.

194
0:10:31.66,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But I do believe that we should be also very clear

195
0:10:34.71,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics

196
0:10:39.977,000 --> 0:10:42,000
where the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."

197
0:10:43.576,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.

198
0:10:47.159,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Transparency is politics' management of mistrust.

199
0:10:51.878,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.

200
0:10:56.41,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.

201
0:10:59.236,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is why you have checks and balances.

202
0:11:01.376,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust

203
0:11:05.527,000 --> 0:11:08,000
between the representatives and those whom they represent.

204
0:11:08.611,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But when politics is only management of mistrust,

205
0:11:13.51,000 --> 0:11:16,000
then -- I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned --

206
0:11:16.593,000 --> 0:11:19,000
now we're going to have "1984" in reverse.

207
0:11:20.343,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,

208
0:11:22.46,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it's going to be we being the Big Brother

209
0:11:24.76,000 --> 0:11:25,000
watching the political class.

210
0:11:26.51,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But is this the idea of a free society?

211
0:11:30.126,000 --> 0:11:31,000
For example, can you imagine

212
0:11:31.66,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office

213
0:11:37.778,000 --> 0:11:38,000
if they really do believe

214
0:11:39.56,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that politics is also about managing mistrust?

215
0:11:43.36,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Are you not afraid with all these technologies

216
0:11:46.394,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that are going to track down

217
0:11:48.394,000 --> 0:11:51,000
any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,

218
0:11:52.009,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians

219
0:11:55.876,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,

220
0:12:00.51,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?

221
0:12:04.527,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And the Americans who are in the room,

222
0:12:06.209,000 --> 0:12:09,000
are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern

223
0:12:09.261,000 --> 0:12:12,000
on the basis of what they said in the primary elections?

224
0:12:12.636,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I find this extremely important,

225
0:12:14.627,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because democracy is about people changing their views

226
0:12:18.659,000 --> 0:12:21,000
based on rational arguments and discussions.

227
0:12:21.809,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And we can lose this with the very noble idea

228
0:12:25.293,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to keep people accountable

229
0:12:27.309,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate

230
0:12:29.927,000 --> 0:12:31,000
politicians the opportunism in politics.

231
0:12:32.645,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So for me this is extremely important.

232
0:12:34.977,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,

233
0:12:38.243,000 --> 0:12:4,000
probably it makes sense

234
0:12:40.442,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to look also at this type of a story.

235
0:12:43.844,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.

236
0:12:47.394,000 --> 0:12:5,000
[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,

237
0:12:51.159,000 --> 0:12:53,000
they're going to be selectively transparent.

238
0:12:53.561,000 --> 0:12:55,000
In a small country that could be my country,

239
0:12:55.593,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but could be also your country,

240
0:12:57.026,000 --> 0:12:59,000
they took a decision -- it is a real case story --

241
0:12:59.211,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that all of the governmental decisions,

242
0:13:01.826,000 --> 0:13:03,000
discussions of the council of ministers,

243
0:13:04.392,000 --> 0:13:07,000
were going to be published on the Internet

244
0:13:07.693,000 --> 0:13:11,000
24 hours after the council discussions took place.

245
0:13:12.093,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And the public was extremely all for it.

246
0:13:14.261,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,

247
0:13:16.712,000 --> 0:13:17,000
why he made this decision.

248
0:13:18.31,000 --> 0:13:19,000
He said, "Listen, this is the best way

249
0:13:20.026,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to keep the mouths of my ministers closed.

250
0:13:24.654,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent

251
0:13:27.739,000 --> 0:13:29,000
knowing that 24 hours after

252
0:13:29.921,000 --> 0:13:3,000
this is going to be on the public space,

253
0:13:31.825,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."

254
0:13:35.771,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So when we talk about transparency,

255
0:13:37.238,000 --> 0:13:38,000
when we talk about openness,

256
0:13:38.837,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I really do believe that what we should keep in mind

257
0:13:40.954,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is that what went right is what went wrong.

258
0:13:44.704,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,

259
0:13:48.888,000 --> 0:13:5,000
some centuries ago he said,

260
0:13:51.37,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"There is a big shadow where there is much light."

261
0:13:54.707,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you very much.

262
0:13:56.239,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, I have a strange career.

2
0:00:17.665,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I know it because people come up to me, like colleagues, and say,

3
0:00:20.805,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"Chris, you have a strange career."

4
0:00:22.695,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:24.362,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I can see their point,

6
0:00:25.705,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions,

8
0:00:34.448,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I was only 14 years old --

9
0:00:36.853,000 --> 0:00:38,000
No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.

10
0:00:40.497,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But after that,

11
0:00:43.056,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I actually had my own lab

12
0:00:45.021,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the Computational Neuroscience department,

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I wasn't doing any neuroscience.

14
0:00:48.912,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Later, I would work on evolutionary genetics,

15
0:00:51.868,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I would work on systems biology.

16
0:00:53.842,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But I'm going to tell you about something else today.

17
0:00:56.531,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life.

18
0:01:00.817,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I was actually a rocket scientist.

19
0:01:04.322,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I wasn't really a rocket scientist,

20
0:01:06.649,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

21
0:01:11.029,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in sunny California, where it's warm;

22
0:01:13.688,000 --> 0:01:16,000
whereas now I am in the mid-West, and it's cold.

23
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But it was an exciting experience.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
One day, a NASA manager comes into my office,

25
0:01:23.727,000 --> 0:01:25,000
sits down and says,

26
0:01:26.862,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Can you please tell us, how do we look for life outside Earth?"

27
0:01:31.621,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And that came as a surprise to me,

28
0:01:33.323,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation.

29
0:01:37.473,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Yet, I had a very good answer.

30
0:01:38.998,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I said, "I have no idea."

31
0:01:40.799,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:41.973,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And he told me, "Biosignatures, we need to look for a biosignature."

33
0:01:47.339,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I said, "What is that?"

34
0:01:48.727,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And he said, "It's any measurable phenomenon

35
0:01:51.348,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that allows us to indicate the presence of life."

36
0:01:54.788,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I said, "Really?

37
0:01:56.433,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Because isn't that easy?

38
0:01:58.404,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I mean, we have life.

39
0:02:00.259,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Can't you apply a definition,

40
0:02:02.255,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for example, a Supreme Court-like definition of life?"

41
0:02:07.191,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And then I thought about it a little bit, and I said,

42
0:02:09.757,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Well, is it really that easy?

43
0:02:11.256,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Because, yes, if you see something like this,

44
0:02:13.473,000 --> 0:02:15,000
then all right, fine, I'm going to call it life --

45
0:02:15.841,000 --> 0:02:16,000
no doubt about it.

46
0:02:17.517,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But here's something."

47
0:02:19.181,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And he goes, "Right, that's life too. I know that."

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Except, if you think that life is also defined by things that die,

49
0:02:26.876,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you're not in luck with this thing,

50
0:02:28.653,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because that's actually a very strange organism.

51
0:02:30.939,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It grows up into the adult stage like that

52
0:02:33.01,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase,

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again,

54
0:02:40.219,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up --

55
0:02:43.157,000 --> 0:02:44,000
sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.

56
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So it's actually life,

57
0:02:47.21,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but it's actually not as we thought life would be.

58
0:02:51.751,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then you see something like that.

59
0:02:53.686,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And he was like, "My God, what kind of a life form is that?"

60
0:02:56.583,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Anyone know?

61
0:02:58.026,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's actually not life, it's a crystal.

62
0:03:01.542,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things --

63
0:03:04.867,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so this particular person wrote a whole article and said,

64
0:03:08.053,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"Hey, these are bacteria."

65
0:03:09.558,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Except, if you look a little bit closer,

66
0:03:11.553,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you see, in fact, that this thing is way too small to be anything like that.

67
0:03:15.213,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So he was convinced, but, in fact, most people aren't.

68
0:03:19.052,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And then, of course, NASA also had a big announcement,

69
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and President Clinton gave a press conference,

70
0:03:25.149,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite.

71
0:03:30.66,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Except that nowadays, it's heavily disputed.

72
0:03:34.066,000 --> 0:03:36,000
If you take the lesson of all these pictures,

73
0:03:36.525,000 --> 0:03:38,000
then you realize, well, actually, maybe it's not that easy.

74
0:03:39.443,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Maybe I do need a definition of life

75
0:03:42.866,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in order to make that kind of distinction.

76
0:03:45.168,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So can life be defined?

77
0:03:47.723,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well how would you go about it?

78
0:03:49.254,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Well of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.

79
0:03:53.285,000 --> 0:03:56,000
No, of course you don't do that; you put it somewhere in Google.

80
0:03:56.321,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then you might get something.

81
0:03:57.936,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:58.984,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And what you might get --

83
0:04:00.226,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to,

84
0:04:04.029,000 --> 0:04:05,000
you throw away.

85
0:04:05.275,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then you might come up with something like this.

86
0:04:07.797,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts.

87
0:04:11.078,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane?

88
0:04:18.212,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Oh, it's actually a really, really, important set of concepts.

89
0:04:22.137,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I'm highlighting just a few words

90
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and saying definitions like that rely on things

91
0:04:28.208,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to,

92
0:04:34.381,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but in fact on processes only.

93
0:04:36.156,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if you take a look at that,

94
0:04:38.051,000 --> 0:04:41,000
this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life.

95
0:04:41.532,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with.

96
0:04:45.783,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Because the idea was that, with concepts like that,

97
0:04:48.894,000 --> 0:04:52,000
maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life.

98
0:04:52.938,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And so if you go and ask yourself, "What on Earth is artificial life?",

99
0:04:57.759,000 --> 0:05:,000
let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.

100
0:05:01.452,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And it started out quite a while ago,

101
0:05:04.611,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses.

102
0:05:09.245,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And for those of you who aren't old enough,

103
0:05:11.442,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you have no idea how this infection was working --

104
0:05:14.049,000 --> 0:05:16,000
namely, through these floppy disks.

105
0:05:16.333,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections

106
0:05:20.244,000 --> 0:05:23,000
was that, if you look at the rate at which the infection worked,

107
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
they show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus.

108
0:05:27.894,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it is in fact due to this arms race

109
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
between hackers and operating system designers

110
0:05:33.74,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that things go back and forth.

111
0:05:35.364,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses,

112
0:05:39.899,000 --> 0:05:42,000
a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life

113
0:05:43.528,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that we're used to, at least on the viral level.

114
0:05:45.981,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So is that life?

115
0:05:47.526,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Not as far as I'm concerned.

116
0:05:49.166,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Why? Because these things don't evolve by themselves.

117
0:05:52.032,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In fact, they have hackers writing them.

118
0:05:54.009,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further,

119
0:05:57.363,000 --> 0:06:,000
when a scientist working at the Santa Fe Institute decided,

120
0:06:00.698,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Why don't we try to package these little viruses

121
0:06:03.855,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in artificial worlds inside of the computer

122
0:06:06.094,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and let them evolve?"

123
0:06:07.389,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And this was Steen Rasmussen.

124
0:06:09.007,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And he designed this system, but it really didn't work,

125
0:06:11.723,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because his viruses were constantly destroying each other.

126
0:06:14.631,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But there was another scientist who had been watching this, an ecologist.

127
0:06:18.172,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And he went home and says, "I know how to fix this."

128
0:06:20.688,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And he wrote the Tierra system,

129
0:06:22.356,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and, in my book,

130
0:06:23.585,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems --

131
0:06:27.433,000 --> 0:06:3,000
except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity.

132
0:06:30.919,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So having seen this work, worked a little bit on this,

133
0:06:33.807,000 --> 0:06:34,000
this is where I came in.

134
0:06:35.489,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And I decided to create a system that has all the properties

135
0:06:39.156,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that are necessary to see, in fact, the evolution of complexity,

136
0:06:43.026,000 --> 0:06:46,000
more and more complex problems constantly evolving.

137
0:06:46.352,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And of course, since I really don't know how to write code, I had help in this.

138
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I had two undergraduate students

139
0:06:51.732,000 --> 0:06:53,000
at California Institute of Technology that worked with me.

140
0:06:54.485,000 --> 0:06:56,000
That's Charles Ofria on the left, Titus Brown on the right.

141
0:06:57.361,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They are now, actually, respectable professors

142
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:,000
at Michigan State University,

143
0:07:01.486,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but I can assure you, back in the day, we were not a respectable team.

144
0:07:06.011,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And I'm really happy that no photo survives

145
0:07:08.084,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of the three of us anywhere close together.

146
0:07:11.352,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But what is this system like?

147
0:07:13.251,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Well I can't really go into the details,

148
0:07:15.464,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but what you see here is some of the entrails.

149
0:07:18.141,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure.

150
0:07:22.25,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There's about 10,000 programs sitting here.

151
0:07:24.746,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And all different strains are colored in different colors.

152
0:07:27.689,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other,

153
0:07:31.317,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because they are spreading.

154
0:07:32.682,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world,

155
0:07:36.81,000 --> 0:07:37,000
due to whatever mutation it has acquired,

156
0:07:38.802,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction.

157
0:07:42.296,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So I'm going to show you a movie

158
0:07:43.875,000 --> 0:07:45,000
where you're going to see that kind of dynamic.

159
0:07:46.126,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves.

160
0:07:50.426,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We write our own stuff, replicate it, and are very proud of ourselves.

161
0:07:53.787,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And we put them in, and what you see immediately

162
0:07:56.587,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that there are waves and waves of innovation.

163
0:07:59.677,000 --> 0:08:,000
By the way, this is highly accelerated,

164
0:08:01.595,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so it's like a 1000 generations a second.

165
0:08:03.816,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But immediately, the system goes like, "What kind of dumb piece of code was this?

166
0:08:07.807,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This can be improved upon in so many ways, so quickly."

167
0:08:11.552,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types.

168
0:08:15.324,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And this type of activity goes on for quite a while,

169
0:08:17.91,000 --> 0:08:21,000
until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs.

170
0:08:22.755,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then, you see sort of like a stasis coming on

171
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
where the system essentially waits

172
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
for a new type of innovation, like this one,

173
0:08:31.467,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before

174
0:08:35.773,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and is erasing the genes that it had before,

175
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved.

176
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And this process goes on and on and on.

177
0:08:45.727,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So what we see here

178
0:08:47.066,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is a system that lives in very much the way we're used to how life goes.

179
0:08:51.948,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But what the NASA people had asked me really was,

180
0:08:56.473,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"Do these guys have a biosignature?

181
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
Can we measure this type of life?

182
0:09:01.677,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Because if we can,

183
0:09:02.893,000 --> 0:09:05,000
maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else

184
0:09:06.766,000 --> 0:09:09,000
without being biased by things like amino acids."

185
0:09:10.481,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So I said, "Well, perhaps we should construct a biosignature

186
0:09:15.038,000 --> 0:09:18,000
based on life as a universal process.

187
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In fact, it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed

188
0:09:23.148,000 --> 0:09:27,000
just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be."

189
0:09:27.259,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the thing I came up with --

190
0:09:28.802,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I have to first give you an introduction about the idea,

191
0:09:32.808,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and maybe that would be a meaning detector,

192
0:09:36.371,000 --> 0:09:37,000
rather than a life detector.

193
0:09:38.486,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And the way we would do that --

194
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I would like to find out how I can distinguish text

195
0:09:42.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that was written by a million monkeys, as opposed to text that is in our books.

196
0:09:47.905,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And I would like to do it in such a way

197
0:09:49.806,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that I don't actually have to be able to read the language,

198
0:09:52.708,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because I'm sure I won't be able to.

199
0:09:54.502,000 --> 0:09:56,000
As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet.

200
0:09:57.026,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So here would be a frequency plot

201
0:09:59.38,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet

202
0:10:02.786,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in a text written by random monkeys.

203
0:10:05.455,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And obviously, each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent.

204
0:10:10.033,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts,

205
0:10:13.649,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it looks like that.

206
0:10:15.462,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And I'm telling you, this is very robust across English texts.

207
0:10:19.034,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And if I look at French texts, it looks a little bit different,

208
0:10:22.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or Italian or German.

209
0:10:23.244,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They all have their own type of frequency distribution,

210
0:10:26.684,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but it's robust.

211
0:10:28.141,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science.

212
0:10:31.372,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text.

213
0:10:37.176,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's a robust signature,

214
0:10:39.037,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and it's very stable.

215
0:10:40.881,000 --> 0:10:42,000
As long as our books are written in English --

216
0:10:43.062,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because people are rewriting them and recopying them --

217
0:10:45.877,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it's going to be there.

218
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea

219
0:10:53.045,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning,

220
0:10:56.824,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but rather detect the fact that there is meaning

221
0:11:00.577,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in the biomolecules that make up life.

222
0:11:03.128,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But first I have to ask:

223
0:11:04.32,000 --> 0:11:05,000
what are these building blocks,

224
0:11:05.832,000 --> 0:11:07,000
like the alphabet, elements that I showed you?

225
0:11:08.152,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Well it turns out, we have many different alternatives

226
0:11:11.049,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for such a set of building blocks.

227
0:11:13.387,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We could use amino acids,

228
0:11:14.659,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we could use nucleic acids, carboxylic acids, fatty acids.

229
0:11:17.885,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In fact, chemistry's extremely rich, and our body uses a lot of them.

230
0:11:21.347,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So that we actually, to test this idea,

231
0:11:23.677,000 --> 0:11:26,000
first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids.

232
0:11:27.248,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And here's the result.

233
0:11:28.743,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Here is, in fact, what you get

234
0:11:31.933,000 --> 0:11:34,000
if you, for example, look at the distribution of amino acids

235
0:11:34.98,000 --> 0:11:38,000
on a comet or in interstellar space or, in fact, in a laboratory,

236
0:11:39.739,000 --> 0:11:41,000
where you made very sure that in your primordial soup,

237
0:11:42.422,000 --> 0:11:43,000
there is no living stuff in there.

238
0:11:44.364,000 --> 0:11:46,000
What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine

239
0:11:47.267,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and there's some trace elements of the other ones.

240
0:11:49.65,000 --> 0:11:51,000
That is also very robust --

241
0:11:52.103,000 --> 0:11:55,000
what you find in systems like Earth

242
0:11:55.959,000 --> 0:11:58,000
where there are amino acids, but there is no life.

243
0:11:59.128,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it

244
0:12:03.782,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and then put it into these spectrometers,

245
0:12:06.766,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because there's bacteria all over the place;

246
0:12:08.888,000 --> 0:12:1,000
or you take water anywhere on Earth,

247
0:12:11.143,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because it's teaming with life,

248
0:12:12.684,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and you make the same analysis;

249
0:12:14.458,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the spectrum looks completely different.

250
0:12:17.059,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Of course, there is still glycine and alanine,

251
0:12:20.458,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but in fact, there are these heavy elements, these heavy amino acids,

252
0:12:23.802,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that are being produced because they are valuable to the organism.

253
0:12:28.327,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And some other ones that are not used in the set of 20,

254
0:12:32.289,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they will not appear at all in any type of concentration.

255
0:12:35.211,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So this also turns out to be extremely robust.

256
0:12:37.94,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up,

257
0:12:41.082,000 --> 0:12:44,000
whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals.

258
0:12:44.385,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Anywhere there's life,

259
0:12:45.833,000 --> 0:12:46,000
you're going to have this distribution,

260
0:12:47.808,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as opposed to that distribution.

261
0:12:49.649,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And it is detectable not just in amino acids.

262
0:12:52.91,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Now you could ask:

263
0:12:54.151,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Well, what about these Avidians?

264
0:12:57.334,000 --> 0:13:,000
The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world

265
0:13:00.409,000 --> 0:13:03,000
where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity.

266
0:13:03.878,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So this is the distribution that you get if, in fact, there is no life.

267
0:13:08.919,000 --> 0:13:1,000
They have about 28 of these instructions.

268
0:13:11.661,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other,

269
0:13:15.037,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter.

270
0:13:17.246,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency.

271
0:13:22.375,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But if you now take a set of replicating guys

272
0:13:27.179,000 --> 0:13:28,000
like in the video that you saw,

273
0:13:29.153,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it looks like this.

274
0:13:31.459,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So there are some instructions

275
0:13:32.956,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that are extremely valuable to these organisms,

276
0:13:35.413,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and their frequency is going to be high.

277
0:13:37.407,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And there's actually some instructions that you only use once, if ever.

278
0:13:41.472,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So they are either poisonous

279
0:13:43.019,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or really should be used at less of a level than random.

280
0:13:47.548,000 --> 0:13:49,000
In this case, the frequency is lower.

281
0:13:51.192,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And so now we can see, is that really a robust signature?

282
0:13:53.887,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I can tell you indeed it is,

283
0:13:55.268,000 --> 0:13:58,000
because this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books,

284
0:13:58.54,000 --> 0:14:,000
and just like what you've seen in amino acids,

285
0:14:00.717,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it doesn't really matter how you change the environment,

286
0:14:03.383,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it's very robust, it's going to reflect the environment.

287
0:14:06.031,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did.

288
0:14:09.004,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I have to explain to you,

289
0:14:10.412,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the top of this graph

290
0:14:11.618,000 --> 0:14:13,000
shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about.

291
0:14:14.386,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Here, that's the lifeless environment

292
0:14:18.217,000 --> 0:14:21,000
where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency.

293
0:14:22.564,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And below there, I show, in fact, the mutation rate in the environment.

294
0:14:27.581,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high

295
0:14:30.908,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that even if you would drop a replicating program

296
0:14:34.898,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world,

297
0:14:39.047,000 --> 0:14:42,000
if you drop it in, it gets mutated to death immediately.

298
0:14:42.081,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate.

299
0:14:47.451,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat, so to speak,

300
0:14:51.511,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and then there's this viability threshold

301
0:14:53.72,000 --> 0:14:56,000
where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live.

302
0:14:57.636,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And indeed, we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time.

303
0:15:03.419,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So let's see what that looks like.

304
0:15:05.079,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.

305
0:15:08.101,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Too hot, too hot.

306
0:15:09.94,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now the viability threshold is reached,

307
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed

308
0:15:16.776,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and, in fact, stabilizes.

309
0:15:18.276,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And now what I did there

310
0:15:19.81,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is, I was being nasty, I just turned up the heat again and again.

311
0:15:23.432,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And of course, it reaches the viability threshold.

312
0:15:25.802,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice.

313
0:15:28.694,000 --> 0:15:29,000
You hit the viability threshold.

314
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The distribution changes to "alive!"

315
0:15:32.691,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And then, once you hit the threshold

316
0:15:35.932,000 --> 0:15:39,000
where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self-reproduce,

317
0:15:40.005,000 --> 0:15:44,000
you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring

318
0:15:44.95,000 --> 0:15:48,000
without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes.

319
0:15:49.704,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And then, that signature is lost.

320
0:15:53.216,000 --> 0:15:54,000
What do we learn from that?

321
0:15:54.946,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Well, I think we learn a number of things from that.

322
0:15:58.766,000 --> 0:15:59,000
One of them is,

323
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
if we are able to think about life in abstract terms --

324
0:16:05.508,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and we're not talking about things like plants,

325
0:16:08.163,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and we're not talking about amino acids,

326
0:16:10.112,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and we're not talking about bacteria,

327
0:16:11.9,000 --> 0:16:13,000
but we think in terms of processes --

328
0:16:14.034,000 --> 0:16:16,000
then we could start to think about life

329
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
not as something that is so special to Earth,

330
0:16:18.903,000 --> 0:16:2,000
but that, in fact, could exist anywhere.

331
0:16:21.437,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information,

332
0:16:25.774,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of storing information within physical substrates --

333
0:16:29.856,000 --> 0:16:33,000
anything: bits, nucleic acids, anything that's an alphabet --

334
0:16:33.896,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and make sure that there's some process

335
0:16:35.799,000 --> 0:16:38,000
so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect --

336
0:16:40.076,000 --> 0:16:44,000
the time scales for the deterioration of information.

337
0:16:44.436,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And if you can do that, then you have life.

338
0:16:47.628,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So the first thing that we learn

339
0:16:49.906,000 --> 0:16:54,000
is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone,

340
0:16:55.142,000 --> 0:16:59,000
without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear,

341
0:17:00.143,000 --> 0:17:02,000
as far as the type of life on Earth is.

342
0:17:02.838,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And that, in a sense, removes us again,

343
0:17:05.503,000 --> 0:17:07,000
like all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them --

344
0:17:08.358,000 --> 0:17:1,000
it's this continuous dethroning of man --

345
0:17:11.153,000 --> 0:17:13,000
of how we think we're special because we're alive.

346
0:17:13.904,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Well, we can make life; we can make life in the computer.

347
0:17:16.984,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Granted, it's limited,

348
0:17:18.825,000 --> 0:17:23,000
but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.

349
0:17:23.966,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And once we have that,

350
0:17:26.778,000 --> 0:17:28,000
then it is not such a difficult task anymore

351
0:17:29.449,000 --> 0:17:33,000
to say, if we understand the fundamental processes

352
0:17:33.625,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that do not refer to any particular substrate,

353
0:17:36.991,000 --> 0:17:39,000
then we can go out and try other worlds,

354
0:17:40.783,000 --> 0:17:43,000
figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be,

355
0:17:45.293,000 --> 0:17:49,000
figure enough about the normal chemistry, the geochemistry of the planet,

356
0:17:50.042,000 --> 0:17:53,000
so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life,

357
0:17:53.84,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and then look for large deviations from this --

358
0:17:56.835,000 --> 0:18:01,000
this thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."

359
0:18:01.971,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Now we don't know that there's life then,

360
0:18:03.95,000 --> 0:18:04,000
but we could say,

361
0:18:05.181,000 --> 0:18:08,000
"Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical

362
0:18:08.974,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and see where it comes from."

363
0:18:11.043,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And that might be our chance of actually discovering life

364
0:18:14.778,000 --> 0:18:16,000
when we cannot visibly see it.

365
0:18:16.921,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you.

366
0:18:21.509,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be

367
0:18:25.764,000 --> 0:18:28,000
when we try to think about how it would be on other planets.

368
0:18:29.54,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And if we remove the mystery of life,

369
0:18:32.951,000 --> 0:18:36,000
then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live,

370
0:18:37.66,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.

371
0:18:40.742,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And I'm going to leave you with that.

372
0:18:43.012,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And thank you very much.

373
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Applause)

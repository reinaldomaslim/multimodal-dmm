2
0:00:12.594,000 --> 0:00:13,000
OK.

3
0:00:14.024,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So we are going to start in 1891,

4
0:00:17.27,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when a German scientist was looking through a microscope

5
0:00:20.619,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at insect cells.

6
0:00:22.228,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And he saw something kind of funny.

7
0:00:24.348,000 --> 0:00:27,000
At the center of the cells, there was this dark stuff.

8
0:00:28.133,000 --> 0:00:29,000
No one had ever seen it before.

9
0:00:29.927,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And he noticed that as the cells would multiply and divide,

10
0:00:33.625,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it would go into some of the new cells

11
0:00:36.069,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but not the others.

12
0:00:37.371,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He didn't know what it was, so he gave it a really great name.

13
0:00:40.355,000 --> 0:00:41,000
He called it the "X element."

14
0:00:42.356,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:43.57,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And he was like, "We'll just fill in that X later."

16
0:00:46.927,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And then, fast-forward 10 years later,

17
0:00:50.094,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and there is an American scientist,

18
0:00:52.117,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and she is looking through her microscope,

19
0:00:54.522,000 --> 0:00:55,000
also at insect cells.

20
0:00:56.887,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And she sees something funny.

21
0:00:58.307,000 --> 0:01:,000
There's more of this dark stuff.

22
0:01:00.453,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And it's kind of tiny,

23
0:01:01.633,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's hanging out near the X element.

24
0:01:04.569,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And eventually, someone was like,

25
0:01:06.165,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Well, if that one thing's called X,

26
0:01:07.923,000 --> 0:01:09,000
should we call this other thing Y?"

27
0:01:10.145,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And like that, (Snaps fingers)

28
0:01:11.708,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the sex chromosomes had been discovered.

29
0:01:14.312,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So chromosomes,

30
0:01:15.994,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you probably all know what they are,

31
0:01:17.748,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but I will tell you anyways.

32
0:01:19.122,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They're made up of DNA --

33
0:01:20.633,000 --> 0:01:22,000
everything has it, it's the blueprint of life,

34
0:01:23.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we've got rats, we've got trees,

35
0:01:24.704,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we've got insects, we've got humans.

36
0:01:27.1,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And in the case of human chromosomes,

37
0:01:30.311,000 --> 0:01:33,000
geneticist Melissa Wilson broke it down for me like this.

38
0:01:34.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Audio) Melissa Wilson: Typically, you'll get one copy of every chromosome

39
0:01:37.676,000 --> 0:01:38,000
from your genetic mom

40
0:01:38.958,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and one copy of every chromosome from your genetic dad,

41
0:01:41.621,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and we have 22 of these

42
0:01:43.75,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that you get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.

43
0:01:46.267,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then there's a 23rd pair, X and Y.

44
0:01:50.345,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Molly Webster: So while all the other chromosomes are numbered,

45
0:01:53.561,000 --> 0:01:54,000
one through 22,

46
0:01:55.378,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we do not call X and Y 23.

47
0:01:58.513,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I like to think that they are waiting for, like, a LeBron James to come along.

48
0:02:02.204,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But in this instance, they were like,

49
0:02:04.586,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"We're just going to keep the letters,

50
0:02:06.736,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then we'll give them a title."

51
0:02:08.926,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They called them the sex chromosomes.

52
0:02:10.942,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now I would wager that in the United States,

53
0:02:13.395,000 --> 0:02:15,000
these are the most well-known chromosomes

54
0:02:16.077,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for one simple fact:

55
0:02:17.672,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that we say X equals "girl," and Y equals "boy" --

56
0:02:20.958,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that they are responsible for sex.

57
0:02:23.442,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And -- and I had to learn this --

58
0:02:25.046,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but when I'm talking about "sex" here,

59
0:02:27.53,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm talking about the way biology gives us gonads,

60
0:02:30.712,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which are our ovaries and our testes --

61
0:02:32.673,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm not talking about gender, which is how we identify.

62
0:02:35.871,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And so, as a reporter at the show --

63
0:02:38.704,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Radiolab," the audio documentary program I work for --

64
0:02:43.117,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was like, what's up with these sex chromosomes?

65
0:02:46.561,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You know, that's kind of my job, I think things are weird,

66
0:02:49.324,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and then I get to call people about them

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and ask questions, and then hopefully they answer.

68
0:02:53.685,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And in this case, a lot of people answered.

69
0:02:55.709,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And in the two years I had of reporting on X and Y,

70
0:02:59.261,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as part of "Gonads," the series on sex and gender

71
0:03:01.903,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I ended up doing for "Radiolab,"

72
0:03:03.887,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I found out that these two chromosomes live in a world that is unexpected,

73
0:03:09.069,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a little unsettling;

74
0:03:10.902,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where things that I thought were facts

75
0:03:12.782,000 --> 0:03:14,000
were, like, twisted in ways I hadn't seen before.

76
0:03:15.878,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And the world goes so far beyond the boundaries of sex,

77
0:03:20.248,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was like,

78
0:03:21.525,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Maybe we should all talk about this."

79
0:03:23.748,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, you're you all,

80
0:03:25.891,000 --> 0:03:27,000
we're all going to talk about it.

81
0:03:28.724,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And for me,

82
0:03:30.204,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the true story of X and Y starts with their name.

83
0:03:34.498,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So within years of being discovered,

84
0:03:37.069,000 --> 0:03:41,000
these two little chromosomes had acquired more than 10 different names.

85
0:03:41.411,000 --> 0:03:44,000
There was diplosome and heterochromosome

86
0:03:44.673,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and idiochromosome,

87
0:03:46.117,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and most of the names had to do with their structure, their shape,

88
0:03:49.792,000 --> 0:03:5,000
their size.

89
0:03:51.196,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then there was "sex chromosome,"

90
0:03:53.22,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which they had been given because of the fact

91
0:03:55.371,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we had started seeing that the X would go with the females,

92
0:03:58.427,000 --> 0:04:,000
and the Y would often go with the males.

93
0:04:01.498,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But scientists were like,

94
0:04:03.942,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Do we really want to call them sex chromosomes?"

95
0:04:06.784,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And science historian Sarah Richardson is the one who told me this story.

96
0:04:11.823,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Audio) Sarah Richardson: For three decades, scientists were like,

97
0:04:14.991,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"You should not call them the sex chromosomes.

98
0:04:17.204,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The X and Y have many functions,

99
0:04:19.784,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and you wouldn't assume that a single chromosome

100
0:04:23.871,000 --> 0:04:24,000
controls a single trait.

101
0:04:25.664,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Imagine calling one chromosome the 'urogenital chromosome,'

102
0:04:29.929,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or the 'liver chromosome.'"

103
0:04:33.118,000 --> 0:04:35,000
MW: Scientists, if you dig into the history --

104
0:04:35.547,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it's really cool, you should --

105
0:04:37.079,000 --> 0:04:41,000
were hesitant to, like, commit to such a specific name

106
0:04:42.02,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and such a powerfully connotated name.

107
0:04:44.623,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There was a fear that it would actually be really limiting --

108
0:04:47.505,000 --> 0:04:49,000
maybe to science, maybe to society --

109
0:04:49.639,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but the fear was in the room.

110
0:04:52.22,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And you can see they ended up getting "sex chromosome" --

111
0:04:56.228,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it's like a pretty juicy title,

112
0:04:58.855,000 --> 0:05:,000
it popularized genetics, you know?

113
0:05:01.657,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But in the 100-year history since we settled on that name,

114
0:05:07.899,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you can see it starts to get a little complicated.

115
0:05:11.01,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So around 1960 --

116
0:05:13.032,000 --> 0:05:15,000
this is going to be our first stop

117
0:05:15.232,000 --> 0:05:17,000
on the complicated world of the sex chromosomes --

118
0:05:17.625,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so around 1960,

119
0:05:19.279,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we had discovered that you could be XYY.

120
0:05:22.466,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They discovered an XYY man.

121
0:05:25.07,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And to digress a little here,

122
0:05:27.927,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it turns out that the model of "X equals girl and Y equals boy"

123
0:05:32.617,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is really simplistic.

124
0:05:34.348,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You can actually be a whole bunch of different combinations of X and Y,

125
0:05:38.8,000 --> 0:05:41,000
giving you, like, different types of biological sex.

126
0:05:42.243,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You could be two Xs and two Ys together.

127
0:05:44.498,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You could be four Xs, you could be five Xs,

128
0:05:46.538,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you could be XO.

129
0:05:47.871,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so I thought that was pretty crazy,

130
0:05:50.482,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because I was like,

131
0:05:51.689,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Wow, this really upends a model of biological sex

132
0:05:54.047,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I think most of us in this room have been taught."

133
0:05:56.815,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So a few years after they realized that you can be XYY,

134
0:06:00.155,000 --> 0:06:02,000
researchers go to a prison in Scotland,

135
0:06:02.79,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and they do genetic analysis of a bunch of the male prisoners.

136
0:06:06.854,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And they find a number of people who are XYY.

137
0:06:10.577,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And according to Sarah:

138
0:06:13.093,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Audio) SR: They just rushed to publish a theory

139
0:06:15.895,000 --> 0:06:18,000
suggesting that this extra Y chromosome

140
0:06:19.449,000 --> 0:06:22,000
could explain criminality in some men.

141
0:06:23.774,000 --> 0:06:24,000
MW: Yeah.

142
0:06:24.958,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So the logic goes like this:

143
0:06:26.568,000 --> 0:06:28,000
By this point, we're thinking Y is male.

144
0:06:29.601,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We think male is aggressive,

145
0:06:31.926,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so Y must be aggression.

146
0:06:33.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
If you've got an extra Y, you must be crazy.

147
0:06:37.069,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And like, we went nuts with this theory.

148
0:06:39.356,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We called it the supermale,

149
0:06:41.689,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they started scanning more prisoners,

150
0:06:43.987,000 --> 0:06:46,000
serial killers, boys.

151
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And in all seriousness,

152
0:06:48.651,000 --> 0:06:52,000
there was actually a suggestion that we consider aborting XYY fetuses.

153
0:06:55.572,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So in 1980,

154
0:06:57.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
this theory pretty much toppled, for a number of reasons.

155
0:07:00.787,000 --> 0:07:01,000
One,

156
0:07:02.506,000 --> 0:07:03,000
there had been this really large study

157
0:07:04.347,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that basically showed there was no connection

158
0:07:06.498,000 --> 0:07:08,000
between Y and violence,

159
0:07:08.569,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I think we all saw that coming.

160
0:07:10.633,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And then, there was one other thing.

161
0:07:13.799,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Audio) SR: Going back and looking at those original findings

162
0:07:16.697,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in that high-security psychiatric institution,

163
0:07:18.918,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they had also found a high number of individuals

164
0:07:23.647,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with an extra X chromosome.

165
0:07:25.989,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY.

166
0:07:29.534,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Audio) MW: Really?

167
0:07:30.709,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Audio) SR: Yeah. Now, they never claimed

168
0:07:32.674,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that the individuals with an extra X chromosome

169
0:07:34.887,000 --> 0:07:35,000
were superfemales.

170
0:07:36.458,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They never investigated whether they had higher rates of violence.

171
0:07:41.34,000 --> 0:07:42,000
MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.

172
0:07:43.092,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I don't know.

173
0:07:44.276,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But I think it's interesting,

174
0:07:46.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
because what you see is if you start looking at these chromosomes

175
0:07:51.133,000 --> 0:07:52,000
through the lens of sex,

176
0:07:52.466,000 --> 0:07:54,000
what naturally falls in place behind

177
0:07:54.643,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is we look at them through the lens of gender,

178
0:07:57.196,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the traits that we associate with gender.

179
0:07:59.339,000 --> 0:08:,000
So men were violent,

180
0:08:00.855,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and Y explained why they were in prison.

181
0:08:03.141,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The X did not do that,

182
0:08:04.586,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because like, you know, what's X?

183
0:08:06.482,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We don't associate it with violence.

184
0:08:08.792,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And while we don't believe in supermales today --

185
0:08:12.149,000 --> 0:08:13,000
God, I hope we don't --

186
0:08:13.347,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we don't believe in supermales today,

187
0:08:15.205,000 --> 0:08:18,000
there is a very similar conversation that's still happening

188
0:08:18.569,000 --> 0:08:21,000
around inherent violence in boys and biology.

189
0:08:24.045,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So my next stop on the weird world of X and Y,

190
0:08:27.664,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or things feeling a little topsy-turvy, is 1985.

191
0:08:31.616,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The World University Games were set to happen in Japan,

192
0:08:35.315,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and the Spanish hurdler María José Martínez-Patiño was scheduled to run.

193
0:08:41.556,000 --> 0:08:43,000
She was like a hot shot, a rising superstar.

194
0:08:45.112,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the night before her race, they had her DNA scanned.

195
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now at the time, this was a thing that they were doing,

196
0:08:52.014,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because they were like,

197
0:08:53.188,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"OK, we don't want men covertly racing as women,

198
0:08:57.117,000 --> 0:08:59,000
so we're going to scan the women

199
0:08:59.744,000 --> 0:09:,000
and make sure all their Xs line up."

200
0:09:03.165,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And so I heard this story from Ruth Padawer

201
0:09:06.347,000 --> 0:09:08,000
who was a New York Times Magazine reporter

202
0:09:08.8,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and she reported on María.

203
0:09:12.013,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Audio) Ruth Padawer: So they tell her the chromosome test results were abnormal.

204
0:09:15.934,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Although on the outside, she was fully female,

205
0:09:18.18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
she had XY chromosomes and these internal testes.

206
0:09:22.236,000 --> 0:09:23,000
MW: They were like,

207
0:09:23.411,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"We hate to break it to you, María, but you're actually a dude.

208
0:09:26.419,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You can't race with the ladies."

209
0:09:30.497,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Audio) RP: And so she's thrown off the national team,

210
0:09:33.053,000 --> 0:09:35,000
she's expelled from the athletics residence,

211
0:09:36.038,000 --> 0:09:37,000
she's denied her scholarship,

212
0:09:37.752,000 --> 0:09:38,000
a bunch of her friends dump her,

213
0:09:39.482,000 --> 0:09:41,000
fellow athletes abandon her,

214
0:09:41.636,000 --> 0:09:44,000
she loses her medals, her records are revoked.

215
0:09:46.784,000 --> 0:09:47,000
MW: So it turns out --

216
0:09:48.069,000 --> 0:09:49,000
remember when I told you

217
0:09:49.284,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you can be a bunch of different combinations of X and Y --

218
0:09:52.025,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you can also be XY and be female.

219
0:09:54.378,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You can be XX and male.

220
0:09:56.577,000 --> 0:09:59,000
In María's case, she was something called androgen insensitive.

221
0:10:00.371,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Which means that she did have some sort of internal testes --

222
0:10:04.323,000 --> 0:10:06,000
they were making testosterone --

223
0:10:06.514,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but her body couldn't use it.

224
0:10:08.752,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And so if you thought of testosterone as, like, a superpower,

225
0:10:11.911,000 --> 0:10:13,000
she was not benefiting from it.

226
0:10:14.038,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And so eventually,

227
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
sports authorities, like, let her back in,

228
0:10:17.879,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but her career was done.

229
0:10:20.498,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And in this instance you see how,

230
0:10:24.283,000 --> 0:10:27,000
if you assign sex to a specific place in the body,

231
0:10:27.95,000 --> 0:10:29,000
or at least, like, this is what I saw, right?

232
0:10:30.474,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If you assign sex to a specific place in the body,

233
0:10:34.117,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it somehow makes us think that we can go into a body,

234
0:10:37.434,000 --> 0:10:38,000
look at a specific place

235
0:10:39.061,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and tell someone we know something more about them

236
0:10:41.705,000 --> 0:10:43,000
than they know about themselves.

237
0:10:44.188,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And that feels terrifying to me.

238
0:10:48.188,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And we don't genetically test female athletes anymore,

239
0:10:51.902,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but you can see very similar conversations happening

240
0:10:55.161,000 --> 0:10:57,000
when we talk about testosterone in sports,

241
0:10:57.704,000 --> 0:11:,000
you can also see it in suggestions that we take transgender individuals

242
0:11:01.649,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and we genetically analyze them and we tell them who they are.

243
0:11:06.238,000 --> 0:11:07,000
That is real,

244
0:11:07.46,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that is a conversation that has happened recently.

245
0:11:11.944,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The last place that I'll share with you

246
0:11:13.881,000 --> 0:11:15,000
where these chromosomes got complicated for me

247
0:11:16.117,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is this one thing that Melissa told me.

248
0:11:18.832,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Audio) Wilson: You can't survive without an X chromosome.

249
0:11:21.591,000 --> 0:11:23,000
No matter your gonads, no matter your identity,

250
0:11:23.807,000 --> 0:11:25,000
every single human being has to have an X chromosome,

251
0:11:26.339,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because without one, the rest of your body doesn't develop.

252
0:11:29.134,000 --> 0:11:31,000
MW: Why do we call this the female chromosome?

253
0:11:31.326,000 --> 0:11:33,000
OK, this is something I had never though about,

254
0:11:33.58,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but literally, every single person in this audience has an X chromosome,

255
0:11:37.024,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm not lying.

256
0:11:38.199,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Every single person on the planet has an X chromosome,

257
0:11:40.761,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but no one is going around like, "This is the every-person chromosome."

258
0:11:44.142,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You know?

259
0:11:45.341,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Like, somehow it's over here, the Y is over there,

260
0:11:47.75,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and they must be really different,

261
0:11:49.408,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and I'm just like, it would be so much better

262
0:11:51.535,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if it was the every-person chromosome.

263
0:11:53.387,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And not just because I'm like, love you all and I want you all in,

264
0:11:56.871,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but because of what we're overlooking by the fact that we consider it female.

265
0:12:02.198,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Because I'm going to tell you one of the craziest things I found out.

266
0:12:05.983,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Which is, when you think about the X chromosome,

267
0:12:09.293,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of the almost 1,100 genes on the X chromosome,

268
0:12:12.584,000 --> 0:12:15,000
how many do you think have to do with sex and reproduction?

269
0:12:15.609,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Like, get a number in your head.

270
0:12:19.347,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Four percent.

271
0:12:21.736,000 --> 0:12:24,000
That means 96 percent of the rest of that chromosome

272
0:12:24.784,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is doing something that has nothing to do with your gonads.

273
0:12:28.466,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I guess as all of these,

274
0:12:30.942,000 --> 0:12:31,000
sort of, some of them social stories,

275
0:12:32.752,000 --> 0:12:34,000
some of them scientific stories, some of these facts,

276
0:12:35.609,000 --> 0:12:38,000
started to add up, I just thought, like,

277
0:12:38.873,000 --> 0:12:4,000
why are we calling these the sex chromosomes?

278
0:12:41.159,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Or if we are, like, maybe we all like that name,

279
0:12:44.016,000 --> 0:12:47,000
should we just allow ourselves to think about them

280
0:12:48.031,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a little more broadly?

281
0:12:49.43,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because if we do,

282
0:12:50.748,000 --> 0:12:54,000
like, what insights would we gain, as people, as scientists?

283
0:12:55.645,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And we're at this point where we're thinking about, like,

284
0:12:58.343,000 --> 0:12:59,000
how do we want to teach science,

285
0:12:59.923,000 --> 0:13:,000
what do we want to fund,

286
0:13:01.117,000 --> 0:13:03,000
like, who do we want to be as a society, you know?

287
0:13:03.483,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I just wondered if it wasn't a moment to rethink the biology of X and Y,

288
0:13:08.942,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and at the very least,

289
0:13:11.141,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to remember, like, the footnotes of history,

290
0:13:13.538,000 --> 0:13:18,000
which is that the dude who came up with the phrase "sex chromosome,"

291
0:13:18.942,000 --> 0:13:21,000
actually was like, "Hey, everyone, just remember, this is just,"

292
0:13:22.569,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and I quote, "a form of shorthand."

293
0:13:25.887,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We should not take it literally.

294
0:13:28.641,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you.

295
0:13:29.823,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

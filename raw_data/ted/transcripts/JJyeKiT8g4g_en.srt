1
0:00:12.996,000 --> 0:00:14,000
OK, I have a question for all of us.

2
0:00:15.104,000 --> 0:00:16,000
You ready?

3
0:00:17.05,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Is all winning success?

4
0:00:19.27,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Murmurs)

5
0:00:20.683,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Oh.

6
0:00:22.405,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:24.229,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Whoa. OK.

8
0:00:26.541,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I am the recently retired head coach

9
0:00:29.123,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of the UCLA Women's Gymnastics Team,

10
0:00:31.901,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a position that I held for 29 years.

11
0:00:34.239,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Applause)

12
0:00:35.845,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Thank you.

13
0:00:37.021,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And during my tenure,

14
0:00:39.249,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I experienced a lot of winning.

15
0:00:41.48,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I led our team to seven National Championships,

16
0:00:44.258,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame

17
0:00:47.41,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I was even voted the Coach of the Century

18
0:00:50.145,000 --> 0:00:51,000
by the Pac-12 Conference.

19
0:00:51.628,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Applause)

20
0:00:54.01,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Winning is really, really,

21
0:00:57.738,000 --> 0:00:59,000
like, really, really fun.

22
0:00:59.817,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:02.099,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But I am here to share my insight:

24
0:01:04.659,000 --> 0:01:06,000
winning does not always equal success.

25
0:01:07.756,000 --> 0:01:09,000
All across America and around the world,

26
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we have a crisis

27
0:01:12.81,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the win-at-all-cost cultures

28
0:01:15.506,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that we have created.

29
0:01:18.272,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In our schools,

30
0:01:19.744,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in our businesses, in politics,

31
0:01:22.486,000 --> 0:01:24,000
winning at all cost has become acceptable.

32
0:01:27.01,000 --> 0:01:28,000
As a society,

33
0:01:28.931,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we honor the people at the top of the pyramid.

34
0:01:31.687,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We effusively applaud those people who win championships and elections and awards.

35
0:01:39.276,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But sadly, quite often,

36
0:01:41.267,000 --> 0:01:44,000
those same people are leaving their institutions

37
0:01:44.979,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as damaged human beings.

38
0:01:48.306,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Sadly, with straight A's,

39
0:01:50.409,000 --> 0:01:52,000
kids are leaving school damaged.

40
0:01:54.286,000 --> 0:01:55,000
With awards and medals,

41
0:01:55.651,000 --> 0:02:01,000
athletes often leave their teams damaged,

42
0:02:01.705,000 --> 0:02:03,000
emotionally, mentally, not just physically.

43
0:02:04.993,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And with huge profits, employees often leave their companies damaged.

44
0:02:10.812,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We have become so hyperfocused on that end result,

45
0:02:15.497,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and when the end result is a win,

46
0:02:19.51,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the human component of how we got there

47
0:02:22.424,000 --> 0:02:25,000
often gets swept under the proverbial rug,

48
0:02:25.667,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and so does the damage.

49
0:02:28.647,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I'm calling for a time-out.

50
0:02:30.991,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Time-out.

51
0:02:32.879,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We need to redefine success.

52
0:02:35.968,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Real success is developing champions in life for our world,

53
0:02:42.804,000 --> 0:02:44,000
win or lose.

54
0:02:47.073,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Applause)

55
0:02:52.105,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Real success is developing champions in life,

56
0:02:55.561,000 --> 0:02:56,000
not for your team,

57
0:02:57.064,000 --> 0:02:59,000
not for your business

58
0:02:59.455,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and, I'm sad to tell you, not even for your Christmas card bragging rights.

59
0:03:04.369,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Sorry.

60
0:03:05.882,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So how do we do this?

61
0:03:07.979,000 --> 0:03:11,000
First of all, you may be able to dictate your way to a win,

62
0:03:12.484,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but you can't dictate your way to success.

63
0:03:16.781,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Let me take you back to 1990, when I was first appointed the head coach

64
0:03:20.549,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of the UCLA Women's Gymnastics Team.

65
0:03:23.266,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I would like to share with you that I've never done gymnastics.

66
0:03:27.196,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I grew up in the world of ballet.

67
0:03:29.196,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I have never done a cartwheel,

68
0:03:32.062,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I couldn't teach you how to do a proper cartwheel.

69
0:03:34.977,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:36.046,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's sadly true.

71
0:03:37.359,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I knew nothing about how to develop a team culture.

72
0:03:43.283,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The best I could do was mimic other coaches who had won.

73
0:03:47.728,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so I became tough-talking,

74
0:03:49.834,000 --> 0:03:51,000
tough-minded, relentless,

75
0:03:53.219,000 --> 0:03:54,000
unsympathetic,

76
0:03:54.938,000 --> 0:03:56,000
bullish, unempathetic

77
0:03:58.487,000 --> 0:04:,000
and oftentimes downright mean.

78
0:04:02.345,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I acted like a head coach

79
0:04:05.67,000 --> 0:04:08,000
whose only thought was to figure out how to win.

80
0:04:11.553,000 --> 0:04:12,000
My first few seasons as a head coach

81
0:04:13.445,000 --> 0:04:14,000
were abysmal,

82
0:04:14.894,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and after putting up with my brash coaching style for a few years,

83
0:04:18.876,000 --> 0:04:2,000
our team asked me for a team meeting.

84
0:04:21.248,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Well, I love team meetings,

85
0:04:22.589,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so I said, "Yay! Let's have a team meeting."

86
0:04:25.352,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And for two solid hours,

87
0:04:27.889,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they gave me examples of how my arrogance was hurtful and demeaning.

88
0:04:34.603,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Yeah, not yay.

89
0:04:37.501,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They explained to me

90
0:04:39.2,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that they wanted to be supported,

91
0:04:41.316,000 --> 0:04:42,000
not belittled.

92
0:04:42.768,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They wanted to be coached up, not torn down.

93
0:04:45.401,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They wanted to be motivated,

94
0:04:48.007,000 --> 0:04:5,000
not pressured or bullied.

95
0:04:51.476,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That was my time-out,

96
0:04:54.242,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I chose to change.

97
0:04:57.689,000 --> 0:05:,000
Being a dogmatic dictator

98
0:05:00.972,000 --> 0:05:03,000
may produce compliant, good little soldiers,

99
0:05:04.549,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but it doesn't develop champions in life.

100
0:05:08.278,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It is so much easier, in any walk of life,

101
0:05:12.467,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to dictate and give orders

102
0:05:14.952,000 --> 0:05:17,000
than to actually figure out how to motivate someone

103
0:05:19.015,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to want to be better.

104
0:05:20.808,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And the reason is -- we all know this --

105
0:05:23.048,000 --> 0:05:25,000
motivation takes a really long time

106
0:05:25.751,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to take root.

107
0:05:27.592,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But when it does,

108
0:05:29.838,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it is character-building

109
0:05:31.893,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and life-altering.

110
0:05:34.464,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I realized that I needed to fortify our student-athletes

111
0:05:39.151,000 --> 0:05:41,000
as whole human beings,

112
0:05:42.119,000 --> 0:05:43,000
not just athletes who won.

113
0:05:44.355,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So success for me shifted

114
0:05:46.935,000 --> 0:05:48,000
from only focusing on winning

115
0:05:49.507,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to developing my coaching philosophy,

116
0:05:52.218,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which is developing champions in life through sport.

117
0:05:57.869,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I knew if I did this well enough,

118
0:05:59.886,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that champion mentality would translate to the competition floor.

119
0:06:04.23,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And it did.

120
0:06:06.343,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The key ingredient was to develop trust

121
0:06:10.439,000 --> 0:06:11,000
through patience,

122
0:06:12.515,000 --> 0:06:13,000
respectful honesty

123
0:06:15.555,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and accountability --

124
0:06:18.186,000 --> 0:06:2,000
all of the ingredients that go into tough love.

125
0:06:22.82,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Speaking of tough love,

126
0:06:24.777,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Katelyn Ohashi is a perfect example of this.

127
0:06:27.678,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You may have all seen her floor routine.

128
0:06:30.253,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It has had over 150 million views.

129
0:06:34.785,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And the consensus is, her performance is pure joy.

130
0:06:39.434,000 --> 0:06:44,000
However, when Katelyn came to UCLA, she was broken in body, mind and spirit.

131
0:06:45.691,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She had grown up in a stereotypical, very high-level athletic world,

132
0:06:52.054,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and she was damaged.

133
0:06:54.641,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So when Katelyn came to UCLA her freshman year,

134
0:06:57.715,000 --> 0:07:,000
she found her inner rebel quite well,

135
0:07:02.085,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the point where she was no longer able to do gymnastics

136
0:07:04.933,000 --> 0:07:05,000
at the level at which she was recruited.

137
0:07:07.427,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And I will never forget

138
0:07:09.542,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a team meeting we had halfway through her freshman season.

139
0:07:12.833,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We were in there with the team, the coaching staff, the support staff,

140
0:07:16.17,000 --> 0:07:17,000
sports psychologist,

141
0:07:17.725,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and Katelyn very clearly and unapologetically said,

142
0:07:24.212,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"I just don't want to be great again."

143
0:07:28.52,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I felt like I got sucker punched.

144
0:07:31.813,000 --> 0:07:33,000
My first thought was,

145
0:07:34.218,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Then why the heck am I going to honor your scholarship?"

146
0:07:39.39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It was a really snarky thought, and thankfully I didn't say it out loud,

147
0:07:42.885,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because then I had clarity.

148
0:07:46.45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Katelyn didn't hate gymnastics.

149
0:07:49.355,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Katelyn hated everything associated with being great.

150
0:07:53.485,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Katelyn didn't want to be a winner,

151
0:07:55.935,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because winning at all cost had cost her her joy.

152
0:08:01.795,000 --> 0:08:05,000
My job was to figure out how to motivate her

153
0:08:05.853,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to want to be great again,

154
0:08:08.74,000 --> 0:08:11,000
by helping her redefine success.

155
0:08:14.601,000 --> 0:08:17,000
My enthusiasm for that challenge turned into determination

156
0:08:18.491,000 --> 0:08:21,000
when one day Katelyn looked me in the eye and said,

157
0:08:21.558,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"Ms. Val, I just want you to know,

158
0:08:23.903,000 --> 0:08:25,000
everything you tell me to do, I do the exact opposite."

159
0:08:26.895,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:29.583,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Yeah, it was like, yeah, Katelyn, challenge accepted. OK.

161
0:08:32.817,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:34.985,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And further proof that dictating was not going to win.

163
0:08:39.111,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So I embarked on the painfully slow process

164
0:08:42.402,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of building trust

165
0:08:44.147,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and proving to her that first and foremost

166
0:08:46.768,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I cared about her as a whole human being.

167
0:08:52.931,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Part of my strategy was to only talk to Katelyn about gymnastics in the gym.

168
0:08:57.955,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Outside of the gym, we talked about everything else:

169
0:09:00.459,000 --> 0:09:02,000
school, boys, families, friends, hobbies.

170
0:09:03.008,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I encouraged her to find things outside of her sport that brought her joy.

171
0:09:08.197,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it was so cool

172
0:09:11.01,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to see the process of Katelyn Ohashi literally blossom before our eyes.

173
0:09:17.507,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And through that process,

174
0:09:20.355,000 --> 0:09:23,000
she rediscovered her self-love

175
0:09:23.61,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and self-worth.

176
0:09:26.702,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And slowly, she was able to bring that joy

177
0:09:31.425,000 --> 0:09:32,000
back to her gymnastics.

178
0:09:34.506,000 --> 0:09:38,000
She went on to earn the NCAA title on floor,

179
0:09:38.853,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and she helped our team win our seventh NCAA championship in 2018.

180
0:09:44.675,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So --

181
0:09:45.805,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you.

182
0:09:46.765,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

183
0:09:50.679,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So let's think about the Katelyn Ohashis in your life.

184
0:09:55.294,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Let's think about those people under your care and your guidance.

185
0:10:00.124,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What are you telling your kids on the car ride home?

186
0:10:05.431,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That car ride home

187
0:10:06.812,000 --> 0:10:09,000
has much more impact than you know.

188
0:10:12.182,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Are you focusing on the end result,

189
0:10:14.929,000 --> 0:10:15,000
or are you excited to use that time

190
0:10:16.665,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to help your child develop into a champion?

191
0:10:19.771,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's very simple:

192
0:10:21.01,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you will know you're focusing on the end result

193
0:10:23.386,000 --> 0:10:25,000
if you ask questions about the end result.

194
0:10:26.234,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Did you win?"

195
0:10:28.14,000 --> 0:10:29,000
"How many points did you score?"

196
0:10:30.404,000 --> 0:10:31,000
"Did you get an A?"

197
0:10:33.89,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If you truly are motivated about helping your child develop into a champion,

198
0:10:39.634,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you will ask questions about the experience

199
0:10:42.73,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and the process,

200
0:10:44.071,000 --> 0:10:46,000
like, "What did you learn today?"

201
0:10:47.072,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"Did you help a teammate?"

202
0:10:49.523,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And, my favorite question,

203
0:10:51.533,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"Did you figure out how to have fun at working really, really hard?"

204
0:10:57.021,000 --> 0:11:,000
And then the key is to be very still

205
0:11:00.611,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and listen to their response.

206
0:11:04.501,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I believe that one of the greatest gifts we can give another human being

207
0:11:09.109,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is to silence our minds

208
0:11:11.614,000 --> 0:11:13,000
from the need to be right

209
0:11:14.148,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or the need to formulate the appropriate response

210
0:11:17.169,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and truly listen

211
0:11:18.764,000 --> 0:11:19,000
when someone else is talking.

212
0:11:21.518,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And in silencing our minds,

213
0:11:24.371,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we actually hear our own fears and inadequacies,

214
0:11:28.682,000 --> 0:11:31,000
which can help us formulate our response

215
0:11:32.18,000 --> 0:11:35,000
with more clarity and empathy.

216
0:11:38.216,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Kyla Ross, another one of our gymnasts,

217
0:11:40.13,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is one of the greatest gymnasts in the history of the sport.

218
0:11:42.992,000 --> 0:11:44,000
She's the only athlete to have earned the trifecta:

219
0:11:46.362,000 --> 0:11:47,000
she's a national champion,

220
0:11:48.385,000 --> 0:11:49,000
a world champion

221
0:11:50.002,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and an Olympic champion.

222
0:11:52.465,000 --> 0:11:54,000
She's also not one for small talk,

223
0:11:54.863,000 --> 0:11:56,000
so I was a bit surprised one day when she came to my office,

224
0:11:57.756,000 --> 0:11:58,000
sat on the couch

225
0:11:59.105,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and just started talking --

226
0:12:01.445,000 --> 0:12:02,000
first about her major,

227
0:12:03.167,000 --> 0:12:04,000
then about graduate school

228
0:12:04.756,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and then about everything else that seemed to pop into her mind.

229
0:12:09.186,000 --> 0:12:12,000
My inner voice whispered to me

230
0:12:12.585,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that something was on her mind,

231
0:12:14.668,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and if I was still

232
0:12:16.742,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and gave her enough time,

233
0:12:19.192,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it would come out.

234
0:12:22.097,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And it did.

235
0:12:24.885,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It was the first time that Kyla had shared with anyone

236
0:12:29.739,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that she had been sexually abused by Larry Nassar,

237
0:12:34.095,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the former USA Gymnastics team doctor,

238
0:12:36.548,000 --> 0:12:4,000
who was later convicted of being a serial child molester.

239
0:12:43.755,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Kyla came forward

240
0:12:45.815,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and joined the army

241
0:12:47.72,000 --> 0:12:48,000
of Nassar survivors

242
0:12:50.436,000 --> 0:12:52,000
who shared their stories

243
0:12:52.689,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and used their voices

244
0:12:55.194,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to invoke positive change for our world.

245
0:13:02.073,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I felt it was extremely important at that time

246
0:13:05.058,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to provide a safe space for Kyla and our team.

247
0:13:08.927,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And so I chose to talk about this in a few team meetings.

248
0:13:15.896,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Later that year, we won the national championship,

249
0:13:18.72,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and after we did, Kyla came up to me and shared with me the fact

250
0:13:21.959,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that she felt one reason that we'd won

251
0:13:24.845,000 --> 0:13:26,000
was because we had addressed the elephant in the room,

252
0:13:28.459,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the tragedy that had not only rocked the world

253
0:13:32.183,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but that had liberated the truths and the memories in herself

254
0:13:37.088,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and in so many of her friends

255
0:13:39.334,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and her peers.

256
0:13:43.019,000 --> 0:13:44,000
As Kyla said,

257
0:13:44.77,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"Ms. Val, I literally felt myself walk taller as the season went on,

258
0:13:49.606,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and when I walked onto that championship floor, I felt invincible."

259
0:13:53.397,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Simply --

260
0:14:01.158,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause)

261
0:14:13.111,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Simply because she had been heard.

262
0:14:17.931,000 --> 0:14:2,000
As parents, as coaches,

263
0:14:21.163,000 --> 0:14:22,000
as leaders,

264
0:14:22.949,000 --> 0:14:24,000
we can no longer lead from a place

265
0:14:27.183,000 --> 0:14:31,000
where winning is our only metric of success,

266
0:14:31.495,000 --> 0:14:34,000
where our ego sits center stage,

267
0:14:34.648,000 --> 0:14:35,000
because it has been proven

268
0:14:36.275,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that that process produces broken human beings.

269
0:14:40.424,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And I emphatically know

270
0:14:42.803,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that it is absolutely possible

271
0:14:45.386,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to produce and train champions in life

272
0:14:47.69,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in every single walk of life

273
0:14:50.761,000 --> 0:14:53,000
without compromising the human spirit.

274
0:14:55.904,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

275
0:15:02.975,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It starts with defining success

276
0:15:06.459,000 --> 0:15:09,000
for yourself and those under your care

277
0:15:11.081,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and then consistently

278
0:15:13.646,000 --> 0:15:18,000
self-examining whether your actions are in alignment with your goals.

279
0:15:20.791,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We are all coaches in some capacity.

280
0:15:24.987,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We all have a collective responsibility

281
0:15:28.801,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to develop champions in life for our world.

282
0:15:33.716,000 --> 0:15:35,000
That is what real success looks like,

283
0:15:37.587,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and in the world of athletics,

284
0:15:40.233,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that is what we call a win-win.

285
0:15:43.286,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Thank you.

286
0:15:44.475,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.464,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to talk about consciousness.

2
0:00:15.081,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Why consciousness?

3
0:00:16.561,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject,

4
0:00:19.387,000 --> 0:00:22,000
both in our scientific and our philosophical culture.

5
0:00:22.951,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now why is that curious?

6
0:00:24.223,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives

7
0:00:27.733,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for a very simple, logical reason,

8
0:00:29.691,000 --> 0:00:31,000
namely, it's a necessary condition on anything

9
0:00:32.088,000 --> 0:00:34,000
being important in our lives that we're conscious.

10
0:00:34.565,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You care about science, philosophy, music, art, whatever --

11
0:00:37.724,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma, right?

12
0:00:41.202,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So consciousness is number one.

13
0:00:43.546,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The second reason is that when people do

14
0:00:46.014,000 --> 0:00:48,000
get interested in it, as I think they should,

15
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
they tend to say the most appalling things.

16
0:00:51.181,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things

17
0:00:53.825,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and they're really trying to do serious research,

18
0:00:56.183,000 --> 0:00:59,000
well, it's been slow. Progress has been slow.

19
0:00:59.324,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When I first got interested in this, I thought, well,

20
0:01:02.464,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it's a straightforward problem in biology.

21
0:01:04.67,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Let's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out

22
0:01:07.167,000 --> 0:01:07,000
how it works in the brain.

23
0:01:08.051,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all

24
0:01:10.075,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the heavy-duty neurobiologists there,

25
0:01:11.868,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and they showed some impatience,

26
0:01:13.444,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions.

27
0:01:16.827,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But the thing that struck me is, one guy said in exasperation,

28
0:01:20.585,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a very famous neurobiologist, he said, "Look,

29
0:01:22.752,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness,

30
0:01:26.175,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but get tenure first. Get tenure first."

31
0:01:29.742,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now I've been working on this for a long time.

32
0:01:32.46,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I think now you might actually get tenure

33
0:01:34.438,000 --> 0:01:35,000
by working on consciousness.

34
0:01:35.796,000 --> 0:01:37,000
If so, that's a real step forward.

35
0:01:38.342,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Okay, now why then is this curious reluctance

36
0:01:41.247,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and curious hostility to consciousness?

37
0:01:43.145,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Well, I think it's a combination of two features

38
0:01:45.875,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of our intellectual culture

39
0:01:47.78,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that like to think they're opposing each other

40
0:01:50.306,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but in fact they share a common set of assumptions.

41
0:01:53.929,000 --> 0:01:56,000
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism:

42
0:01:57.891,000 --> 0:02:,000
Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.

43
0:02:01.216,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's a part of the spiritual world.

44
0:02:03.143,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It belongs to the soul,

45
0:02:04.679,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and the soul is not a part of the physical world.

46
0:02:07.975,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.

47
0:02:11.006,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this

48
0:02:13.111,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but accepts the worst assumption.

49
0:02:15.215,000 --> 0:02:19,000
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists:

50
0:02:19.293,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.

51
0:02:22.758,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Either it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else,

52
0:02:25.404,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a computer program or some damn fool thing,

53
0:02:28.054,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but in any case it's not part of science.

54
0:02:31.249,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache.

55
0:02:33.457,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Here's how it went.

56
0:02:35.076,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Science is objective, consciousness is subjective,

57
0:02:39.108,000 --> 0:02:42,000
therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness.

58
0:02:42.435,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Okay, so these twin traditions are paralyzing us.

59
0:02:48.939,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's very hard to get out of these twin traditions.

60
0:02:51.807,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I have only one real message in this lecture,

61
0:02:54.825,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and that is, consciousness is a biological phenomenon

62
0:02:58.209,000 --> 0:03:,000
like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis --

63
0:03:01.098,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you know all the biological phenomena -- and once you accept that,

64
0:03:05.433,000 --> 0:03:07,000
most, though not all, of the hard problems

65
0:03:08.072,000 --> 0:03:1,000
about consciousness simply evaporate.

66
0:03:10.347,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I'm going to go through some of them.

67
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Okay, now I promised you to tell you some

68
0:03:14.733,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of the outrageous things said about consciousness.

69
0:03:17.472,000 --> 0:03:2,000
One: Consciousness does not exist.

70
0:03:21.072,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's an illusion, like sunsets.

71
0:03:23.302,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions.

72
0:03:28.367,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So consciousness is an illusion.

73
0:03:30.29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Two: Well, maybe it exists, but it's really something else.

74
0:03:33.545,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's a computer program running in the brain.

75
0:03:37.326,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Three: No, the only thing that exists is really behavior.

76
0:03:41.14,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was,

77
0:03:44.748,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but I'll get back to that.

78
0:03:46.103,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And four: Maybe consciousness exists,

79
0:03:48.837,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but it can't make any difference to the world.

80
0:03:51.052,000 --> 0:03:53,000
How could spirituality move anything?

81
0:03:53.772,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, whenever somebody tells me that, I think,

82
0:03:55.987,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you want to see spirituality move something?

83
0:03:58.277,000 --> 0:04:,000
Watch. I decide consciously to raise my arm,

84
0:04:01.129,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and the damn thing goes up. (Laughter)

85
0:04:03.738,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Furthermore, notice this:

86
0:04:07.509,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We do not say, "Well, it's a bit like the weather in Geneva.

87
0:04:11.504,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Some days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up."

88
0:04:14.152,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to.

89
0:04:16.807,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Okay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible.

90
0:04:19.117,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.

91
0:04:22.616,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You can't do this if you don't give a definition.

92
0:04:24.974,000 --> 0:04:26,000
People always say consciousness is very hard to define.

93
0:04:27.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I think it's rather easy to define

94
0:04:29.843,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if you're not trying to give a scientific definition.

95
0:04:32.052,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We're not ready for a scientific definition,

96
0:04:34.332,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but here's a common-sense definition.

97
0:04:36.118,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling

98
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or sentience or awareness.

99
0:04:40.988,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep,

100
0:04:44.546,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and it goes on all day until you fall asleep

101
0:04:47.015,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or die or otherwise become unconscious.

102
0:04:50.213,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition.

103
0:04:53.333,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now, that's the common-sense definition. That's our target.

104
0:04:56.235,000 --> 0:04:59,000
If you're not talking about that, you're not talking about consciousness.

105
0:04:59.736,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But they think, "Well, if that's it, that's an awful problem.

106
0:05:03.22,000 --> 0:05:06,000
How can such a thing exist as part of the real world?"

107
0:05:07.178,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And this, if you've ever had a philosophy course,

108
0:05:09.536,000 --> 0:05:11,000
this is known as the famous mind-body problem.

109
0:05:12.287,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you.

110
0:05:15.55,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And here it is: All of our conscious states, without exception,

111
0:05:19.552,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain,

112
0:05:25.077,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and they are realized in the brain

113
0:05:27.258,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as higher-level or system features.

114
0:05:29.592,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water.

115
0:05:32.748,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Right? The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out

116
0:05:36.223,000 --> 0:05:37,000
by the H2O molecules.

117
0:05:37.913,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's a condition that the system is in.

118
0:05:40.791,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid

119
0:05:45.953,000 --> 0:05:47,000
depending on the behavior of the molecules,

120
0:05:48.025,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so your brain can go from a state of being conscious

121
0:05:50.902,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to a state of being unconscious,

122
0:05:52.542,000 --> 0:05:54,000
depending on the behavior of the molecules.

123
0:05:55.528,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The famous mind-body problem is that simple.

124
0:05:59.913,000 --> 0:06:02,000
All right? But now we get into some harder questions.

125
0:06:03.09,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Let's specify the exact features of consciousness,

126
0:06:06.534,000 --> 0:06:08,000
so that we can then answer those four objections

127
0:06:09.006,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that I made to it.

128
0:06:10.293,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.

129
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You can't get rid of it.

130
0:06:16.614,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You see, the distinction between reality and illusion

131
0:06:20.785,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is the distinction between how things

132
0:06:23.454,000 --> 0:06:26,000
consciously seem to us and how they really are.

133
0:06:27.328,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It consciously seems like there's --

134
0:06:29.204,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I like the French "arc-en-ciel" —

135
0:06:30.872,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it seems like there's an arch in the sky,

136
0:06:33.07,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains.

137
0:06:36.85,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening.

138
0:06:39.947,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But for that distinction between

139
0:06:41.874,000 --> 0:06:43,000
how things consciously seem and how they really are,

140
0:06:44.375,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness,

141
0:06:48.43,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned,

142
0:06:52.281,000 --> 0:06:54,000
if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious,

143
0:06:55.261,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you are conscious.

144
0:06:57.146,000 --> 0:07:,000
I mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say,

145
0:07:00.5,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"We are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we've done a study

146
0:07:03.191,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious,

147
0:07:05.941,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you are a very cleverly constructed robot,"

148
0:07:08.013,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I don't think, "Well, maybe these guys are right, you know?"

149
0:07:11.282,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I don't think that for a moment, because, I mean,

150
0:07:13.845,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Descartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this.

151
0:07:16.755,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness.

152
0:07:19.71,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Okay, that's the first feature of consciousness.

153
0:07:22.02,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's real and irreducible.

154
0:07:23.824,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion

155
0:07:27.055,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in a way that you can with other standard illusions.

156
0:07:30.284,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Okay, the second feature is this one

157
0:07:32.816,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that has been such a source of trouble to us,

158
0:07:35.281,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and that is, all of our conscious states

159
0:07:37.463,000 --> 0:07:39,000
have this qualitative character to them.

160
0:07:40.427,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There's something that it feels like to drink beer

161
0:07:42.832,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which is not what it feels like to do your income tax

162
0:07:45.777,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or listen to music, and this qualitative feel

163
0:07:48.845,000 --> 0:07:5,000
automatically generates a third feature,

164
0:07:51.406,000 --> 0:07:54,000
namely, conscious states are by definition subjective

165
0:07:55.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in the sense that they only exist as experienced

166
0:07:58.155,000 --> 0:08:,000
by some human or animal subject,

167
0:08:00.35,000 --> 0:08:01,000
some self that experiences them.

168
0:08:02.223,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine.

169
0:08:04.606,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Since we don't know how our brains do it,

170
0:08:06.759,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine.

171
0:08:10.894,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Okay. Another feature of consciousness

172
0:08:13.669,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is that it comes in unified conscious fields.

173
0:08:17.82,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me

174
0:08:20.176,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes

175
0:08:22.89,000 --> 0:08:24,000
against the floor, but they occur to me

176
0:08:25.065,000 --> 0:08:28,000
as part of one single great conscious field

177
0:08:28.547,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that stretches forward and backward.

178
0:08:30.563,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That is the key to understanding

179
0:08:32.332,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the enormous power of consciousness.

180
0:08:34.771,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And we have not been able to do that in a robot.

181
0:08:37.715,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact

182
0:08:40.216,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that we don't know how to make a conscious robot,

183
0:08:42.574,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.

184
0:08:45.623,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Okay, the next feature of consciousness,

185
0:08:48.131,000 --> 0:08:51,000
after this marvelous unified conscious field,

186
0:08:51.246,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is that it functions causally in our behavior.

187
0:08:54.039,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand,

188
0:08:57.242,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but how is that possible?

189
0:08:58.992,000 --> 0:09:01,000
How can it be that this thought in my brain

190
0:09:02.756,000 --> 0:09:04,000
can move material objects?

191
0:09:04.956,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Well, I'll tell you the answer.

192
0:09:06.457,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer,

193
0:09:08.481,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but we know the basic part of the answer, and that is,

194
0:09:11.183,000 --> 0:09:13,000
there is a sequence of neuron firings,

195
0:09:13.476,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and they terminate where the acetylcholine

196
0:09:16.563,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.

197
0:09:19.384,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Sorry to use philosophical terminology here,

198
0:09:21.504,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons,

199
0:09:25.475,000 --> 0:09:27,000
a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels

200
0:09:28.261,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the damned arm goes up.

201
0:09:30.167,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now, think of what I told you.

202
0:09:32.291,000 --> 0:09:33,000
One and the same event,

203
0:09:34.033,000 --> 0:09:37,000
my conscious decision to raise my arm

204
0:09:37.068,000 --> 0:09:39,000
has a level of description where it has all of these

205
0:09:39.863,000 --> 0:09:41,000
touchy-feely spiritual qualities.

206
0:09:42.009,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's a thought in my brain, but at the same time,

207
0:09:44.41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it's busy secreting acetylcholine

208
0:09:46.396,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and doing all sorts of other things

209
0:09:48.087,000 --> 0:09:5,000
as it makes its way from the motor cortex

210
0:09:50.719,000 --> 0:09:52,000
down through the nerve fibers in the arm.

211
0:09:53.416,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies

212
0:09:57.232,000 --> 0:10:,000
for discussing these issues are totally obsolete.

213
0:10:00.616,000 --> 0:10:03,000
One and the same event has a level of description

214
0:10:03.873,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where it's neurobiological, and another level of description

215
0:10:06.839,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where it's mental, and that's a single event,

216
0:10:09.03,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and that's how nature works. That's how it's possible

217
0:10:11.578,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for consciousness to function causally.

218
0:10:14.171,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Okay, now with that in mind,

219
0:10:17.03,000 --> 0:10:2,000
with going through these various features of consciousness,

220
0:10:20.097,000 --> 0:10:23,000
let's go back and answer some of those early objections.

221
0:10:23.269,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well, the first one I said was, consciousness doesn't exist,

222
0:10:26.878,000 --> 0:10:27,000
it's an illusion. Well, I've already answered that.

223
0:10:28.712,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I don't think we need to worry about that.

224
0:10:30.736,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But the second one had an incredible influence,

225
0:10:34.092,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and may still be around, and that is,

226
0:10:35.936,000 --> 0:10:38,000
"Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.

227
0:10:39.127,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's really a digital computer program running in your brain

228
0:10:42.89,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and that's what we need to do to create consciousness

229
0:10:45.438,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is get the right program.

230
0:10:46.891,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Yeah, forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do

231
0:10:49.439,000 --> 0:10:52,000
provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program."

232
0:10:52.606,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, we know that that's wrong.

233
0:10:55.164,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I mean, anybody who's thought about computers at all

234
0:10:58.173,000 --> 0:11:,000
can see that that's wrong, because computation

235
0:11:00.637,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is defined as symbol manipulation,

236
0:11:03.052,000 --> 0:11:05,000
usually thought of as zeros as ones, but any symbols will do.

237
0:11:05.981,000 --> 0:11:08,000
You get an algorithm that you can program

238
0:11:09.103,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in a binary code, and that's the defining trait

239
0:11:12.21,000 --> 0:11:14,000
of the computer program.

240
0:11:14.261,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic.

241
0:11:18.144,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.

242
0:11:22.159,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's got a content in addition to the syntax.

243
0:11:25.352,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's got a semantics.

244
0:11:26.849,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now that argument, I made that argument 30 --

245
0:11:29.338,000 --> 0:11:3,000
oh my God, I don't want to think about it —

246
0:11:30.629,000 --> 0:11:31,000
more than 30 years ago,

247
0:11:31.971,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you,

248
0:11:34.9,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is,

249
0:11:37.943,000 --> 0:11:41,000
consciousness creates an observer-independent reality.

250
0:11:42.093,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It creates a reality of money, property, government,

251
0:11:45.581,000 --> 0:11:48,000
marriage, CERN conferences,

252
0:11:49.553,000 --> 0:11:51,000
cocktail parties and summer vacations,

253
0:11:52.172,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and all of those are creations of consciousness.

254
0:11:54.921,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Their existence is observer-relative.

255
0:11:57.756,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper

256
0:12:01.259,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university.

257
0:12:04.106,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now, ask yourself about computation.

258
0:12:07.98,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Is that absolute, like force and mass and gravitational attraction?

259
0:12:11.649,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Or is it observer-relative?

260
0:12:13.781,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Well, some computations are intrinsic.

261
0:12:17.308,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I add two plus two to get four.

262
0:12:19.219,000 --> 0:12:21,000
That's going on no matter what anybody thinks.

263
0:12:21.79,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But when I haul out my pocket calculator

264
0:12:24.279,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and do the calculation, the only intrinsic phenomenon

265
0:12:28.061,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is the electronic circuit and its behavior.

266
0:12:31.236,000 --> 0:12:32,000
That's the only absolute phenomenon.

267
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
All the rest is interpreted by us.

268
0:12:35.428,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Computation only exists relative to consciousness.

269
0:12:39.269,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation,

270
0:12:42.044,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation.

271
0:12:45.83,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary.

272
0:12:48.755,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I spent a lot of money on this hardware.

273
0:12:51.203,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But we have this persistent confusion

274
0:12:53.349,000 --> 0:12:57,000
between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality

275
0:12:58.07,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims.

276
0:13:01.998,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this:

277
0:13:05.164,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can have a completely objective science,

278
0:13:08.815,000 --> 0:13:1,000
a science where you make objectively true claims,

279
0:13:11.727,000 --> 0:13:14,000
about a domain whose existence is subjective,

280
0:13:15.157,000 --> 0:13:18,000
whose existence is in the human brain

281
0:13:18.392,000 --> 0:13:2,000
consisting of subjective states of sentience

282
0:13:20.531,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or feeling or awareness.

283
0:13:22.216,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness

284
0:13:26.553,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because it's subjective and science is objective, that's a pun.

285
0:13:30.761,000 --> 0:13:32,000
That's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity.

286
0:13:33.47,000 --> 0:13:35,000
You can make objective claims

287
0:13:35.794,000 --> 0:13:39,000
about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence,

288
0:13:39.836,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and indeed that's what neurologists do.

289
0:13:41.409,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains,

290
0:13:43.957,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and you try to get an objective science of that.

291
0:13:46.588,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys,

292
0:13:48.66,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and I don't have an awful lot of time left,

293
0:13:50.235,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but let me refute a couple more of them.

294
0:13:52.164,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I said that behaviorism ought to be

295
0:13:54.378,000 --> 0:13:57,000
one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture,

296
0:13:57.667,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because it's refuted the moment you think about it.

297
0:14:00.56,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Your mental states are identical with your behavior?

298
0:14:03.417,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Well, think about the distinction between feeling a pain

299
0:14:06.568,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and engaging in pain behavior.

300
0:14:08.271,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I won't demonstrate pain behavior, but I can tell you

301
0:14:10.259,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I'm not having any pains right now.

302
0:14:12.098,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake?

303
0:14:16.218,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The mistake was — and you can go back and read

304
0:14:18.433,000 --> 0:14:2,000
the literature on this, you can see this over and over —

305
0:14:21.124,000 --> 0:14:24,000
they think if you accept the irreducible existence

306
0:14:24.707,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of consciousness, you're giving up on science.

307
0:14:27.502,000 --> 0:14:3,000
You're giving up on 300 years of human progress

308
0:14:30.573,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and human hope and all the rest of it.

309
0:14:32.407,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And the message I want to leave you with is,

310
0:14:35.222,000 --> 0:14:37,000
consciousness has to become accepted

311
0:14:37.665,000 --> 0:14:39,000
as a genuine biological phenomenon,

312
0:14:40.153,000 --> 0:14:42,000
as much subject to scientific analysis

313
0:14:42.62,000 --> 0:14:43,000
as any other phenomenon in biology,

314
0:14:44.58,000 --> 0:14:46,000
or, for that matter, the rest of science.

315
0:14:46.734,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Thank you very much.

316
0:14:48.116,000 --> 0:14:53,000

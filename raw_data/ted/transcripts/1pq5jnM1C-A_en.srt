1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you know how many choices you make

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in a typical day?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Do you know how many choices you make

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in typical week?

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I recently did a survey

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with over 2,000 Americans,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and the average number of choices

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that the typical American reports making

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is about 70 in a typical day.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
There was also recently a study done with CEOs

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that these CEOs engaged in

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and how much time they spent engaging

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in making decisions related to these tasks.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And they found that the average CEO

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
50 percent of their decisions

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
were made in nine minutes or less.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Only about 12 percent of the decisions

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
did they make an hour or more of their time.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Think about your own choices.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Do you know how many choices

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
make it into your nine minute category

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
versus your one hour category?

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How well do you think you're doing

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
at managing those choices?

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Today I want to talk

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which is the choice overload problem.

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I want to talk about the problem

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and some potential solutions.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now as I talk about this problem,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I'm going to have some questions for you

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I'm going to want to know your answers.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So when I ask you a question,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
since I'm blind,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Otherwise, when I ask you a question,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and if your answer is yes,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
I'd like you to clap your hands.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So for my first question for you today:

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Thank you.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
at least at that time it was truly upscale.

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It was a store called Draeger's.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and over 500 different kinds

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of fruits and vegetables

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I used to love going to this store,

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but on one occasion I asked myself,

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
well how come you never buy anything?

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Here's their olive oil aisle.

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
including those that were in a locked case

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I asked the manager,

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that would show up everyday,

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
with cameras ready usually.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We decided to do a little experiment,

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and we picked jam for our experiment.

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Here's their jam aisle.

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They had 348 different kinds of jam.

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We set up a little tasting booth

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
right near the entrance of the store.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We there put out six different flavors of jam

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or 24 different flavors of jam,

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we looked at two things:

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
First, in which case

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
than when there were six,

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
about 40 percent.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The next thing we looked at

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is in which case were people more likely

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to buy a jar of jam.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now we see the opposite effect.

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Of the people who stopped when there were 24,

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Of the people who stopped when there were six,

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
well now we saw that 30 percent of them

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
actually bought a jar of jam.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now if you do the math,

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
if they encountered six

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
than if they encountered 24.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is probably good for us --

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
at least it's good for our waistlines --

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
even in very consequential decisions.

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We choose not to choose,

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
even when it goes against our best self-interests.

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where we looked at the retirement savings decisions

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of nearly a million Americans

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from about 650 plans

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
all in the U.S.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And what we looked at

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was whether the number of fund offerings

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
available in a retirement savings plan,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the 401(k) plan,

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
does that affect people's likelihood

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
to save more for tomorrow.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And what we found

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
was that indeed there was a correlation.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that ranged from offering people

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And what we found was that,

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the more funds offered,

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
indeed, there was less participation rate.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So if you look at the extremes,

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
those plans that offered you two funds,

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
participation rates were around in the mid-70s --

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
still not as high as we want it to be.

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
participation rates have now dropped

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to about the 60th percentile.

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now it turns out

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that even if you do choose to participate

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
when there are more choices present,

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
even then, it has negative consequences.

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So for those people who did choose to participate,

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the more choices available,

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the more likely people were

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.

141
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The more choices available,

142
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the more likely they were

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to put all their money in pure money market accounts.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now neither of these extreme decisions

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are the kinds of decisions

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that any of us would recommend for people

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
when you're considering their future financial well-being.

148
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Well, over the past decade,

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we have observed three main negative consequences

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to offering people more and more choices.

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They're more likely to delay choosing --

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They're more likely to make worse choices --

154
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
worse financial choices, medical choices.

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
even when they do objectively better.

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The main reason for this

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,

160
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and actually picking from that stunning display.

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So what I want to propose to you today

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
are four simple techniques --

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
techniques that we have tested in one way or another

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in different research venues --

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that you can easily apply

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in your businesses.

168
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The first: Cut.

169
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You've heard it said before,

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but it's never been more true than today,

171
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that less is more.

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."

173
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is that if you are willing to cut,

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
get rid of those extraneous redundant options,

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
well there's an increase in sales,

178
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
there's a lowering of costs,

179
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
there is an improvement of the choosing experience.

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
When Proctor & Gamble

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
went from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,

182
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.

183
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
When the Golden Cat Corporation

184
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they saw an increase in profits

186
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
by 87 percent --

187
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a function of both increase in sales

188
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and lowering of costs.

189
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You know, the average grocery store today

190
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
offers you 45,000 products.

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.

192
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But the ninth largest retailer,

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the ninth biggest retailer in the world today

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is Aldi,

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and it offers you only 1,400 products --

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
one kind of canned tomato sauce.

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now in the financial savings world,

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I think one of the best examples that has recently come out

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
on how to best manage the choice offerings

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which was the program that they have at Harvard.

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Every single Harvard employee

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is now automatically enrolled

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in a lifecycle fund.

205
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
For those people who actually want to choose,

206
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
they're given 20 funds,

207
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
not 300 or more funds.

208
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
You know, often, people say,

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"I don't know how to cut.

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They're all important choices."

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And if your employees can't tell them apart,

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
neither can your consumers."

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now before we started our session this afternoon,

216
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I had a chat with Gary.

217
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And Gary said that he would be willing

218
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to offer people in this audience

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
an all-expenses-paid free vacation

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to the most beautiful road in the world.

221
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Here's a description of the road.

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And I'd like you to read it.

223
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it

224
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then I want you to clap your hands

225
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.

226
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Light clapping)

227
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.

228
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Is that all?

229
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
All right, let me show you some more about this.

230
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Honk)

233
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now who's ready to go on this trip.

234
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

235
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Laughter)

236
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I think I might have actually heard more hands.

237
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
All right.

238
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now in fact,

239
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
you had objectively more information

240
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the first time around than the second time around,

241
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but I would venture to guess

242
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that you felt that it was more real the second time around.

243
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Because the pictures made it feel

244
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
more real to you.

245
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Which brings me to the second technique

246
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for handling the choice overload problem,

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which is concretization.

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That in order for people to understand

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the differences between the choices,

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they have to be able to understand

251
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the consequences associated with each choice,

252
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and that the consequences need to be felt

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.

254
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more

255
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
when they use an ATM card or a credit card

256
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
as opposed to cash?

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Because it doesn't feel like real money.

258
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it turns out

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that making it feel more concrete

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
can actually be a very positive tool

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to use in getting people to save more.

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi

263
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and Alessandro Previtero,

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we did a study with people at ING --

265
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
employees that are all working at ING --

266
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and now these people were all in a session

267
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And during that session,

269
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,

270
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but we added one little thing.

271
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The one little thing we added

272
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
was we asked people

273
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
if you saved more.

275
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
By doing that simple thing,

276
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account

279
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
by four percent.

280
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The third technique: Categorization.

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We can handle more categories

282
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
than we can handle choices.

283
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So for example,

284
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.

285
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores

286
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
up and down the northeast corridor,

287
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the magazine aisles range anywhere

288
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
from 331 different kinds of magazines

289
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
all the way up to 664.

290
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But you know what?

291
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
If I show you 600 magazines

292
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and I divide them up into 10 categories,

293
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
versus I show you 400 magazines

294
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and divide them up into 20 categories,

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
you believe that I have given you

296
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
more choice and a better choosing experience

297
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
if I gave you the 400

298
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
than if I gave you the 600.

299
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.

300
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Here are two different jewelry displays.

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."

302
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
If you think the display on the left is Swing

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the display on the right is Jazz,

304
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
clap your hands.

305
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Light Clapping)

306
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Okay, there's some.

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
clap your hands.

309
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Okay, a bit more.

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now it turns out you're right.

311
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

312
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but you know what?

313
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.

314
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter)

315
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
The categories need to say something

316
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to the chooser, not the choice-maker.

317
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And you often see that problem

318
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.

319
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?

320
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.

321
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It turns out we can actually

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
handle a lot more information than we think we can,

323
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
we've just got to take it a little easier.

324
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We have to gradually increase the complexity.

325
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Let's take a very, very complicated decision:

327
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
buying a car.

328
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Here's a German car manufacturer

329
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.

330
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
You've got to make 60 different decisions,

331
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
completely make up your car.

332
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Now these decisions vary

333
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in the number of choices that they offer per decision.

334
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Car colors, exterior car colors --

335
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I've got 56 choices.

336
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.

337
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
So now what I'm going to do

338
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.

339
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So half of the customers

340
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,

341
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to low choice, four gearshifts.

342
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The other half of the customers

343
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,

344
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to 56 car colors, high choice.

345
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
What am I going to look at?

346
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
How engaged you are.

347
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
If you keep hitting the default button per decision,

348
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that means you're getting overwhelmed,

349
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that means I'm losing you.

350
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
What you find

351
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
is the people who go from high choice to low choice,

352
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.

353
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We're losing them.

354
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They go from low choice to high choice,

355
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
they're hanging in there.

356
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.

357
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The only thing that I have done

358
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is I have varied the order

359
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in which that information is presented.

360
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
If I start you off easy,

361
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I learn how to choose.

362
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Even though choosing gearshift

363
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,

364
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
it still prepares me for how to choose.

365
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,

366
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
so I'm more willing to be motivated

367
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to be engaged.

368
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So let me recap.

369
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I have talked about four techniques

370
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for mitigating the problem of choice overload --

371
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;

372
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
concretize -- make it real;

373
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;

374
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
condition for complexity.

375
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today

376
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
are designed to help you manage your choices --

377
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
better for you, you can use them on yourself,

378
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
better for the people that you are serving.

379
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Because I believe that the key

380
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
to getting the most from choice

381
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
is to be choosy about choosing.

382
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing

383
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the better we will be able

384
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
to practice the art of choosing.

385
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thank you very much.

386
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

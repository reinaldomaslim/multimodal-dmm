1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.48,000 --> 0:00:16,000
all the developed countries in the world --

3
0:00:17.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the wealthier ones --

4
0:00:18.4,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and all of the charities

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
together donated about 200 billion dollars

6
0:00:23.72,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to developing countries in the world --

7
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the ones that bear most of the burden,

8
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the heaviest burden of the world's biggest problems:

9
0:00:30.84,000 --> 0:00:34,000
poverty, hunger, climate change and inequality.

10
0:00:35.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That same year,

11
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
businesses invested in those same countries 3.7 trillion dollars.

12
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work

13
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I'm privileged to see the amazing things

14
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that NGOs and some governments are doing

15
0:00:53.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with some of that 200 billion dollars:

16
0:00:56.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
helping malnourished children

17
0:00:58.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
or families that don't have access to clean water,

18
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:03,000
children who wouldn't be educated otherwise.

19
0:01:04.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But it's not enough

20
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because the biggest problems in our world need trillions

21
0:01:11.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
not just billions.

22
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So if we're going to make lasting and significant progress

23
0:01:17.84,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in the big challenges in our world,

24
0:01:20.84,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we need business,

25
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
both the companies and the investors,

26
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to drive the solutions.

27
0:01:28.76,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So let's talk about what business should do.

28
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And when I say that,

29
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you probably think that I'm going to talk about corporate philanthropy

30
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or corporate social responsibility.

31
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:43,000
CSR is the norm today,

32
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and it's very useful.

33
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It provides a route for corporate generosity

34
0:01:49.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and that generosity is important to many corporations' employees

35
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and customers.

36
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But you know what?

37
0:01:56.8,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's just not big enough,

38
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or strong enough,

39
0:01:59.64,000 --> 0:02:,000
or durable enough

40
0:02:01.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to drive solutions to the biggest problems in our world today

41
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because it's incremental cost.

42
0:02:09.52,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Even when business is booming,

43
0:02:12.24,000 --> 0:02:16,000
CSR just isn't designed to scale.

44
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And then of course in a downturn,

45
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it's one of the first programs to be cut.

46
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So no,

47
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
CSR --

48
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
corporate social responsibility --

49
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
isn't the answer,

50
0:02:30.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but TSI --

51
0:02:32.44,000 --> 0:02:34,000
total societal impact, is.

52
0:02:36.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
TSI is the sum of all of the ways

53
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
business can affect society

54
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by doing the real work:

55
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
thinking about their supply chains,

56
0:02:47.88,000 --> 0:02:5,000
working on their product design and manufacturing processes

57
0:02:51.72,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and their distribution.

58
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The real work of business,

59
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:03:,000
when done with innovation,

60
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
can actually create core business benefits for the company

61
0:03:05.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it can solve the meaningful problems in our world today.

62
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So what does TSI look like?

63
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Focusing on TSI

64
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:21,000
means incorporating social and environmental considerations.

65
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And you know what?

66
0:03:23.72,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's something that isn't completely new.

67
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's been thought about for a while.

68
0:03:29.2,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But the hard part is that corporations almost exclusively still think

69
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
about something called TSR:

70
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:38,000
total shareholder returns.

71
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But TSI --

72
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
total societal impact --

73
0:03:44.56,000 --> 0:03:48,000
needs to stand alongside TSR

74
0:03:48.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
as an important and valid driver of corporate strategy

75
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and corporate decision-making.

76
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And we've got the data to show you why and how.

77
0:04:00.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Some companies are already making this happen.

78
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They're beginning to make it happen.

79
0:04:06.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So let me tell you the story about Mars.

80
0:04:09.76,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Mars is the sixth-largest private company in the United States.

81
0:04:14.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If you're like me,

82
0:04:16.44,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they make some important products,

83
0:04:18.68,000 --> 0:04:19,000
like coffee and chocolate.

84
0:04:21.12,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So not surprisingly,

85
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
one of their most important ingredients is cocoa.

86
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And some of their competitors are actually really worried

87
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:33,000
about the sustainability and the availability of cocoa supplies.

88
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But not Mars.

89
0:04:36.48,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They're confident in the stable supply of that crop for the long term.

90
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And why is that?

91
0:04:43.32,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's because they partner with NGOs around the world

92
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that are working with small shareholder farmers.

93
0:04:50.8,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And those certification agency's NGOs

94
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
are working to help farmers improve crop yields,

95
0:04:57.48,000 --> 0:05:,000
they're making sure that they get a fair, premium, livable wage

96
0:05:01.68,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and they're helping them address any human rights potential issues

97
0:05:05.52,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in supply chains,

98
0:05:06.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and they're helping minimize the effects on the environment,

99
0:05:10.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
like deforestation.

100
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Mars is on a path to 100 percent certified cocoa,

101
0:05:16.28,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so this is a good program for farming communities,

102
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it's a good program for the environment,

103
0:05:22.84,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and it's a good program for Mars,

104
0:05:25.44,000 --> 0:05:28,000
who has solved a significant risk in their supply chain.

105
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But now let's get to the data,

106
0:05:33.12,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because it's actually really awesome.

107
0:05:36.28,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And let me explain exactly what the data points I'm going to talk about are.

108
0:05:41.76,000 --> 0:05:45,000
When analysts and financial people look at companies,

109
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they think about a lot of different statistics.

110
0:05:48.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I want to talk about two of the most important ones.

111
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I'm going to talk about the overall value of a company --

112
0:05:54.92,000 --> 0:05:55,000
its valuation --

113
0:05:56.72,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and I'm going to talk about its margin.

114
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Basically the difference between all of its earnings

115
0:06:02.84,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and all of its costs.

116
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So in our study,

117
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we looked at oil and gas companies,

118
0:06:10.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and the oil and gas companies

119
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that are performing most strongly on TSI --

120
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:16,000
total societal impact --

121
0:06:16.96,000 --> 0:06:2,000
see a 19 percent premium on their valuation.

122
0:06:22.12,000 --> 0:06:23,000
19 percent.

123
0:06:23.96,000 --> 0:06:24,000
When they do really well

124
0:06:25.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
on things like minimizing the impact of their company

125
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:3,000
on the environment and water,

126
0:06:31.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and when they have very strong occupational health and safety programs.

127
0:06:35.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And when they also add in strong employee training programs,

128
0:06:40.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they get a 3.4 percentage point premium on their margins.

129
0:06:45.28,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But what about other industries?

130
0:06:47.88,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Biopharmaceutical companies that are the strongest performers on TSI

131
0:06:52.12,000 --> 0:06:55,000
see a 12 percent premium on their valuation.

132
0:06:55.6,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And then if they're best at expanded access to medicines --

133
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
making medicines available for the people who need them --

134
0:07:02.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
they see a 6.7 percentage point premium on their gross margins.

135
0:07:08.96,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For the retail banks that are strongest on TSI,

136
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they see a three percentage point premium on their valuation,

137
0:07:17.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and then for those that differentially provide financial inclusion --

138
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:23,000
access to financial products for people who need it --

139
0:07:24.56,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they see a 0.5 percentage point premium in their net income margin.

140
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, these numbers for banks may not seem very big,

141
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but in highly competitive industries,

142
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:4,000
even really small differences in margin matter a lot.

143
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, what about those consumer goods companies --

144
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the ones who make those products we love like coffee and chocolate?

145
0:07:49.04,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Consumer goods companies that perform best on total societal impact

146
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
see an 11 percent valuation premium.

147
0:07:59.52,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And then if they do those smart things with their supply chain --

148
0:08:03.12,000 --> 0:08:06,000
inclusive and responsibly sourcing their product --

149
0:08:06.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they see a 4.8 percentage point premium on their gross margins.

150
0:08:13.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
These numbers are significant.

151
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We've long known that things like fundamental financials,

152
0:08:19.88,000 --> 0:08:23,000
growth rates and financial risks are key drivers of valuation,

153
0:08:25.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but this rigorous analysis shows that social and environmental factors --

154
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:32,000
total societal impact measures --

155
0:08:33.32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
are also linked to valuations and margins.

156
0:08:39.44,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Wow.

157
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:42,000
All else equal --

158
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we didn't confuse the analysis with anything.

159
0:08:45.4,000 --> 0:08:46,000
All else being equal,

160
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:52,000
companies that perform strongly on social and environmental areas

161
0:08:53.039,000 --> 0:08:54,000
achieve higher margins

162
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and higher valuations.

163
0:08:57.96,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, I do understand

164
0:09:00.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that companies are under a lot of short-term earnings pressures.

165
0:09:06.28,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But fortunately,

166
0:09:07.92,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the investors who create some of this pressure

167
0:09:11.44,000 --> 0:09:15,000
are actually more and more themselves starting to think longer-term

168
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and starting to think with this TSI lens.

169
0:09:20.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In our conversations and surveys with investors,

170
0:09:23.8,000 --> 0:09:28,000
75 percent of them say they expect to see improved revenues

171
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and improved operating efficiency

172
0:09:32.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for companies that are thinking with a TSI lens.

173
0:09:36.04,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And they're actually starting to incorporate this

174
0:09:38.4,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in their own investing behavior.

175
0:09:41.48,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Last year,

176
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
23 trillion in global assets

177
0:09:47.64,000 --> 0:09:5,000
were in the category of socially responsible investing.

178
0:09:52.24,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, that's five billion over just the last two years.

179
0:09:57.56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And it represents a quarter of the total global assets managed in the world.

180
0:10:05.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I know that some of you may be cringing a little bit right now.

181
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Because in my decades of strategy consulting

182
0:10:13.44,000 --> 0:10:17,000
with businesses and NGOs and governments around the world,

183
0:10:18.4,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I find that many businesspeople

184
0:10:21.8,000 --> 0:10:25,000
are hesitant to talk or even sometimes think about

185
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the business benefits of doing good.

186
0:10:30.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They somehow think it's going to negate the value

187
0:10:32.76,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of the benefits they're creating for society.

188
0:10:35.48,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Or that they'll be perceived as heartless or even mercenary.

189
0:10:40.76,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But we really do need to think differently.

190
0:10:44.92,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We need to think differently

191
0:10:46.36,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because the only way we're going to make substantial progress

192
0:10:50.52,000 --> 0:10:52,000
on the challenging problems of our time

193
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is for business to drive the solutions.

194
0:10:56.44,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The job of business is to meet customer needs

195
0:11:00.28,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and to do so profitably.

196
0:11:02.32,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They need to to survive.

197
0:11:04.88,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So one of the best ways for businesses to help ensure their own growth,

198
0:11:10.96,000 --> 0:11:11,000
their own longevity,

199
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is to meet some of the hardest challenges in our society

200
0:11:17.72,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and to do so profitably.

201
0:11:20.4,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And when they do that innovatively,

202
0:11:23.48,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when they do that ethically, responsibly, incredibly,

203
0:11:28.6,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they should be proud.

204
0:11:34.2,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But if you still aren't sure about this,

205
0:11:37.72,000 --> 0:11:39,000
let's talk about a few more examples.

206
0:11:40.92,000 --> 0:11:41,000
What if you're a technology company

207
0:11:42.88,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and you're trying to grow your platform

208
0:11:45.56,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and you're trying to grow your customers?

209
0:11:48.08,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Like, Airbnb.

210
0:11:50.08,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Airbnb has a portfolio of total societal impact activities.

211
0:11:55.8,000 --> 0:11:57,000
They're all spot-on their core business.

212
0:11:58.64,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In one initiative,

213
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
they're helping enable their community

214
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to provide housing for free to those in disaster:

215
0:12:05.6,000 --> 0:12:07,000
crisis survivors and relief workers.

216
0:12:08.68,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In another effort on their part,

217
0:12:11.72,000 --> 0:12:14,000
they're actually helping and working with NGOs

218
0:12:15.56,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to ensure that people can provide housing for free for refugees.

219
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now, what I love about this program

220
0:12:23.36,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is that I don't think most people would've figured out

221
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
how to express their generosity

222
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and open their homes for those in such dire need --

223
0:12:31.2,000 --> 0:12:34,000
certainly not so quickly or so easily or efficiently --

224
0:12:34.24,000 --> 0:12:36,000
without this innovation by Airbnb.

225
0:12:37.84,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But at the same time,

226
0:12:39.84,000 --> 0:12:41,000
this is core to their corporate strategy

227
0:12:42.48,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and core to their growth

228
0:12:44.52,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because they grow by increasing the number of hosts and guests

229
0:12:49.68,000 --> 0:12:5,000
using their platform.

230
0:12:52.56,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But if they'd only been thinking exclusively

231
0:12:55.56,000 --> 0:12:57,000
about the return side of things,

232
0:12:58.08,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I'm not sure they would have ever figured out this route to growth,

233
0:13:01.28,000 --> 0:13:03,000
because they're not charging transaction fees.

234
0:13:04.36,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So it's a pretty exciting way,

235
0:13:05.84,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when they were thinking about how to bring their capabilities

236
0:13:08.76,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to a need in society

237
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and at the same time drive their own growth.

238
0:13:14.76,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But what if you're trying to find new customer segments?

239
0:13:18.84,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Let's move to South Africa,

240
0:13:21.12,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and let's talk about Standard Bank.

241
0:13:23.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
In South Africa,

242
0:13:25.4,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the government has a regulation

243
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that requires all banks to donate 0.2 percent of their profits

244
0:13:32.72,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to small and medium black-owned enterprises.

245
0:13:36.6,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And many banks just donate this to the entrepreneurs,

246
0:13:40.4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but Standard Bank thought creatively.

247
0:13:42.8,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And what they did is they took those funds

248
0:13:45.48,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and they invested them in an independent trust,

249
0:13:49.08,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and they used that trust to fund loans to these black entrepreneurs.

250
0:13:54.56,000 --> 0:13:56,000
This is a highly leveraged model.

251
0:13:57.04,000 --> 0:14:,000
They can support a lot more entrepreneurs with capital,

252
0:14:00.64,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and because their success is completely intertwined

253
0:14:03.56,000 --> 0:14:05,000
with the success of the entrepreneurs,

254
0:14:06.12,000 --> 0:14:09,000
they're actually also using the fund to provide technical assistance.

255
0:14:10.8,000 --> 0:14:12,000
More entrepreneurs supported,

256
0:14:13.24,000 --> 0:14:16,000
more people and communities being lifted out of poverty.

257
0:14:17.52,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And it's successful for Standard Bank.

258
0:14:19.76,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So successful that they're actually working on expanding this program

259
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to other areas in their portfolio.

260
0:14:27.92,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It's not like we haven't been trying to solve the problems in our world

261
0:14:31.64,000 --> 0:14:32,000
for a long time.

262
0:14:33.36,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We have, and they're still here.

263
0:14:36.6,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We're making progress,

264
0:14:38.56,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but it's not far enough,

265
0:14:40.48,000 --> 0:14:41,000
or fast enough,

266
0:14:41.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or universal enough.

267
0:14:44.12,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We need to flip our thinking.

268
0:14:47.08,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We need to have business --

269
0:14:49.24,000 --> 0:14:52,000
both companies and investors --

270
0:14:53.2,000 --> 0:14:58,000
bring creative, innovative corporate strategy and capital

271
0:14:59.2,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to solving the biggest problems in our world.

272
0:15:03.6,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And when they do that innovatively,

273
0:15:08.24,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and when they do that

274
0:15:11.12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
with all of their thinking and all of their strategy

275
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and all of their capital,

276
0:15:16.24,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and they're creating both total shareholder returns

277
0:15:19.32,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and total societal impact,

278
0:15:21.88,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we know that we will solve those problems,

279
0:15:24.84,000 --> 0:15:27,000
both profitably and generously.

280
0:15:28.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you.

281
0:15:29.96,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.54,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi, I'm an engineer

2
0:00:13.98,000 --> 0:00:14,000
and I make robots.

3
0:00:15.98,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, of course you all know what a robot is, right?

4
0:00:19.5,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,

5
0:00:21.7,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and you'd ask Google what a robot is.

6
0:00:23.58,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So let's do that.

7
0:00:25.46,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We'll go to Google and this is what we get.

8
0:00:28.22,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, you can see here there are lots of different types of robots,

9
0:00:31.42,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but they're predominantly humanoid in structure.

10
0:00:35.18,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And they look pretty conventional

11
0:00:36.86,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because they've got plastic, they've got metal,

12
0:00:39.34,000 --> 0:00:41,000
they've got motors and gears and so on.

13
0:00:41.66,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Some of them look quite friendly,

14
0:00:43.3,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and you could go up and you could hug them.

15
0:00:45.38,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Some of them not so friendly,

16
0:00:46.82,000 --> 0:00:48,000
they look like they're straight out of "Terminator,"

17
0:00:49.3,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in fact they may well be straight out of "Terminator."

18
0:00:51.86,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You can do lots of really cool things with these robots --

19
0:00:54.62,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you can do really exciting stuff.

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I'd like to look at different kinds of robots --

21
0:00:59.22,000 --> 0:01:,000
I want to make different kinds of robots.

22
0:01:01.22,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I take inspiration from the things that don't look like us,

23
0:01:04.66,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but look like these.

24
0:01:06.5,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So these are natural biological organisms

25
0:01:09.1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and they do some really cool things that we can't,

26
0:01:11.7,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and current robots can't either.

27
0:01:14.22,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor;

28
0:01:17.42,000 --> 0:01:19,000
they go into our gardens and they eat our crops;

29
0:01:19.7,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they climb trees;

30
0:01:20.98,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they go in water, they come out of water;

31
0:01:23.22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
they trap insects and digest them.

32
0:01:25.82,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So they do really interesting things.

33
0:01:27.66,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They live, they breathe, they die,

34
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they eat things from the environment.

35
0:01:32.9,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Our current robots don't really do that.

36
0:01:35.5,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, wouldn't it be great

37
0:01:36.74,000 --> 0:01:39,000
if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots

38
0:01:40.42,000 --> 0:01:42,000
so that you could solve some really interesting problems?

39
0:01:43.14,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'm going to look at a couple of problems now in the environment

40
0:01:46.22,000 --> 0:01:48,000
where we can use the skills and the technologies

41
0:01:48.98,000 --> 0:01:5,000
derived from these animals

42
0:01:51.02,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and from the plants,

43
0:01:52.58,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and we can use them to solve those problems.

44
0:01:54.7,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Let's have a look at two environmental problems.

45
0:01:57.78,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They're both of our making --

46
0:01:59.22,000 --> 0:02:01,000
this is man interacting with the environment

47
0:02:01.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and doing some rather unpleasant things.

48
0:02:04.1,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The first one is to do with the pressure of population.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Such is the pressure of population around the world

50
0:02:10.7,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops.

51
0:02:14.86,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now, to do that,

52
0:02:16.1,000 --> 0:02:18,000
farmers put more and more chemicals onto the land.

53
0:02:18.5,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They put on fertilizers, nitrates, pesticides --

54
0:02:21.66,000 --> 0:02:24,000
all sorts of things that encourage the growth of the crops,

55
0:02:25.06,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but there are some negative impacts.

56
0:02:27.22,000 --> 0:02:3,000
One of the negative impacts is if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,

57
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:32,000
not all of it goes into the crops.

58
0:02:33.14,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Lots of it stays in the soil,

59
0:02:35.74,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then when it rains,

60
0:02:37.22,000 --> 0:02:39,000
these chemicals go into the water table.

61
0:02:39.74,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And in the water table,

62
0:02:41.02,000 --> 0:02:44,000
then they go into streams, into lakes, into rivers

63
0:02:44.54,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and into the sea.

64
0:02:46.22,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, if you put all of these chemicals, these nitrates,

65
0:02:48.86,000 --> 0:02:49,000
into those kinds of environments,

66
0:02:50.5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that --

67
0:02:54.3,000 --> 0:02:55,000
algae, for example.

68
0:02:55.94,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,

69
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
so it will take in all these chemicals,

70
0:03:00.62,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and if the conditions are right, it will mass produce.

71
0:03:03.58,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It will produce masses and masses of new algae.

72
0:03:05.86,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's called a bloom.

73
0:03:07.42,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The trouble is that when algae reproduces like this,

74
0:03:10.62,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it starves the water of oxygen.

75
0:03:13.3,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As soon as you do that,

76
0:03:14.58,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the other organisms in the water can't survive.

77
0:03:17.9,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, what do we do?

78
0:03:19.94,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We try to produce a robot that will eat the algae,

79
0:03:23.98,000 --> 0:03:24,000
consume it and make it safe.

80
0:03:25.86,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So that's the first problem.

81
0:03:27.78,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The second problem is also of our making,

82
0:03:30.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and it's to do with oil pollution.

83
0:03:32.62,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Now, oil comes out of the engines that we use,

84
0:03:36.38,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the boats that we use.

85
0:03:37.74,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea,

86
0:03:40.82,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so oil is released into the sea that way.

87
0:03:43.1,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Wouldn't it be nice if we could treat that in some way

88
0:03:45.7,000 --> 0:03:49,000
using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have produced?

89
0:03:50.98,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So that's what we do.

90
0:03:52.62,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We make robots that will eat pollution.

91
0:03:55.7,000 --> 0:03:56,000
To actually make the robot,

92
0:03:57.06,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we take inspiration from two organisms.

93
0:04:00.1,000 --> 0:04:02,000
On the right there you see the basking shark.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The basking shark is a massive shark.

95
0:04:04.82,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's noncarnivorous, so you can swim with it,

96
0:04:07.42,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as you can see.

97
0:04:08.9,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And the basking shark opens its mouth,

98
0:04:10.78,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it swims through the water, collecting plankton.

99
0:04:14.7,000 --> 0:04:16,000
As it does that, it digests the food,

100
0:04:16.94,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving.

101
0:04:21.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So, could we make a robot like that --

102
0:04:23.1,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like the basking shark that chugs through the water

103
0:04:25.66,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and eats up pollution?

104
0:04:27.98,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Well, let's see if we can do that.

105
0:04:29.74,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But also, we take the inspiration from other organisms.

106
0:04:32.82,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I've got a picture here of a water boatman,

107
0:04:34.9,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the water boatman is really cute.

108
0:04:36.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When it's swimming in the water,

109
0:04:38.34,000 --> 0:04:4,000
it uses its paddle-like legs to push itself forward.

110
0:04:41.42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So we take those two organisms

111
0:04:43.46,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot.

112
0:04:47.14,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In fact, because we're using the water boatman as inspiration,

113
0:04:50.34,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and our robot sits on top of the water,

114
0:04:53.14,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and it rows,

115
0:04:54.42,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we call it the "Row-bot."

116
0:04:56.66,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.

117
0:05:00.54,000 --> 0:05:02,000
OK. So what does it look like?

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,

119
0:05:05.02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and you'll see,

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it doesn't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning.

121
0:05:09.62,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Google is wrong; robots don't look like that,

122
0:05:11.78,000 --> 0:05:12,000
they look like this.

123
0:05:13.02,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I've got the Row-bot here.

124
0:05:14.82,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I'll just hold it up for you.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It gives you a sense of the scale,

126
0:05:17.94,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it doesn't look anything like the others.

127
0:05:20.1,000 --> 0:05:21,000
OK, so it's made out of plastic,

128
0:05:21.74,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and we'll have a look now at the components

129
0:05:23.82,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that make up the Row-bot --

130
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
what makes it really special.

131
0:05:27.58,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The Row-bot is made up of three parts,

132
0:05:30.42,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and those three parts are really like the parts of any organism.

133
0:05:33.74,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's got a brain,

134
0:05:35.42,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it's got a body

135
0:05:36.82,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and it's got a stomach.

136
0:05:39.14,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It needs the stomach to create the energy.

137
0:05:41.58,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Any Row-bot will have those three components,

138
0:05:43.82,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and any organism will have those three components,

139
0:05:46.22,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so let's go through them one at a time.

140
0:05:48.14,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It has a body,

141
0:05:49.42,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and its body is made out of plastic,

142
0:05:51.22,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and it sits on top of the water.

143
0:05:53.46,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And it's got flippers on the side here --

144
0:05:56.42,000 --> 0:05:57,000
paddles that help it move,

145
0:05:57.94,000 --> 0:05:58,000
just like the water boatman.

146
0:06:00.02,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's got a plastic body,

147
0:06:01.38,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and a mouth here -- it's got two mouths.

149
0:06:06.18,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Why does it have two mouths?

150
0:06:07.62,000 --> 0:06:08,000
One is to let the food go in

151
0:06:09.46,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and the other is to let the food go out.

152
0:06:11.42,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So you can see really it's got a mouth and a derriere,

153
0:06:14.94,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or a --

154
0:06:16.18,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:17.22,000 --> 0:06:18,000
something where the stuff comes out,

156
0:06:18.98,000 --> 0:06:19,000
which is just like a real organism.

157
0:06:20.7,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So it's starting to look like that basking shark.

158
0:06:23.54,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So that's the body.

159
0:06:24.94,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The second component might be the stomach.

160
0:06:28.1,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution,

161
0:06:32.02,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so the pollution goes in,

162
0:06:33.58,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it will do something.

163
0:06:35.1,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell.

164
0:06:38.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I'll put this down, and I'll lift up the fuel cell.

165
0:06:42.02,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Here. So instead of having batteries,

166
0:06:43.9,000 --> 0:06:45,000
instead of having a conventional power system,

167
0:06:46.1,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's got one of these.

168
0:06:47.38,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is its stomach.

169
0:06:48.66,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And it really is a stomach

170
0:06:49.94,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution,

171
0:06:53.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and it creates electricity.

172
0:06:55.06,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So what is it?

173
0:06:56.3,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's called a microbial fuel cell.

174
0:06:57.98,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's a little bit like a chemical fuel cell,

175
0:07:00.1,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which you might have come across in school,

176
0:07:02.14,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or you might've seen in the news.

177
0:07:03.78,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Chemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen,

178
0:07:05.94,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they can combine them together and you get electricity.

179
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:11,000
That's well-established technology; it was in the Apollo space missions.

180
0:07:12.22,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's from 40, 50 years ago.

181
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is slightly newer.

182
0:07:15.54,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This is a microbial fuel cell.

183
0:07:17.02,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's the same principle:

184
0:07:18.3,000 --> 0:07:19,000
it's got oxygen on one side,

185
0:07:19.74,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but instead of having hydrogen on the other,

186
0:07:21.86,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's got some soup,

187
0:07:23.18,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and inside that soup there are living microbes.

188
0:07:26.02,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, if you take some organic material --

189
0:07:28.74,000 --> 0:07:3,000
could be some waste products, some food,

190
0:07:31.1,000 --> 0:07:32,000
maybe a bit of your sandwich --

191
0:07:32.62,000 --> 0:07:34,000
you put it in there, the microbes will eat that food,

192
0:07:35.46,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they will turn it into electricity.

193
0:07:38.22,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Not only that, but if you select the right kind of microbes,

194
0:07:41.74,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution.

195
0:07:46.22,000 --> 0:07:47,000
If you choose the right microbes,

196
0:07:47.86,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the microbes will eat the algae.

197
0:07:50.5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If you use other kinds of microbes,

198
0:07:52.86,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they will eat petroleum spirits and crude oil.

199
0:07:56.78,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So you can see how this stomach could be used

200
0:07:59.5,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to not only treat the pollution

201
0:08:02.78,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but also to generate electricity from the pollution.

202
0:08:06.22,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So the robot will move through the environment,

203
0:08:09.02,000 --> 0:08:11,000
taking food into its stomach,

204
0:08:11.14,000 --> 0:08:13,000
digest the food, create electricity,

205
0:08:13.66,000 --> 0:08:15,000
use that electricity to move through the environment

206
0:08:16.18,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and keep doing this.

207
0:08:17.42,000 --> 0:08:2,000
OK, so let's see what happens when we run the Row-bot --

208
0:08:20.98,000 --> 0:08:21,000
when it does some rowing.

209
0:08:22.38,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Here we've got a couple of videos,

210
0:08:24.06,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the first thing you'll see -- hopefully you can see here

211
0:08:26.74,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is the mouth open.

212
0:08:28.06,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,

213
0:08:31.1,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and it will stay opened enough,

214
0:08:32.66,000 --> 0:08:34,000
then the robot will start to row forward.

215
0:08:34.7,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It moves through the water

216
0:08:35.98,000 --> 0:08:38,000
so that food goes in as the waste products go out.

217
0:08:39.1,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Once it's moved enough,

218
0:08:40.38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it stops and then it closes the mouth --

219
0:08:43.34,000 --> 0:08:45,000
slowly closes the mouths --

220
0:08:45.78,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then it will sit there,

221
0:08:47.46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and it will digest the food.

222
0:08:49.82,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Of course these microbial fuel cells,

223
0:08:52.54,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they contain microbes.

224
0:08:53.82,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What you really want is lots of energy

225
0:08:55.7,000 --> 0:08:57,000
coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible.

226
0:08:58.34,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But we can't force the microbes

227
0:08:59.94,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and they generate a small amount of electricity per second.

228
0:09:02.98,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.

229
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Let's put that into context.

230
0:09:08.14,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Your mobile phone for example,

231
0:09:09.7,000 --> 0:09:1,000
one of these modern ones,

232
0:09:11.1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
if you use it, it takes about one watt.

233
0:09:13.34,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So that's a thousand or a million times as much energy that that uses

234
0:09:17.18,000 --> 0:09:18,000
compared to the microbial fuel cell.

235
0:09:19.82,000 --> 0:09:2,000
How can we cope with that?

236
0:09:21.42,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Well, when the Row-bot has done its digestion,

237
0:09:24.3,000 --> 0:09:25,000
when it's taken the food in,

238
0:09:25.78,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food.

239
0:09:29.34,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That could take some hours, it could take some days.

240
0:09:32.58,000 --> 0:09:35,000
A typical cycle for the Row-bot looks like this:

241
0:09:36.3,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you open your mouth,

242
0:09:37.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you move,

243
0:09:38.86,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you close your mouth

244
0:09:40.14,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and you sit there for a while waiting.

245
0:09:42.02,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Once you digest your food,

246
0:09:43.42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
then you can go about doing the same thing again.

247
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But you know what, that looks like a real organism, doesn't it?

248
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It looks like the kind of thing we do.

249
0:09:51.14,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Saturday night, we go out, open our mouths,

250
0:09:53.22,000 --> 0:09:54,000
fill our stomachs,

251
0:09:54.78,000 --> 0:09:56,000
sit in front of the telly and digest.

252
0:09:57.74,000 --> 0:09:59,000
When we've had enough, we do the same thing again.

253
0:10:00.14,000 --> 0:10:02,000
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,

254
0:10:03.02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
at the end of the cycle we'll have enough energy left over

255
0:10:06.58,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for us to be able to do something else.

256
0:10:08.74,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We could send a message, for example.

257
0:10:10.78,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We could send a message saying,

258
0:10:12.3,000 --> 0:10:14,000
"This is how much pollution I've eaten recently,"

259
0:10:14.66,000 --> 0:10:16,000
or, "This is the kind of stuff that I've encountered,"

260
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
or, "This is where I am."

261
0:10:19.62,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That ability to send a message saying, "This is where I am,"

262
0:10:22.9,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is really, really important.

263
0:10:24.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If you think about the oil slicks that we saw before,

264
0:10:27.38,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or those massive algal blooms,

265
0:10:28.86,000 --> 0:10:3,000
what you really want to do is put your Row-bot out there,

266
0:10:31.58,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and it eats up all of those pollutions,

267
0:10:33.58,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and then you have to go collect them.

268
0:10:35.78,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Why?

269
0:10:37.02,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because these Row-bots at the moment,

270
0:10:38.86,000 --> 0:10:39,000
this Row-bot I've got here,

271
0:10:40.22,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it contains motors, it contains wires,

272
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable.

273
0:10:45.58,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Current Row-bots contain things like toxic batteries.

274
0:10:48.34,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You can't leave those in the environment,

275
0:10:50.34,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so you need to track them,

276
0:10:51.86,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and then when they've finished their job of work,

277
0:10:54.22,000 --> 0:10:55,000
you need to collect them.

278
0:10:55.5,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That limits the number of Row-bots you can use.

279
0:10:57.86,000 --> 0:10:58,000
If, on the other hand,

280
0:10:59.14,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you have robot a little bit like a biological organism,

281
0:11:02.3,000 --> 0:11:04,000
when it comes to the end of its life,

282
0:11:04.42,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it dies and it degrades to nothing.

283
0:11:06.9,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,

284
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
instead of being like this, made out of plastic,

285
0:11:11.523,000 --> 0:11:12,000
were made out of other materials,

286
0:11:13.14,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which when you throw them out there,

287
0:11:14.9,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they biodegrade to nothing?

288
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That changes the way in which we use robots.

289
0:11:18.38,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Instead of putting 10 or 100 out into the environment,

290
0:11:21.78,000 --> 0:11:22,000
having to track them,

291
0:11:23.06,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and then when they die,

292
0:11:24.42,000 --> 0:11:25,000
collect them,

293
0:11:25.66,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you could put a thousand,

294
0:11:27.38,000 --> 0:11:29,000
a million, a billion robots into the environment.

295
0:11:30.14,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Just spread them around.

296
0:11:31.98,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You know that at the end of their lives, they're going to degrade to nothing.

297
0:11:35.62,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You don't need to worry about them.

298
0:11:37.34,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So that changes the way in which you think about robots

299
0:11:39.98,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the way you deploy them.

300
0:11:41.38,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Then the question is: Can you do this?

301
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Well, yes, we have shown that you can do this.

302
0:11:45.46,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You can make robots which are biodegradable.

303
0:11:47.58,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What's really interesting is you can use household materials

304
0:11:50.46,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to make these biodegradable robots.

305
0:11:52.18,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I'll show you some; you might be surprised.

306
0:11:54.78,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You can make a robot out of jelly.

307
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Instead of having a motor, which we have at the moment,

308
0:12:00.5,000 --> 0:12:02,000
you can make things called artificial muscles.

309
0:12:02.98,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Artificial muscles are smart materials,

310
0:12:05.3,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you apply electricity to them,

311
0:12:06.78,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and they contract, or they bend or they twist.

312
0:12:08.98,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They look like real muscles.

313
0:12:11.22,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So instead of having a motor, you have these artificial muscles.

314
0:12:14.244,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And you can make artificial muscles out of jelly.

315
0:12:17.1,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you take some jelly and some salts,

316
0:12:19.06,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,

317
0:12:20.66,000 --> 0:12:21,000
you can make an artificial muscle.

318
0:12:22.46,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell's stomach

319
0:12:26.06,000 --> 0:12:27,000
out of paper.

320
0:12:27.5,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials.

321
0:12:31.3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
You throw them out there, and they degrade to nothing.

322
0:12:35.42,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Well, this is really, really exciting.

323
0:12:37.3,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots,

324
0:12:40.515,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but also it allows you to be really creative

325
0:12:42.78,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots.

326
0:12:46.14,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I'll give you an example.

327
0:12:47.42,000 --> 0:12:49,000
If you can use jelly to make a robot --

328
0:12:50.02,000 --> 0:12:51,000
now, we eat jelly, right?

329
0:12:51.94,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, why not make something like this?

330
0:12:54.46,000 --> 0:12:55,000
A robot gummy bear.

331
0:12:56.94,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.

332
0:12:59.74,000 --> 0:13:,000
There we go. I've got a packet --

333
0:13:02.38,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I've got a lemon-flavored one.

334
0:13:05.42,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I'll take this gummy bear -- he's not robotic, OK?

335
0:13:08.18,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We have to pretend.

336
0:13:09.42,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And what you do with one of these is you put it in your mouth --

337
0:13:12.46,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the lemon's quite nice.

338
0:13:14.54,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Try not to chew it too much, it's a robot, it may not like it.

339
0:13:18.66,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And then you swallow it.

340
0:13:20.9,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And then it goes into your stomach.

341
0:13:22.62,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And when it's inside your stomach, it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,

342
0:13:26.46,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it does something.

343
0:13:27.7,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It could go further down into your intestines,

344
0:13:29.9,000 --> 0:13:31,000
find out whether you've got some ulcer or cancer,

345
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
maybe do an injection, something like that.

346
0:13:34.38,000 --> 0:13:36,000
You know that once it's done its job of work,

347
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
it could be consumed by your stomach,

348
0:13:39.5,000 --> 0:13:4,000
or if you don't want that,

349
0:13:41.22,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it could go straight through you,

350
0:13:42.86,000 --> 0:13:43,000
into the toilet,

351
0:13:44.1,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and be degraded safely in the environment.

352
0:13:46.34,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So this changes the way, again, in which we think about robots.

353
0:13:50.54,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So, we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution,

354
0:13:54.86,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and then we're looking at robots which we can eat.

355
0:13:57.54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I hope this gives you some idea

356
0:13:59.22,000 --> 0:14:01,000
of the kinds of things we can do with future robots.

357
0:14:03.38,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you very much for your attention.

358
0:14:05.3,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause)

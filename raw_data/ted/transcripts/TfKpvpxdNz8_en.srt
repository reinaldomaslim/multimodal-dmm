1
0:00:13.103,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Alright, I want to tell you how I got my superpowers through fatherhood.

2
0:00:18.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was working a job I hated, OK?

3
0:00:20.831,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I don't know if anyone here ever worked a job they hated.

4
0:00:23.737,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Has anyone here ever worked a job they hated?

5
0:00:25.864,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:26.889,000 --> 0:00:27,000
OK, good, because I'm not alone

7
0:00:28.609,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I have something to confess; I don't want you guys to judge me.

8
0:00:31.776,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This feels like a safe space, is it a safe space?

9
0:00:34.157,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Audience: Yes.

10
0:00:35.339,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Glen Henry: OK, I was working the job I hated,

11
0:00:37.529,000 --> 0:00:38,000
my manager and I were not getting along.

12
0:00:39.475,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was sitting in my car, looking in the rearview mirror,

13
0:00:42.167,000 --> 0:00:45,000
trying to figure out which friend I could call

14
0:00:45.736,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to call in a bomb threat,

15
0:00:46.959,000 --> 0:00:48,000
so I didn't have to go back in the building.

16
0:00:49.046,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:50.071,000 --> 0:00:52,000
OK, this was having a lot of issues for me,

18
0:00:53.062,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was having a lot of issues at my job

19
0:00:54.91,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I'd come home every day from work

20
0:00:56.696,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and my wife would ask me the same question.

21
0:00:59.458,000 --> 0:01:,000
And when you hate your job,

22
0:01:00.792,000 --> 0:01:02,000
this is the worst question anyone could ask you.

23
0:01:03.323,000 --> 0:01:05,000
She'd say, "Hey babe, how was your day?"

24
0:01:06.307,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:08.069,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I'd say,

26
0:01:09.261,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"Why you bringing up old stuff?"

27
0:01:10.855,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:11.88,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I just left it, I don't want to think about that place again.

29
0:01:15.879,000 --> 0:01:18,000
See, we were spending about 40 percent of my income on childcare.

30
0:01:19.315,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We had one child.

31
0:01:21.354,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And we were pregnant with our second child.

32
0:01:23.688,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And we were trying to figure out how we were going to fix this whole thing

33
0:01:27.212,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of this money situation, and she said,

34
0:01:29.061,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"Hey, babe, I've got a great idea."

35
0:01:31.521,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I said, "What's up?"

36
0:01:32.879,000 --> 0:01:34,000
She said, "I think you'd be a great stay-at-home dad."

37
0:01:35.506,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:37.236,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was like, "Why would you say something like that?"

39
0:01:39.696,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:40.721,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She said, "Because babies like you."

41
0:01:42.99,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:44.522,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was like, "No, they don't."

43
0:01:45.935,000 --> 0:01:46,000
She was like, "No, they do like you.

44
0:01:47.697,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I think it would be great

45
0:01:49.379,000 --> 0:01:52,000
for our children to see what love looks like, coming from a father."

46
0:01:54.143,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was like, OK.

47
0:01:55.587,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

48
0:01:58.071,000 --> 0:02:,000
So, I had issues with this,

49
0:02:00.651,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because I haven't seen a lot of stay-at-home dads before

50
0:02:03.326,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I thought men would judge me, so get this, I said this --

51
0:02:06.569,000 --> 0:02:08,000
please don't be offended -- I said,

52
0:02:09.093,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Uh, you know, that sounds boring.

53
0:02:11.744,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And what do stay-at-home moms do all day, anyway?"

54
0:02:14.879,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Audience: Ooh!

55
0:02:18.141,000 --> 0:02:22,000
She smiled at me a smile only a woman full of knowledge can smile

56
0:02:22.402,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:23.768,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and said, "Well, this should be easy for you.

58
0:02:26.657,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it will save us some money, it seems like a no-brainer."

59
0:02:29.506,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:30.575,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Fast-forward six months,

61
0:02:32.228,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'd been a stay-at-home dad for about a week.

62
0:02:34.464,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:35.72,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was standing in my bathroom, looking into the mirror

64
0:02:39.085,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:41,000
crying, tears --

66
0:02:41.855,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

67
0:02:43.672,000 --> 0:02:44,000
running all down my face.

68
0:02:45.363,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:47.252,000 --> 0:02:5,000
My one-and-a-half-year-old was banging on the bathroom door --

70
0:02:50.577,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because I locked them out, you know --

71
0:02:52.456,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

72
0:02:53.481,000 --> 0:02:55,000
crying, tears running down his face.

73
0:02:56.252,000 --> 0:03:,000
And my newborn was in the bassinet, crying, tears running down his face.

74
0:03:00.49,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I looked at myself in the mirror, and I said ...

75
0:03:03.807,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Which friend can you call to call in a bomb threat?

76
0:03:06.326,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We've got to get out of here."

77
0:03:07.803,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:09.942,000 --> 0:03:12,000
See, I had traded my manager for my children.

79
0:03:13.173,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I didn't know what I got myself into.

80
0:03:14.996,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I thought I knew everything about being a stay-at-home parent,

81
0:03:18.402,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and in fact, I knew nothing at all.

82
0:03:21.099,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Because even though my manager was --

83
0:03:23.806,000 --> 0:03:26,000
well, at least my children were a lot cuter than my manager,

84
0:03:27.171,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they were just as demanding.

85
0:03:29.132,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Video) Child: Wipe my butt.

86
0:03:31.839,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Papa, wipe my butt.

87
0:03:34.101,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:35.331,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Wipe my butt.

89
0:03:38.133,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:45.744,000 --> 0:03:47,000
GH: What had I gotten myself into?

91
0:03:47.927,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I thought I knew everything about being a stay-at-home parent --

92
0:03:50.951,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in fact, I knew nothing.

93
0:03:52.174,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I thought that all I had to do was feed them,

94
0:03:54.674,000 --> 0:03:56,000
change their diapers, and they'd be fine.

95
0:03:56.824,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Like, I really thought that's it.

96
0:03:59.42,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"Sesame Street" on TV, keep them distracted,

97
0:04:02.087,000 --> 0:04:04,000
apple sauce in a bowl, milk in a bottle, they'd be fine.

98
0:04:05.054,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But if you leave children alone,

99
0:04:07.229,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they'll get into just a little bit of mischief.

100
0:04:09.642,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Video) Child: Hi.

101
0:04:12.951,000 --> 0:04:13,000
GH: Where is the powder?

102
0:04:15.403,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Child: I don't know.

103
0:04:17.109,000 --> 0:04:2,000
GH: Well, where did you put it, where did it --

104
0:04:21.187,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Who did it?

105
0:04:22.387,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Child 1: No, you did it! Child 2: No, you did it!

106
0:04:25.323,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Child 1: No, you did it! Child 2: No, you did it!

107
0:04:28.387,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:30.538,000 --> 0:04:33,000
GH: You know what else I thought I knew about being a stay-at-home parent?

109
0:04:34.173,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I thought that all I had to do was take them to the park once a week,

110
0:04:37.775,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because if I took them to the park once a week, they'd be fine.

111
0:04:41.633,000 --> 0:04:42,000
In fact, I knew nothing at all.

112
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:44,000
OK.

113
0:04:44.903,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If you take kids to park every day then that means they get dirty every day.

114
0:04:49.038,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If they got dirty every day, they need baths every day,

115
0:04:51.673,000 --> 0:04:53,000
if they got baths every day --

116
0:04:54.061,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I just don't think you understand, see, having two kids under two,

117
0:04:57.204,000 --> 0:05:,000
you end up changing over 20 dirty diapers a day, OK.

118
0:05:01.498,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And if you give them a bath, that's just more nakedness.

119
0:05:04.498,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:05.823,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And a higher probability of getting peed on,

121
0:05:07.99,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and no one likes getting peed on, even if it's from a baby.

122
0:05:11.011,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:12.192,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But I read this article by Father Lee

124
0:05:14.368,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which cites a survey done by two detergent companies, Omo and Persil.

125
0:05:18.717,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And they did this study and it said, that at two hours a day,

126
0:05:21.736,000 --> 0:05:23,000
prisoners get more outside time than children.

127
0:05:25.362,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That convicted me and so we went outside.

128
0:05:28.735,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Video) (Music)

129
0:05:38.465,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:41.077,000 --> 0:05:43,000
GH: See, I knew nothing about being a stay-at-home parent,

131
0:05:43.93,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and once I embraced the fact that I knew nothing,

132
0:05:46.273,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I began to learn from my new managers.

133
0:05:48.115,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I always was told

134
0:05:49.336,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that as a stay-at-home parent, you get no sleep.

135
0:05:53.202,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Or as a parent in general, you get no sleep.

136
0:05:55.307,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But that's not true, because if you sleep when they do,

137
0:05:58.22,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you actually can get some sleep.

138
0:05:59.847,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:02.376,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You know what else I thought as a stay-at-home parent?

140
0:06:05.225,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I though I knew that the best way to teach kids right from wrong

141
0:06:08.487,000 --> 0:06:09,000
was to discipline them,

142
0:06:09.665,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because that would make sure they understood right from wrong,

143
0:06:12.625,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the pain, the fear -- that would teach them.

144
0:06:14.704,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But the truth is, the best way to teach my children right from wrong

145
0:06:18.403,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is to teach them.

146
0:06:19.583,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Take out a whiteboard and draw pictures and make connections

147
0:06:22.433,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that they can understand.

148
0:06:23.918,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That was the best way.

149
0:06:26.868,000 --> 0:06:29,000
A lot of these images you're seeing are coming from my YouTube channel,

150
0:06:30.234,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Beleaf in Fatherhood."

151
0:06:31.441,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I document the misadventures of being a stay-at-home dad.

152
0:06:34.173,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And it's not perfect, it's just showing that I'm trying.

153
0:06:37.222,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And I'm not trying to be an example

154
0:06:38.985,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but just proof that it's possible for whoever else is doing this.

155
0:06:43.204,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You know what I also knew about being a stay-at-home parent?

156
0:06:46.315,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I knew that children needed love,

157
0:06:48.101,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but I just didn't know what love looked like.

158
0:06:50.268,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Video) (Music)

159
0:06:57.932,000 --> 0:06:59,000
GH: It turns out putting diapers on your head

160
0:07:00.13,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and play-fighting until the kids fall asleep

161
0:07:02.242,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is a great way to love your kids.

162
0:07:04.942,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So, I was learning a lot,

163
0:07:07.673,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but it's not all fun and boogers, is it?

164
0:07:09.688,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:11.713,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I asked a group of stay-at-home parents what's the hardest thing,

166
0:07:14.856,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the thing they underestimated most about being stay-at-home parents,

167
0:07:18.101,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they said that the loneliness was one of those things.

168
0:07:20.871,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Not having someone else to talk to, feeling inadequate,

169
0:07:23.522,000 --> 0:07:24,000
feeling selfish for wanting me-time.

170
0:07:26.03,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And nursery rhymes suck.

171
0:07:28.418,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:29.839,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Like, really, "Mary Had a Little Lamb" is cool the first couple of times,

173
0:07:33.347,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but after all these years on repeat,

174
0:07:35.848,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you wonder why Mary just ain't make herself a wool skirt

175
0:07:38.629,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and have lamb chops, you know what I'm saying?

176
0:07:40.885,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:42.442,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The one thing I underestimated most was the emotional fatigue.

178
0:07:45.561,000 --> 0:07:48,000
See, I was an artist, so I'd write songs for other artists.

179
0:07:48.649,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Because that's how I made money from home.

180
0:07:51.615,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But when you're with your kids all day, you become emotionally tired.

181
0:07:55.575,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And that means all your creativity comes from your emotions,

182
0:07:58.497,000 --> 0:07:59,000
so you’re just tapped out, you're done.

183
0:08:00.513,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So you become done with time.

184
0:08:04.366,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Nap time, time-tables, time-out, time like to cook,

185
0:08:07.423,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with all types of time, you're just done.

186
0:08:09.899,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You had no time for anything.

187
0:08:11.494,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And some people are done with their spouse as a stay-at-home parent.

188
0:08:15.193,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Because the spouse just doesn't get it.

189
0:08:18.113,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I was talking to a friend of mine, he said,

190
0:08:20.97,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"Man, I come home from work,

191
0:08:23.569,000 --> 0:08:26,000
drawers are open, clothes hanging outside the drawers,

192
0:08:27.101,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the kids are still in their pajamas ...

193
0:08:29.252,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And it can't be that hard to have dinner ready when I get home, right?"

194
0:08:32.635,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:34.596,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Start to freak out, you know what I'm saying?

196
0:08:36.747,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:38.207,000 --> 0:08:4,000
He was trying to confide in me --

198
0:08:40.358,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

199
0:08:41.547,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I said, "You have no idea what you're talking about."

200
0:08:44.048,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:46.696,000 --> 0:08:48,000
She wakes up every morning, tired from the night before,

202
0:08:49.363,000 --> 0:08:51,000
baby attached to her breast, dropping this kid off at school,

203
0:08:52.292,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and taking this one to the park.

204
0:08:53.855,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Laundry piles up to the skies,

205
0:08:55.356,000 --> 0:08:57,000
he has a conversation on the phone for an hour with your mom

206
0:08:58.19,000 --> 0:08:59,000
about God knows what,

207
0:08:59.396,000 --> 0:09:,000
takes the dog you wanted for a walk ...

208
0:09:01.403,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:02.428,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And nobody died, bro.

210
0:09:05.022,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She kept your kids alive all day, that's hard."

211
0:09:07.753,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:10.109,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I have become an advocate for stay-at-home parents.

213
0:09:13.502,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Why?

214
0:09:14.684,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Because finally, I was standing in their shoes.

215
0:09:17.898,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Because when you're standing in someone else's shoes,

216
0:09:20.399,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you see the world from a different perspective.

217
0:09:22.68,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And when you start to take steps, it feels like baby steps, wobbling.

218
0:09:26.633,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But then they turn into stomps.

219
0:09:28.847,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And you start making footprints for the next generation to walk in.

220
0:09:33.085,000 --> 0:09:35,000
See, we're walking on a certain path, as parents.

221
0:09:35.601,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We're all in this together.

222
0:09:36.934,000 --> 0:09:38,000
No one can deny that family is one of the biggest foundations

223
0:09:39.864,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in anyone's life.

224
0:09:41.046,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And we're all walking on this path,

225
0:09:42.756,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we're pulling these thickets out of the way, and these thorns,

226
0:09:46.346,000 --> 0:09:48,000
making it easier for the ones coming after us.

227
0:09:48.53,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It turns out, parenting has a lot more to do with landscaping.

228
0:09:53.204,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And learning.

229
0:09:54.931,000 --> 0:09:55,000
More than teaching.

230
0:09:58.201,000 --> 0:10:,000
And the best thing to do is to show up for class.

231
0:10:01.622,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Be present is what I learned as a stay-at-home dad.

232
0:10:06.19,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And let your presence be a gift.

233
0:10:08.372,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Video) Shh.

234
0:10:09.952,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Door unlocking)

235
0:10:15.306,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Hi!

236
0:10:16.792,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Children giggling)

237
0:10:19.022,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:22.996,000 --> 0:10:24,000
GH: This was me, coming home from tour one day.

239
0:10:25.769,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I thought that the father was supposed to pursue the child.

240
0:10:29.785,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But it turns out the father makes himself present.

241
0:10:33.144,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And the children run after him.

242
0:10:35.429,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And that right there is a superpower.

243
0:10:38.683,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that right there, my friends, is everything.

244
0:10:41.477,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Thank you.

245
0:10:42.652,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

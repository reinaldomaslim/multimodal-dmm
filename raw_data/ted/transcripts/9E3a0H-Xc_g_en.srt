0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a newspaper article which said

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that one day syringes would be

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the transmission of AIDS.

6
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
kills approximately one million people a year.

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and kills 1.3 million people a year.

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This young girl and her friend

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that I met in an orphanage in Delhi

13
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
were HIV positive from a syringe.

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And what was so sad about this particular story

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was that once their parents had found out --

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the parents threw them out on the street.

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And hence they ended up in an orphanage.

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And it comes from situations like this where

20
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
blindly giving an injection to someone.

22
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And the injection is so valuable,

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that the people basically trust

24
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
between people in high-virus areas.

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This video we took undercover,

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which shows you, over a half an hour period,

30
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a tray of medicines of 42 vials,

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.

32
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was filmed being unwrapped.

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They started with two and they ended with two.

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,

36
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which is their sort of modular station,

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and dropping the syringe she's just used

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of all injections given

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
are unsafe.

43
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

44
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They are lucky. They already have a job.

45
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes

46
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
from the back of hospitals,

47
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
wash them, and in the course of this,

48
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.

49
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets

50
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for literally more money

51
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.

52
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,

53
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --

54
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --

55
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,

56
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,

57
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
giving me full assurance

58
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.

59
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In China, recycling is a major issue.

60
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --

61
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,

62
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and then put back out on the street.

63
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So recycling and reuse

64
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
are the major issues here.

65
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.

66
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In all schools in Indonesia,

67
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
there is usually a toy seller in the playground.

68
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The toy seller, in this case,

69
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
had syringes, which they usually do,

70
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
next door to the diggers, which is obviously

71
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
what you would expect.

72
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.

73
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.

74
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And they are having great fun.

75
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But they also drink from them

76
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.

77
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And they squirt the water into their mouths.

78
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And these are used with traces of blood visible.

79
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So we need a better product. And we need better information.

80
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,

81
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I was going to show you my invention,

82
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
which I came up with.

83
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.

84
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You load it up in the normal way. This is made

85
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.

86
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You give the injection and then put it down.

87
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If someone then tries to reuse it,

88
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it locks and breaks afterwards.

89
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's very, very simple. Thank you.

90
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And it costs the same as a normal syringe.

92
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And in comparison, a Coca-Cola

93
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is 10 times the price.

94
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.

95
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I have an information charity

96
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which has done huge scale amount of work in India.

97
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And we're very proud of giving information to people,

98
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.

99
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Thank you very much.

100
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

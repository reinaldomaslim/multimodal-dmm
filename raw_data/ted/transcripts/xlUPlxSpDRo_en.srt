1
0:00:12.66,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to introduce you to some very wise kids that I've known,

2
0:00:17.3,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but first I want to introduce you to a camel.

3
0:00:20.54,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is Cassie, a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients

4
0:00:24.82,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in her room,

5
0:00:26.74,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is pretty magical.

6
0:00:29.7,000 --> 0:00:33,000
A friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

7
0:00:34.86,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He has about eight of them,

8
0:00:36.54,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and he started 30 years ago

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because he thought horses were too mundane.

10
0:00:41.22,000 --> 0:00:44,000
John is an out-of-the-box thinker,

11
0:00:44.62,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which explains why the two of us have been such good friends

12
0:00:47.46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
all of our lives.

13
0:00:50.02,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Over the years, I've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts

14
0:00:55.18,000 --> 0:00:57,000
up to hang out with our sick kids from time to time.

15
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn

16
0:01:01.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that camels have an average life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.

17
0:01:07.42,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The life expectancy of many of the children with whom I work

18
0:01:10.94,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is less than a year.

19
0:01:13.34,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is a picture of the George Mark Children's House,

20
0:01:16.419,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the first pediatric palliative respite care center

21
0:01:19.94,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to open in the United States.

22
0:01:22.22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I founded it in 2004,

23
0:01:25.22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
after years of working as a psychologist

24
0:01:28.18,000 --> 0:01:3,000
on pediatric intensive care units,

25
0:01:30.9,000 --> 0:01:35,000
frustrated with the undignified deaths that so many children experienced

26
0:01:35.94,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and their families had to endure.

27
0:01:38.78,000 --> 0:01:42,000
As I sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives,

28
0:01:42.98,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was acutely aware of our surroundings.

29
0:01:46.66,000 --> 0:01:5,000
While the elevated train rumbled overhead on its track,

30
0:01:50.7,000 --> 0:01:54,000
quite literally the room reverberated with each passing train car.

31
0:01:56.3,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright.

32
0:01:59.7,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,

33
0:02:02.94,000 --> 0:02:04,000
noisily announcing its arrival.

34
0:02:05.7,000 --> 0:02:06,000
These families were experiencing

35
0:02:07.7,000 --> 0:02:1,000
some of the most excruciating moments of their lives,

36
0:02:11.34,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I so wanted them to have a more peaceful place

37
0:02:14.94,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in which to say a last goodbye to their young daughters and sons.

38
0:02:19.3,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Surely, I thought,

39
0:02:21.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
there must be a better spot than a hospital intensive care unit

40
0:02:25.42,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for children at the end of their lives.

41
0:02:28.54,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Our children's house

42
0:02:31.34,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is calm and nurturing.

43
0:02:33.86,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's a place where families can stay together

44
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to enjoy quality time with their children,

45
0:02:39.1,000 --> 0:02:41,000
many of whom are there for respite stays,

46
0:02:41.86,000 --> 0:02:44,000
some with repeated visits over a span of many years.

47
0:02:45.42,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We call those kids our frequent flyers.

48
0:02:50.18,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Rather than the bright, noisy quarters of the hospital,

49
0:02:53.62,000 --> 0:02:55,000
their rooms are calm and comfortable,

50
0:02:56.46,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with actual living spaces for the families,

51
0:02:59.74,000 --> 0:03:,000
a sanctuary of gardens

52
0:03:01.54,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and a wonderful outdoor playground

53
0:03:04.06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with special structures for children with physical limitations.

54
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This sweet baby Lars

55
0:03:11.22,000 --> 0:03:14,000
came to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit.

56
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news

57
0:03:19.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that none of us would ever want to hear.

58
0:03:22.18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
His parents had been told that Lars had a brain anomaly

59
0:03:25.94,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that would keep him from ever swallowing,

60
0:03:28.78,000 --> 0:03:29,000
walking, talking

61
0:03:30.7,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or developing mentally.

62
0:03:33.3,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Recognizing what little chance he had for survival,

63
0:03:36.3,000 --> 0:03:39,000
his parents chose to focus on the quality of time

64
0:03:39.38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that they could spend together.

65
0:03:41.42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They moved into one of our family apartments

66
0:03:44.02,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and treasured each day that they had,

67
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which were far too few.

68
0:03:48.82,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Lars's life was brief, to be sure,

69
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:52,000
mere weeks,

70
0:03:53.34,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but it was calm and comfortable.

71
0:03:55.9,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He went on hikes with his parents.

72
0:03:58.74,000 --> 0:04:,000
The time that he spent in the pool with our aquatic therapist

73
0:04:01.74,000 --> 0:04:03,000
lessened the seizures he was experiencing

74
0:04:03.94,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and helped him to sleep at night.

75
0:04:06.14,000 --> 0:04:08,000
His family had a peaceful place

76
0:04:08.22,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in which to both celebrate his life

77
0:04:10.62,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and mourn his death.

78
0:04:12.86,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It has been five years since Lars was with us,

79
0:04:16.1,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and in that time,

80
0:04:18.02,000 --> 0:04:2,000
his family has welcomed

81
0:04:20.38,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a daughter and another son.

82
0:04:23.1,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They are such a powerful testament

83
0:04:26.06,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to the positive outcome that specialized children's hospice care can create.

84
0:04:31.46,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Their baby's physical discomfort was well managed,

85
0:04:34.14,000 --> 0:04:38,000
giving all of them the gift of time to be together in a beautiful place.

86
0:04:40.1,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I'm going to talk to you now

87
0:04:42.14,000 --> 0:04:43,000
about the elephant

88
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:44,000
rather than the camel in the room.

89
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Very few people want to talk about death,

90
0:04:50.42,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and even fewer about children's death.

91
0:04:57.5,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Loss of a child,

92
0:04:59.9,000 --> 0:05:01,000
especially for those of us who have our own children,

93
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is frightening,

94
0:05:04.62,000 --> 0:05:05,000
more than frightening,

95
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:07,000
paralyzing,

96
0:05:08.74,000 --> 0:05:09,000
debilitating,

97
0:05:10.74,000 --> 0:05:11,000
impossible.

98
0:05:13.14,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But what I've learned is this:

99
0:05:15.42,000 --> 0:05:17,000
children don't stop dying

100
0:05:17.46,000 --> 0:05:18,000
just because we the adults

101
0:05:19.46,000 --> 0:05:21,000
can't comprehend the injustice of losing them.

102
0:05:22.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And what's more,

103
0:05:25.34,000 --> 0:05:26,000
if we can be brave enough

104
0:05:27.14,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to face the possibility of death,

105
0:05:29.02,000 --> 0:05:3,000
even among the most innocent,

106
0:05:31.94,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.

107
0:05:36.06,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Take Crystal, for example.

108
0:05:39.38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She was one of the first children to come for care

109
0:05:41.78,000 --> 0:05:42,000
after we opened our doors.

110
0:05:44.1,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She was nine when she arrived,

111
0:05:45.78,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and her neurologist expected that she might live another two weeks.

112
0:05:50.14,000 --> 0:05:52,000
She had an inoperable brain tumor,

113
0:05:52.66,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and her decline had really accelerated

114
0:05:55.42,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the week before she came to us.

115
0:05:58.06,000 --> 0:05:59,000
After settling into her room,

116
0:06:00.06,000 --> 0:06:03,000
dressed entirely in pink and lavender,

117
0:06:03.82,000 --> 0:06:07,000
surrounded by the Hello Kitty accessories that she loved,

118
0:06:07.94,000 --> 0:06:09,000
she spent the next several days

119
0:06:10.7,000 --> 0:06:12,000
winning over the hearts of every staff member.

120
0:06:14.58,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,

121
0:06:17.78,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and then to our astonishment,

122
0:06:20.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
she actually improved.

123
0:06:22.98,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There were a variety of factors

124
0:06:24.66,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that contributed to Crystal's improvement

125
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which we later came to call the "George Mark bump,"

126
0:06:32.94,000 --> 0:06:34,000
a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon

127
0:06:35.82,000 --> 0:06:37,000
where children outlive the prognoses of their illnesses

128
0:06:38.74,000 --> 0:06:39,000
if they're outside of the hospital.

129
0:06:42.1,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,

130
0:06:46.34,000 --> 0:06:5,000
tasty meals that were fixed often to accommodate her requests,

131
0:06:51.18,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the resident pets,

132
0:06:53.46,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the therapy dog and rabbit spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.

133
0:06:58.98,000 --> 0:07:,000
After she had been with us for about a week,

134
0:07:01.94,000 --> 0:07:02,000
she called her grandmother,

135
0:07:03.86,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and she said,

136
0:07:05.3,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,

137
0:07:08.94,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and there's room for you to come, too.

138
0:07:11.9,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And guess what?

139
0:07:13.58,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You don't have to bring any quarters

140
0:07:15.62,000 --> 0:07:17,000
because the washer and dryer are free."

141
0:07:17.9,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:20.1,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Crystal's grandmother soon arrived from out of town,

143
0:07:22.98,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and they spent the remaining four months of Crystal's life

144
0:07:27.54,000 --> 0:07:29,000
enjoying very special days together.

145
0:07:30.02,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Some days were special because Crystal was outside in her wheelchair

146
0:07:34.02,000 --> 0:07:35,000
sitting by the fountain.

147
0:07:35.86,000 --> 0:07:39,000
For a little girl who had spent most of the year earlier in a hospital bed,

148
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
being outside counting hummingbirds

149
0:07:43.22,000 --> 0:07:45,000
made for an amazing time with her grandma,

150
0:07:45.58,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and lots of laughter.

151
0:07:47.46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Other days were special because of the activities

152
0:07:50.02,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that our child life specialist created for her.

153
0:07:53.66,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Crystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house.

154
0:07:57.86,000 --> 0:08:,000
She painted a pumpkin to help decorate for Halloween.

155
0:08:02.18,000 --> 0:08:06,000
She spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday,

156
0:08:06.54,000 --> 0:08:08,000
which of course none of us thought she would ever see.

157
0:08:10.82,000 --> 0:08:13,000
All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,

158
0:08:13.98,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and Crystal, as you can see,

159
0:08:16.54,000 --> 0:08:17,000
queen for a day,

160
0:08:17.78,000 --> 0:08:18,000
wore a sparkly tiara.

161
0:08:20.46,000 --> 0:08:21,000
One hot morning, I arrived at work

162
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and Crystal and her partner in crime, Charlie, greeted me.

163
0:08:27.74,000 --> 0:08:3,000
With some help, they had set up a lemonade and cookie stand

164
0:08:30.9,000 --> 0:08:31,000
outside the front door,

165
0:08:32.82,000 --> 0:08:34,000
a very strategic location.

166
0:08:37.14,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I asked Crystal the price of the cookie that I had selected,

167
0:08:40.54,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and she said, "Three dollars."

168
0:08:43.1,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:46.979,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I said that seemed a bit high for one cookie.

170
0:08:50.1,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:51.859,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It was small.

172
0:08:55.14,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"I know," she acknowledged with a grin,

173
0:08:57.86,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"but I'm worth it."

174
0:09:00.82,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And therein lie the words of wisdom

175
0:09:02.74,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of a young girl whose brief life forever impacted mine.

176
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Crystal was worth it,

177
0:09:10.9,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and shouldn't every child whose life is shortened by a horrific illness

178
0:09:16.22,000 --> 0:09:17,000
be worth it?

179
0:09:17.86,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Together, all of us today

180
0:09:20.1,000 --> 0:09:23,000
can offer that same specialized care that Crystal received

181
0:09:23.38,000 --> 0:09:28,000
by recognizing that children's respite and hospice care

182
0:09:29.06,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape.

183
0:09:35.375,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's also interesting to note

184
0:09:36.78,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we are able to provide this care

185
0:09:38.62,000 --> 0:09:41,000
at about one third of the cost of a hospital intensive care unit,

186
0:09:43.14,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and our families don't see a bill.

187
0:09:46.7,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We are ever grateful to the supporters

188
0:09:49.5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
who believe in this important work that we're doing.

189
0:09:53.82,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The truth is that my colleagues and I

190
0:09:57.3,000 --> 0:10:,000
and the parents and other family members

191
0:10:00.9,000 --> 0:10:02,000
who get to experience this special wisdom

192
0:10:03.9,000 --> 0:10:04,000
are in a unique position.

193
0:10:06.7,000 --> 0:10:11,000
There are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the United States,

194
0:10:11.94,000 --> 0:10:13,000
although I'm happy to report that based on our model,

195
0:10:14.66,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there are 18 others under various stages of development.

196
0:10:18.74,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

197
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Still, most of the children who die in the United States every year

198
0:10:28.3,000 --> 0:10:3,000
die in hospital rooms,

199
0:10:30.34,000 --> 0:10:32,000
surrounded by beeping machines

200
0:10:32.78,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and anxious, exhausted adults

201
0:10:34.9,000 --> 0:10:35,000
who have no other option

202
0:10:36.9,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but to say goodbye under those harsh, institutional lights

203
0:10:40.74,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and among virtual strangers.

204
0:10:43.62,000 --> 0:10:45,000
For comparison's sake,

205
0:10:45.78,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the United Kingdom,

206
0:10:47.14,000 --> 0:10:51,000
which is a country with about one fifth the population of the United States,

207
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and about half the size of the state of California,

208
0:10:54.94,000 --> 0:10:58,000
has 54 hospice and respite centers.

209
0:11:01.66,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Why is that?

210
0:11:03.54,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I've asked myself that question obviously many times.

211
0:11:08.34,000 --> 0:11:13,000
My best guess is that Americans, with our positive can-do attitude

212
0:11:13.86,000 --> 0:11:17,000
hold the expectation that our medical care system will fix it,

213
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:22,000
even though it may be a childhood illness for which there is no cure.

214
0:11:23.58,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We go to extraordinary measures to keep children alive

215
0:11:27.7,000 --> 0:11:3,000
when in fact the greatest kindness that we might give them

216
0:11:31.1,000 --> 0:11:33,000
would be a peaceful, pain-free

217
0:11:33.86,000 --> 0:11:34,000
end of life.

218
0:11:36.22,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The transition from cure to care

219
0:11:39.06,000 --> 0:11:42,000
remains a challenging one for many hospital physicians

220
0:11:42.3,000 --> 0:11:45,000
whose training has really been about saving lives,

221
0:11:45.82,000 --> 0:11:48,000
not about gently guiding the patient to the end of life.

222
0:11:50.46,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The dad of a sweet baby for whom we cared at the end of her life

223
0:11:54.02,000 --> 0:11:56,000
certainly captured this dichotomy

224
0:11:56.58,000 --> 0:11:57,000
when he reflected

225
0:11:58.18,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that there are a lot of people to help you bring an infant into the world

226
0:12:02.18,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but very few to help you usher a baby out.

227
0:12:06.94,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So what is the magic ingredient at George Mark?

228
0:12:10.98,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The complex medical diagnoses that bring our young patients to us

229
0:12:15.1,000 --> 0:12:17,000
mean that their lives have often been restricted,

230
0:12:18.1,000 --> 0:12:2,000
some to a hospital bed for long periods of time,

231
0:12:20.86,000 --> 0:12:21,000
others to wheelchairs,

232
0:12:22.74,000 --> 0:12:27,000
still others to intensive courses of chemotherapy or rehab.

233
0:12:28.94,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We make a practice of ignoring those limitations.

234
0:12:32.66,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Our default answer is "yes"

235
0:12:34.9,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and our default question is, "Why not?"

236
0:12:38.3,000 --> 0:12:39,000
That's why we took a young boy

237
0:12:40.14,000 --> 0:12:42,000
who wasn't going to live for another baseball season

238
0:12:43.14,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to Game 5 of the World Series.

239
0:12:46.58,000 --> 0:12:49,000
That's why we have a talent show put on by the staff and kids

240
0:12:50.02,000 --> 0:12:51,000
for family and friends.

241
0:12:51.66,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy playing a piano piece with his feet,

242
0:12:56.74,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because his arms are atrophied?

243
0:12:59.62,000 --> 0:13:01,000
That's why we have a prom every year.

244
0:13:03.62,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's pretty magical.

245
0:13:05.62,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We started the prom

246
0:13:07.5,000 --> 0:13:08,000
after hearing a dad lament

247
0:13:09.14,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that he would never pin a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.

248
0:13:15.3,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The weeks before the dance,

249
0:13:17.46,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the house is in a flurry,

250
0:13:18.74,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and I don't know who's more excited, the staff or the kids.

251
0:13:21.54,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Laughter)

252
0:13:22.7,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The night of the event

253
0:13:24.34,000 --> 0:13:28,000
involves rides in vintage cars,

254
0:13:28.82,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a walk on a red carpet

255
0:13:30.82,000 --> 0:13:32,000
into the great room,

256
0:13:33.34,000 --> 0:13:34,000
a terrific DJ

257
0:13:35.98,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and a photographer at the ready

258
0:13:37.78,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to capture pictures of these attendees

259
0:13:40.34,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and their families.

260
0:13:42.46,000 --> 0:13:44,000
At the end of the evening this year,

261
0:13:44.78,000 --> 0:13:47,000
one of our young, delightful teenaged girls,

262
0:13:49.5,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Caitlin, said to her mom,

263
0:13:53.46,000 --> 0:13:55,000
"That was the best night of my whole life."

264
0:13:56.3,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And that's just the point,

265
0:13:58.7,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to capture the best days and nights,

266
0:14:02.46,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to abolish limitations,

267
0:14:05.34,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to have your default answer be "yes"

268
0:14:07.5,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and your default question be, "Why not?"

269
0:14:11.62,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Ultimately life is too short,

270
0:14:14.14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
whether we live to be 85 years or just eight.

271
0:14:17.62,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Trust me.

272
0:14:18.9,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Better yet, trust Sam.

273
0:14:22.58,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's not by pretending that death doesn't exist

274
0:14:26.7,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that we keep the people,

275
0:14:28.54,000 --> 0:14:3,000
especially the little people that we love,

276
0:14:30.98,000 --> 0:14:31,000
safe.

277
0:14:32.9,000 --> 0:14:33,000
In the end,

278
0:14:34.46,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we can't control how long any of us lives.

279
0:14:37.7,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What we can control

280
0:14:39.46,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is how we spend our days,

281
0:14:42.1,000 --> 0:14:43,000
the spaces we create,

282
0:14:44.94,000 --> 0:14:47,000
the meaning and joy that we make.

283
0:14:48.74,000 --> 0:14:51,000
We cannot change the outcome,

284
0:14:51.78,000 --> 0:14:52,000
but we can change the journey.

285
0:14:55.5,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Isn't it time

286
0:14:58.82,000 --> 0:15:,000
to recognize that children deserve

287
0:15:01.1,000 --> 0:15:05,000
nothing less than our most uncompromising bravery

288
0:15:05.5,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and our wildest imagination.

289
0:15:08.86,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Thank you.

290
0:15:10.1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.881,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine with me this scene.

2
0:00:16.889,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's a scene that played out in nearly all of our families.

3
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's a scene in which a young person,

4
0:00:26.053,000 --> 0:00:28,000
somewhere in our family tree,

5
0:00:29.038,000 --> 0:00:31,000
somewhere in our lineage

6
0:00:31.514,000 --> 0:00:33,000
had a heartbreaking decision to make.

7
0:00:35.776,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It was a decision to leave all that they had known.

8
0:00:40.45,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And all of the people that they had loved

9
0:00:44.022,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and to set out for a place far, far away

10
0:00:48.038,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that they had never seen

11
0:00:50.157,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in hopes that life might be better.

12
0:00:53.625,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Migration is usually a young person's endeavor.

13
0:00:59.196,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's the kind of thing that you do when you're on the cusp of life.

14
0:01:03.355,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And so, there is, in all of our families,

15
0:01:07.404,000 --> 0:01:1,000
this young person somewhere in our background.

16
0:01:11.641,000 --> 0:01:14,000
That person is standing at a dock,

17
0:01:14.895,000 --> 0:01:15,000
about to board a ship

18
0:01:16.768,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that will cross the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean.

19
0:01:20.823,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That person is loading up a truck

20
0:01:24.149,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that will cross the Rio Grande.

21
0:01:27.165,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Or that person is standing

22
0:01:30.093,000 --> 0:01:32,000
at a railroad platform

23
0:01:32.419,000 --> 0:01:37,000
about to board a train that will cross rivers and mountains

24
0:01:38.427,000 --> 0:01:4,000
out of the Jim Crow South

25
0:01:40.641,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to what they hope will be freedom in the North.

26
0:01:45.665,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And there, with this young person

27
0:01:50.013,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as they are about to board that ship,

28
0:01:54.022,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that boat,

29
0:01:55.466,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that truck, that train,

30
0:01:58.752,000 --> 0:02:,000
are the people who raised them.

31
0:02:01.946,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Their mother, their father,

32
0:02:04.874,000 --> 0:02:07,000
their aunt, their uncle, their grandparents,

33
0:02:08.747,000 --> 0:02:11,000
whoever it might have been who had gotten them to this point.

34
0:02:13.469,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Those older people

35
0:02:14.652,000 --> 0:02:17,000
were not going to be able to make the crossing with them.

36
0:02:19.247,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And as they looked into the eyes of the people who had raised them,

37
0:02:24.561,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there was no guarantee

38
0:02:26.895,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that they would ever see them alive again.

39
0:02:31.91,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Remember, there was no Skype,

40
0:02:34.903,000 --> 0:02:37,000
no e-mail, no cell phones

41
0:02:38.442,000 --> 0:02:4,000
not even reliable long-distance telephone service.

42
0:02:41.909,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And even if there had been,

43
0:02:43.909,000 --> 0:02:48,000
many of the people that they were leaving did not even have telephones.

44
0:02:49.22,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This was going to be a complete break

45
0:02:52.347,000 --> 0:02:54,000
from all that they knew

46
0:02:54.442,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and all of the people that they loved.

47
0:02:57.18,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the very next time

48
0:02:59.228,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that they might hear anything about the people who had raised them

49
0:03:04.633,000 --> 0:03:09,000
might be a telegram saying, "Your father has passed away."

50
0:03:11.427,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Or, "Your mother is very, very ill.

51
0:03:15.053,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You must return home quickly if you are to see her alive again."

52
0:03:21.828,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That is the magnitude of the sacrifice

53
0:03:25.575,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that had to have happened in nearly all of our families

54
0:03:30.043,000 --> 0:03:31,000
just for us to be here.

55
0:03:32.565,000 --> 0:03:37,000
A single decision that changed the course of families

56
0:03:37.843,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and lineages and countries and history

57
0:03:41.946,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to the current day.

58
0:03:45.308,000 --> 0:03:47,000
One of these migration streams

59
0:03:47.919,000 --> 0:03:49,000
stands out in ways that we may not realize.

60
0:03:51.863,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was called the Great Migration.

61
0:03:54.839,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It was the outpouring of six million African Americans

62
0:04:00.418,000 --> 0:04:02,000
from the Jim Crow South

63
0:04:02.529,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to the cities of the North and West,

64
0:04:05.307,000 --> 0:04:08,000
from the time of World War I until the 1970s.

65
0:04:10.109,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It stands out because this was the first time in American history

66
0:04:16.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that American citizens had to flee the land of their birth

67
0:04:23.056,000 --> 0:04:27,000
just to be recognized as the citizens that they had always been.

68
0:04:28.022,000 --> 0:04:3,000
No other group of Americans

69
0:04:30.3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
has had to act like immigrants

70
0:04:34.696,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in order to be recognized as citizens.

71
0:04:37.864,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So this great migration was not a move.

72
0:04:43.043,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was actually a seeking of political asylum

73
0:04:47.212,000 --> 0:04:49,000
within the borders of one's own country.

74
0:04:51.704,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They were defecting a caste system known as Jim Crow.

75
0:04:57.545,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It was an artificial hierarchy

76
0:04:59.466,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in which everything that you could and could not do

77
0:05:03.49,000 --> 0:05:05,000
was based upon what you looked like.

78
0:05:07.49,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This caste system was so arcane that it was actually against the law

79
0:05:12.117,000 --> 0:05:15,000
for a black person and a white person

80
0:05:15.307,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to merely play checkers together in Birmingham.

81
0:05:19.109,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You could go to jail

82
0:05:20.99,000 --> 0:05:23,000
if you were caught playing checkers with a person of a different race.

83
0:05:25.244,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Someone must have seen a black person and a white person

84
0:05:30.03,000 --> 0:05:33,000
playing checkers with someone in some town square.

85
0:05:33.657,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And maybe the wrong person was winning

86
0:05:37.125,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or they were having too good of a time,

87
0:05:39.641,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but whatever it was that this person saw,

88
0:05:42.388,000 --> 0:05:44,000
with this black person and this white person playing checkers,

89
0:05:45.355,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they felt the entire foundation of Southern civilization was in peril.

90
0:05:50.061,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And decided that it was worth taking the time

91
0:05:52.792,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to write this down as a law.

92
0:05:56.149,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This caste system was so arcane

93
0:05:58.848,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that in courtrooms throughout the South there was actually a black Bible

94
0:06:04.744,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and an altogether separate white Bible

95
0:06:07.999,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to swear to tell the truth on in court.

96
0:06:12.328,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The very word of God was segregated

97
0:06:15.157,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in the caste system of the Jim Crow South.

98
0:06:20.339,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The same sacred object

99
0:06:23.53,000 --> 0:06:26,000
could not be touched by hands of different races.

100
0:06:28.831,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This artificial hierarchy,

101
0:06:31.981,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because it goes against human desires to be free,

102
0:06:37.597,000 --> 0:06:41,000
required a tremendous amount of violence to maintain.

103
0:06:42.557,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Such that every four days, somewhere in the American South,

104
0:06:47.03,000 --> 0:06:5,000
every four days an African American was lynched

105
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for some perceived breach of protocol in this caste system

106
0:06:54.831,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in the decades leading up to the start of the Great Migration.

107
0:07:00.776,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This caste system had been put in place for many, many reasons.

108
0:07:05.252,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But one of them was to maintain the economic order of the South,

109
0:07:10.395,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which required not just a supply of cheap labor

110
0:07:14.45,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but an oversupply of cheap labor to work at the will of the land.

111
0:07:20.77,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This Great Migration began when the North had a labor problem.

112
0:07:26.691,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The North had a labor problem

113
0:07:28.208,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because it had been relying on cheap labor from Europe --

114
0:07:31.538,000 --> 0:07:32,000
immigrants from Europe --

115
0:07:32.863,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to work the factories and the foundries and the steel mills.

116
0:07:36.346,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But during World War I,

117
0:07:38.863,000 --> 0:07:41,000
migration from Europe came to a virtual halt.

118
0:07:42.18,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And so the North had a labor problem.

119
0:07:44.721,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And so the North decided to go and find the cheapest labor in the land

120
0:07:50.53,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which meant African Americans in the South,

121
0:07:53.434,000 --> 0:07:56,000
many of whom were not even being paid for their hard work.

122
0:07:57.157,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Many of them were working

123
0:07:58.53,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for the right to live on the land that they were farming.

124
0:08:01.926,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They were sharecroppers and not even being paid.

125
0:08:04.577,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So they were ripe for recruitment.

126
0:08:07.482,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But it turned out

127
0:08:09.403,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that the South did not take kindly to this poaching of its cheap labor.

128
0:08:14.871,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The South actually did everything it could to keep the people from leaving.

129
0:08:19.06,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They would arrest people from the railroad platforms.

130
0:08:22.871,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Remember, putatively free American citizens.

131
0:08:26.895,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They would arrest them from their train seats.

132
0:08:29.839,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And when there were too many people to arrest,

133
0:08:32.411,000 --> 0:08:34,000
they would wave the train on through

134
0:08:34.72,000 --> 0:08:36,000
so that people who had been hoping

135
0:08:37.038,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and saving

136
0:08:38.3,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and praying for the chance to get to freedom

137
0:08:41.561,000 --> 0:08:44,000
had to figure out: How now will we get out?

138
0:08:46.211,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And as they made their way out of the South,

139
0:08:49.592,000 --> 0:08:51,000
away from Jim Crow,

140
0:08:52.092,000 --> 0:08:55,000
they followed three beautifully predictable streams

141
0:08:55.525,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as is the case in any migration throughout human history.

142
0:09:00.541,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In this particular case, there were three streams.

143
0:09:03.709,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One was the migration along the East Coast

144
0:09:08.602,000 --> 0:09:12,000
from Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia

145
0:09:12.846,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to Washington DC, to Philadelphia,

146
0:09:15.728,000 --> 0:09:18,000
New Jersey, New York and on up the East coast.

147
0:09:19.22,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There was the Midwest stream,

148
0:09:20.855,000 --> 0:09:23,000
which carried people from Mississippi, Alabama,

149
0:09:24.768,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Tennessee and Arkansas

150
0:09:27.006,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to Chicago, to Detroit, to Cleveland and the entire Midwest.

151
0:09:31.961,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And then there was the West Coast stream,

152
0:09:34.176,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which carried people from Louisiana and Texas

153
0:09:38.173,000 --> 0:09:39,000
out to California.

154
0:09:39.966,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And when they really wanted to get away,

155
0:09:42.434,000 --> 0:09:43,000
they went to Seattle.

156
0:09:44.085,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And when they really, really wanted to get away,

157
0:09:47.951,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they went to Alaska,

158
0:09:49.7,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the farthest possible point within the borders of the United States

159
0:09:53.981,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from Jim Crow South.

160
0:09:57.941,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Before the Great Migration began,

161
0:10:00.394,000 --> 0:10:04,000
90 percent of all African Americans were living in the South.

162
0:10:04.831,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Nearly held captive in the South.

163
0:10:08.276,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But by the time this Great Migration was over,

164
0:10:11.49,000 --> 0:10:14,000
nearly half were living all over the rest of the country.

165
0:10:14.966,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So this ended up being nearly a complete redistribution

166
0:10:18.569,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of part of an entire people.

167
0:10:23.037,000 --> 0:10:28,000
This Great Migration was the first time in American history

168
0:10:28.228,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that the lowest caste people

169
0:10:31.326,000 --> 0:10:34,000
signaled that they had options and were willing to take them.

170
0:10:36.227,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That had not happened in the three centuries

171
0:10:40.701,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in which African Americans had been on that soil at that time.

172
0:10:46.707,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It had not happened in 12 generations of enslavement

173
0:10:51.148,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that preceded nearly a century of Jim Crow.

174
0:10:55.489,000 --> 0:10:57,000
How many "greats"

175
0:10:57.973,000 --> 0:11:,000
do you have to add to the word "grandparent"

176
0:11:01.227,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to begin to imagine how long enslavement lasted in the United States?

177
0:11:08.715,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Secondly, this Great Migration was the first time in American history

178
0:11:15.001,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that the lowest caste people

179
0:11:17.886,000 --> 0:11:21,000
actually had a chance to choose for themselves

180
0:11:22.895,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what they would do with their God-given talents

181
0:11:26.251,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and where they would pursue them.

182
0:11:29.84,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Think about those cotton fields

183
0:11:32.649,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and those rice plantations

184
0:11:34.8,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and those tobacco fields

185
0:11:36.84,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and those sugar plantations.

186
0:11:39.41,000 --> 0:11:41,000
On those sugar plantations,

187
0:11:41.688,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and on those tobacco fields,

188
0:11:44.069,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and on those rice plantations,

189
0:11:46.426,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and on those cotton fields

190
0:11:48.592,000 --> 0:11:5,000
were opera singers,

191
0:11:50.703,000 --> 0:11:52,000
jazz musicians,

192
0:11:52.759,000 --> 0:11:53,000
playwrights,

193
0:11:54.558,000 --> 0:11:55,000
novelists,

194
0:11:56.24,000 --> 0:11:57,000
surgeons,

195
0:11:57.931,000 --> 0:11:58,000
attorneys,

196
0:11:59.653,000 --> 0:12:,000
accountants,

197
0:12:01.264,000 --> 0:12:02,000
professors,

198
0:12:03.002,000 --> 0:12:04,000
journalists.

199
0:12:04.653,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And how do we know that?

200
0:12:06.533,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We know that because that is what they and their children

201
0:12:11.402,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and now their grandchildren and even great-grandchildren

202
0:12:15.309,000 --> 0:12:17,000
have often chosen to become

203
0:12:17.529,000 --> 0:12:21,000
once they had the chance to choose for themselves

204
0:12:21.759,000 --> 0:12:23,000
what they would do with their God-given talents.

205
0:12:25.402,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Without the Great Migration,

206
0:12:27.865,000 --> 0:12:31,000
there might not have been a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be.

207
0:12:33.451,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Her parents were from Alabama and from Georgia.

208
0:12:36.674,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They migrated to Ohio,

209
0:12:38.699,000 --> 0:12:4,000
where their daughter would get to do something

210
0:12:40.894,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that we all take for granted at this point,

211
0:12:43.759,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but which was against the law and against protocol for African Americans

212
0:12:48.322,000 --> 0:12:5,000
at the time that she would have been growing up in the South,

213
0:12:51.22,000 --> 0:12:52,000
had they stayed.

214
0:12:52.426,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And that is just to walk into a library

215
0:12:55.061,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and take out a library book.

216
0:12:57.18,000 --> 0:13:,000
Merely by making the single decision to leave,

217
0:13:01.18,000 --> 0:13:05,000
her parents assured that their daughter would get access to books.

218
0:13:05.727,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And if you're going to become a Nobel laureate,

219
0:13:08.489,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it helps to get a book now and then.

220
0:13:10.457,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You know, it helps.

221
0:13:13.505,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Music as we know it was reshaped by the Great Migration.

222
0:13:19.434,000 --> 0:13:21,000
As they came North, they brought with them,

223
0:13:21.949,000 --> 0:13:23,000
on their hearts and in their memories,

224
0:13:24.68,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the music that had sustained the ancestors --

225
0:13:27.798,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the blues music, the spirituals and the gospel music

226
0:13:31.719,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that had sustained them through the generations.

227
0:13:34.751,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And they converted this music into whole new genres of music.

228
0:13:39.045,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And got the chance to record this music,

229
0:13:42.077,000 --> 0:13:44,000
this new music that they were creating,

230
0:13:44.18,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and to spread it throughout the world.

231
0:13:47.807,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Without the Great Migration, "Motown" would not have existed.

232
0:13:51.843,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The founder, Berry Gordy, his parents were from Georgia.

233
0:13:54.843,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They migrated to Detroit.

234
0:13:56.47,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And when he got to be a grown man, he decided he wanted to go into music.

235
0:14:00.188,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But he didn't have the wherewithal to go all over the country

236
0:14:03.584,000 --> 0:14:04,000
looking for the best talent,

237
0:14:05.188,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and it turned out he didn't have to.

238
0:14:07.477,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It turned out that there he was,

239
0:14:09.41,000 --> 0:14:12,000
surrounded by children of the Great Migration

240
0:14:12.457,000 --> 0:14:15,000
whose parents had brought this music up with them during the journey.

241
0:14:16.822,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And among those children were these three girls,

242
0:14:20.299,000 --> 0:14:21,000
there was Mary Wilson,

243
0:14:23.292,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Florence Ballard

244
0:14:25.405,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and there was a third one:

245
0:14:27.478,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Diana Ross.

246
0:14:29.111,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We might not know Diana Ross' name had there been no Great Migration.

247
0:14:33.925,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Because like a lot of Americans and a lot of human beings in general,

248
0:14:37.614,000 --> 0:14:39,000
she might not have existed because her parents might not have met.

249
0:14:40.769,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Her mother was from Alabama,

250
0:14:42.999,000 --> 0:14:43,000
father from West Virginia,

251
0:14:44.769,000 --> 0:14:47,000
they migrated to Detroit, different years,

252
0:14:48.196,000 --> 0:14:51,000
met, married, had her and her siblings,

253
0:14:51.387,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and thus a legend was born.

254
0:14:54.705,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Jazz was a creation of the Great Migration.

255
0:14:58.507,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And one of the greatest gifts of the Great Migration.

256
0:15:02.197,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Starting with Louis Armstrong, who was born in Louisiana

257
0:15:06.243,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and migrated on the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago,

258
0:15:10.283,000 --> 0:15:13,000
where he got the chance to build on the talent

259
0:15:13.71,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that was within him all along.

260
0:15:16.267,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Miles Davis.

261
0:15:17.545,000 --> 0:15:19,000
His parents were from Arkansas.

262
0:15:19.624,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They migrated to southern Illinois,

263
0:15:22.465,000 --> 0:15:24,000
where he would get the chance to build on the talents

264
0:15:25.36,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that were within him all along

265
0:15:27.695,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but which could have gone fallow in the cotton country of Arkansas.

266
0:15:34.124,000 --> 0:15:35,000
John Coltrane.

267
0:15:36.029,000 --> 0:15:38,000
He migrated at the age of 16

268
0:15:38.894,000 --> 0:15:41,000
from North Carolina to Philadelphia,

269
0:15:42.307,000 --> 0:15:46,000
where, upon arrival in Philadelphia, he got his first alto sax.

270
0:15:47.362,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And there are lovers of jazz who cannot imagine a world

271
0:15:50.854,000 --> 0:15:53,000
without John Coltrane having gotten a hold of a saxophone.

272
0:15:56.027,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thelonious Monk.

273
0:15:58.345,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Michael Jackson.

274
0:16:00.138,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Jesse Owens.

275
0:16:01.821,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Prince.

276
0:16:03.114,000 --> 0:16:04,000
August Wilson.

277
0:16:04.567,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Richard Wright.

278
0:16:05.965,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Ralph Ellison.

279
0:16:07.711,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Michelle Obama.

280
0:16:09.941,000 --> 0:16:14,000
These are all a few of the millions of people

281
0:16:15.013,000 --> 0:16:18,000
who were products of the single decision to migrate.

282
0:16:20.769,000 --> 0:16:21,000
The people of the Great Migration

283
0:16:22.785,000 --> 0:16:24,000
met with tremendous resistance in the North.

284
0:16:25.809,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And they were not able to defeat all social injustice.

285
0:16:31.275,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But one person

286
0:16:33.124,000 --> 0:16:35,000
added to another person,

287
0:16:35.243,000 --> 0:16:36,000
added to another person,

288
0:16:36.91,000 --> 0:16:39,000
multiplied by millions,

289
0:16:39.989,000 --> 0:16:43,000
were able to become the advance guard of the civil rights movement.

290
0:16:45.471,000 --> 0:16:47,000
One person added to another person,

291
0:16:48.376,000 --> 0:16:49,000
added to another person,

292
0:16:50.011,000 --> 0:16:51,000
multiplied by millions,

293
0:16:51.193,000 --> 0:16:53,000
acting on a single decision,

294
0:16:53.566,000 --> 0:16:57,000
were able to change the region that they had been forced to flee.

295
0:17:00.136,000 --> 0:17:02,000
They had more power in leaving

296
0:17:03.376,000 --> 0:17:04,000
than by staying.

297
0:17:06.703,000 --> 0:17:07,000
By their actions,

298
0:17:08.131,000 --> 0:17:11,000
these people who had absolutely nothing

299
0:17:11.989,000 --> 0:17:14,000
were able to do what a president of the United States,

300
0:17:15.967,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Abraham Lincoln, was not able to do.

301
0:17:19.586,000 --> 0:17:22,000
These people, by their actions,

302
0:17:22.681,000 --> 0:17:23,000
were able to do

303
0:17:23.874,000 --> 0:17:26,000
what the Emancipation Proclamation could not do.

304
0:17:28.411,000 --> 0:17:31,000
These people, by their actions,

305
0:17:31.808,000 --> 0:17:34,000
were able to do what the powers that be,

306
0:17:35.231,000 --> 0:17:37,000
North and South,

307
0:17:37.58,000 --> 0:17:39,000
could not or would not do.

308
0:17:41.618,000 --> 0:17:42,000
They freed themselves.

309
0:17:43.991,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Thank you.

310
0:17:45.189,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Applause)

311
0:17:51.247,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you.

312
0:17:52.422,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

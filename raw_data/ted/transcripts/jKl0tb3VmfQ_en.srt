1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Okay, so

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
90 percent of my photographic process

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is, in fact, not photographic.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It involves a campaign of letter writing,

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
research and phone calls

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to access my subjects,

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to a hibernating black bear in its cave

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in West Virginia.

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And oddly, the most notable

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
letter of rejection I ever received

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
came from Walt Disney World,

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a seemingly innocuous site.

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"Especially during these violent times,

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I personally believe

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks

18
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is particularly important to protect

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and helps to provide them with an important fantasy

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
they can escape to."

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Photography threatens fantasy.

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They didn't want to let my camera in

23
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and provides what appears to be

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
evidence of a truth.

26
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But there are multiple truths attached to every image,

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
depending on the creator's intention, the viewer

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and the context in which it is presented.

29
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Over a five year period following September 11th,

30
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when the American media and government were seeking

31
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
hidden and unknown sites

32
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
beyond its borders,

33
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
most notably weapons of mass destruction,

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I chose to look inward at that which was integral

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to America's foundation,

36
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
mythology and daily functioning.

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
self-imposed and real,

39
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
and confront the divide between privileged

40
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and public access to knowledge.

41
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It was a critical moment in American history

42
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and global history

43
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.

44
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,

45
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but what I came away with is a photograph.

46
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it's just another place from which to observe,

47
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and the understanding that

48
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.

49
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the outsider can never really reach the core.

50
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.

51
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's titled, "An American Index

52
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"

53
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.

54
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In this context I'll just show you a few.

55
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility

56
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at Hanford site in Washington State,

57
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where there are over 1,900

58
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste

59
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
submerged in water.

60
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.

61
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I found one section amongst all of these

62
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that actually resembled the outline

63
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of the United States of America,

64
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which you can see here.

65
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And a big part of the work that is

66
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
sort of absent in this context is text.

67
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I create these two poles.

68
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.

69
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And what I'm most interested in

70
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is the invisible space between a text

71
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and its accompanying image,

72
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and how the image is transformed by the text

73
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the text by the image.

74
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So, at best, the image is meant to float away

75
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.

76
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor

77
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that kind of nails it to the ground.

78
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But in this context I'm just going to read

79
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
an abridged version of those texts.

80
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This is a cryopreservation unit,

81
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother

82
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,

83
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life

84
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in good health, with advancements in science and technology,

85
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.

86
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman

87
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
undergoing hymenoplasty.

88
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,

89
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations

90
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
regarding virginity and marriage.

91
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,

92
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,

93
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to simulate the loss of virginity.

94
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is a jury simulation deliberation room,

95
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and you can see beyond that two-way mirror

96
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.

97
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And they observe deliberations

98
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
after mock trial proceedings

99
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy

100
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to have the outcome that they're hoping for.

101
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This process costs 60,000 dollars.

102
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,

103
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

104
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth

105
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.

106
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.

107
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And part of my photographic work

108
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is I'm not just documenting what's there.

109
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I do take certain liberties and intervene.

110
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And in this I really wanted it to resemble

111
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
an early still-life painting,

112
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so I spent some time with the smells and items.

113
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA

114
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.

115
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And the CIA has had a long history

116
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.

117
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts

118
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
was designed to counter Soviet communism

119
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and promote what it considered to be pro-American

120
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
thoughts and aesthetics.

121
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,

122
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.

123
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,

124
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and on a six acre plot

125
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time

126
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that are being studied by forensic anthropologists

127
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and researchers who are interested in monitoring

128
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
a rate of corpse decomposition.

129
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy

130
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
has been used to reenact a crime scene.

131
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is the only federally funded site

132
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
where it is legal to cultivate cannabis

133
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
for scientific research in the United States.

134
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.

135
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And part of the work that I hope for

136
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy

137
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --

138
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science

139
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to religion to security --

140
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and you can't completely understand

141
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
how information is being distributed.

142
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables

143
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,

144
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
connecting North America to Europe.

145
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,

146
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and in a lot of the government and technology sites

147
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
there was just this very apparent vulnerability.

148
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could

149
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.

150
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken

151
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era

152
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and hadn't necessarily progressed.

153
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.

154
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress

156
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
produces a free national library service

157
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for the blind and visually impaired,

158
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the publications they choose to publish

159
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are based on reader popularity.

160
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And Playboy is always in the top few.

161
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.

163
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is an avian quarantine facility

165
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
where all imported birds coming into America

166
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,

167
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
where they are tested for diseases

168
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
including Exotic Newcastle Disease

169
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and Avian Influenza.

170
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This film shows

171
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.

172
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And the Air Armament Center

173
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida

174
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is responsible for the deployment and testing

175
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of all air-delivered weaponry

176
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
coming from the United States.

177
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.

178
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.

179
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
All living white tigers in North America

180
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
are the result of selective inbreeding --

181
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that would be mother to son,

182
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
father to daughter, sister to brother --

183
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to allow for the genetic conditions

184
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that create a salable white tiger.

185
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.

186
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the majority of these white tigers

187
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
are not born in a salable state

188
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and are killed at birth.

189
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's a very violent process that is little known.

190
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.

191
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.

192
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He has since passed away,

193
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but was mentally retarded

194
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.

195
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This, on a lighter note, is at

196
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
George Lucas' personal archive.

197
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This is the Death Star.

198
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And it's shown here in its true orientation.

199
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"

200
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
its mirror image is presented.

201
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They flip the negative.

202
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing,

203
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and the painted acrylic facade.

204
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In the context of the film,

205
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,

206
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
capable of annihilating planets and civilizations,

207
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.

208
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.

210
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.

211
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Essentially they've simulated a city

212
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for urban combat,

213
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.

214
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's called the World Church of God.

215
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.

216
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And after I took this photograph,

217
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they constructed a wall around the World Church of God

218
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.

219
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I worked with Mehta Vihar

220
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who creates virtual simulations for the army

221
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for tactical practice.

222
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And we put that wall around the World Church of God,

223
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions

224
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that are offered in the video games for the army.

225
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I put them into my photograph.

226
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is live HIV virus

227
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government

228
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to develop sterilizing immunity.

229
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored

230
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Arabic language television network

231
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.

232
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.

233
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.

234
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,

235
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq

236
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and is broadcast to Iraq.

237
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.

238
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's titled "The Innocents."

239
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And for the men in these photographs,

240
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
photography had been used to create a fantasy.

241
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth,

242
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.

243
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I traveled across the United States

244
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted

245
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.

246
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,

247
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and its influence on memory,

248
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.

249
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
For the men in these photographs,

250
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the primary cause of their wrongful conviction

251
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
was mistaken identification.

252
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
A victim or eyewitness identifies

253
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
a suspected perpetrator

254
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
through law enforcement's use of images.

255
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But through exposure to composite sketches,

256
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups,

257
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
eyewitness testimony can change.

258
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I'll give you an example from a case.

259
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs

260
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
from which to identify her attacker.

261
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs,

262
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but couldn't quite make a positive identification.

263
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Days later, she is presented with another photo array

264
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of all new photographs,

265
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
except that one photograph that she had some draw to

266
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.

267
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And a positive identification is made

268
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because the photograph replaced the memory,

269
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
if there ever was an actual memory.

270
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Photography offered the criminal justice system

271
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,

272
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations

273
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
of relying on photographic identifications.

274
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,

275
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.

276
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
He was convicted by an all-white jury

277
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.

278
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.

279
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now DNA exonerated Frederick

280
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and it also implicated another man

281
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
who was serving time in prison.

282
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But the victim refused to press charges

283
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
because she claimed that law enforcement

284
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.

285
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder

286
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
of a young girl walking to school.

287
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
He served 18 years of a death sentence.

288
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I photographed him at the scene of the crime

289
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
at the Snake River in Idaho.

290
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted

291
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
at sites that came to particular significance

292
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
in the history of their wrongful conviction.

293
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,

294
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the alibi location.

295
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place

296
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.

297
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight

298
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,

299
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in both his life and in photography.

300
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.

301
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.

302
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,

303
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,

304
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in this very room to hide from the police.

305
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
He ended up serving 18 and a half years

306
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.

307
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The victim failed to identify Larry

308
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in two live lineups

309
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and then made a positive identification, days later,

310
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
from a photo array.

311
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence

312
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing

313
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.

314
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
He is photographed at his alibi location.

315
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder

316
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of a barmaid at a club,

317
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and served 11 years of a death sentence.

318
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I photographed Ron at a baseball field

319
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's

320
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to play professional baseball just before his conviction.

321
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And the state's key witness in Ron's case

322
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.

323
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence

324
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.

325
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.

326
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.

327
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.

328
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location

329
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,

330
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
was convicted of 3.5 years

331
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
of a 3220 year sentence,

332
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
for several charges of rape and robbery.

333
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.

334
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.

335
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,

336
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.

337
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Troy's picture was in a photo array

338
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that the victim tentatively had some draw toward,

339
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but said he looked too old.

340
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb

341
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
from four years earlier,

342
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
which they entered into a photo array days later,

343
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and he was positively identified.

344
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.

345
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant,

346
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and our eyes are easily deceived.

347
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
That's it. Thank you.

348
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

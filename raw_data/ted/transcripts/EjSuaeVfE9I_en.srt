2
0:00:15.273,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Over the past six months, I've spent my time

3
0:00:19.116,000 --> 0:00:22,000
traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,

4
0:00:22.507,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but without leaving my desk.

5
0:00:25.429,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.

6
0:00:28.275,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,

7
0:00:31.228,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy

8
0:00:35.629,000 --> 0:00:38,000
avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.

9
0:00:39.309,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,

10
0:00:42.118,000 --> 0:00:45,000
if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,

11
0:00:45.18,000 --> 0:00:48,000
so it's important that we focus on outcomes.

12
0:00:48.764,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,

13
0:00:50.697,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.

14
0:00:53.165,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?"

15
0:00:55.973,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.

16
0:00:59.066,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So let's just walk our way through this.

17
0:01:01.13,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Please could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.

18
0:01:04.579,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?

19
0:01:06.761,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The answer is?

20
0:01:07.907,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Audience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.

21
0:01:10.631,000 --> 0:01:11,000
No, they're not the same. (Laughter)

22
0:01:12.378,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.

23
0:01:16.007,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,

24
0:01:19.316,000 --> 0:01:21,000
about that big, they played the same trick on us?

25
0:01:21.771,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?

26
0:01:24.108,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.

27
0:01:27.255,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:

28
0:01:31.091,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,

29
0:01:34.971,000 --> 0:01:36,000
you say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.

30
0:01:37.54,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.

31
0:01:41.707,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Somebody or something has changed the rules

32
0:01:44.005,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about how our world works.

33
0:01:46.062,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,

34
0:01:48.968,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?

35
0:01:52.804,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,

36
0:01:55.419,000 --> 0:01:57,000
they switched all the rules round, so that the way to

37
0:01:58.091,000 --> 0:02:01,000
successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,

38
0:02:01.683,000 --> 0:02:03,000
has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new

39
0:02:04.364,000 --> 0:02:08,000
— you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)

40
0:02:08.644,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.

41
0:02:10.454,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)

42
0:02:12.289,000 --> 0:02:16,000
My simple idea is that what's happened is,

43
0:02:16.631,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,

44
0:02:20.625,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so instead we spend our time responding rationally

45
0:02:23.67,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to a world which we understand and recognize,

46
0:02:26.843,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but which no longer exists.

47
0:02:29.262,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)

48
0:02:31.471,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.

49
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"

50
0:02:38.967,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you'll discover something like 90,000 books.

51
0:02:41.334,000 --> 0:02:43,000
If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"

52
0:02:44.138,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)

53
0:02:48.397,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover

54
0:02:51.582,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money

55
0:02:54.567,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or delivering benefits two years after its inception.

56
0:02:57.69,000 --> 0:03:,000
It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives

57
0:03:00.703,000 --> 0:03:02,000
spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets

58
0:03:03.263,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.

59
0:03:07.323,000 --> 0:03:1,000
How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,

60
0:03:11.046,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the visions of how we're going to change the world,

61
0:03:12.823,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the key thing is implementation. We have the vision.

62
0:03:15.448,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We've got to make it happen.

63
0:03:16.804,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.

64
0:03:19.796,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.

65
0:03:22.253,000 --> 0:03:26,000
However, if I use as an example a family of five

66
0:03:27.15,000 --> 0:03:29,000
going on holiday, if you can imagine this,

67
0:03:29.884,000 --> 0:03:33,000
all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,

68
0:03:34.284,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.

69
0:03:38.193,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What actually happens is, if I compare this to the average

70
0:03:41.324,000 --> 0:03:46,000
real project, average real successful project,

71
0:03:47.111,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,

72
0:03:51.337,000 --> 0:03:54,000
at a cost of 4,000 pounds,

73
0:03:54.354,000 --> 0:03:56,000
whilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)

74
0:03:57.059,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.

75
0:04:01.394,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.

76
0:04:05.679,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.

77
0:04:08.253,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty,

78
0:04:11.596,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity

79
0:04:15.102,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity

80
0:04:18.865,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the number of bright minds," or something like that.

81
0:04:22.263,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England

82
0:04:26.071,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when she asked the question,

83
0:04:28.076,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)

84
0:04:31.015,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)

85
0:04:34.518,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,

86
0:04:36.746,000 --> 0:04:39,000
these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people

87
0:04:40.208,000 --> 0:04:43,000
on the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)

88
0:04:43.724,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,

89
0:04:48.271,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he explains that design must get big, and he's right.

90
0:04:52.173,000 --> 0:04:54,000
He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking

91
0:04:54.792,000 --> 0:04:56,000
must tackle big systems for the challenges we have.

92
0:04:57.094,000 --> 0:04:59,000
He's absolutely right.

93
0:04:59.231,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"

94
0:05:02.904,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,

95
0:05:06.766,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is cross-functional working is so amazing,

96
0:05:08.899,000 --> 0:05:13,000
why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?

97
0:05:14.125,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that

98
0:05:18.406,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we've not noticed that change I described earlier.

99
0:05:22.492,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What we do know is that the world has accelerated.

100
0:05:25.27,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.

101
0:05:27.592,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Technology accelerates things exponentially.

102
0:05:30.064,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So if this is now, and that's the past,

103
0:05:32.226,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we start thinking about change, you know,

104
0:05:33.596,000 --> 0:05:35,000
all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,

105
0:05:36.167,000 --> 0:05:38,000
everybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)

106
0:05:38.838,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.

107
0:05:43.281,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.

108
0:05:47.377,000 --> 0:05:49,000
At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.

109
0:05:50.048,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We've doubled the population in 40 years,

110
0:05:52.697,000 --> 0:05:55,000
put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.

111
0:05:56.311,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.

112
0:05:59.18,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.

113
0:06:04.032,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And then we've done a third thing.

114
0:06:05.666,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you know, for those of you who have as an office

115
0:06:07.661,000 --> 0:06:12,000
a little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,

116
0:06:13.13,000 --> 0:06:19,000
no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.

117
0:06:19.521,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What's happened is, we've changed the scale.

118
0:06:22.435,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Size and scale are no longer the same.

119
0:06:25.382,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And then add to that, every time you tweet,

120
0:06:28.604,000 --> 0:06:3,000
over a third of your followers follow from a country

121
0:06:31.394,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is not your own.

122
0:06:34.302,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Global is the new scale. We know that.

123
0:06:37.311,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?

124
0:06:41.323,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?

125
0:06:44.084,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.

126
0:06:47.217,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember

127
0:06:50.434,000 --> 0:06:53,000
going to a demonstration where they basically,

128
0:06:54.425,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.

129
0:06:56.836,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? —

130
0:07:02.018,000 --> 0:07:05,000
he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,

131
0:07:05.434,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap

132
0:07:08.609,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.

133
0:07:11.324,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)

134
0:07:14.522,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.

135
0:07:18.324,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.

136
0:07:20.945,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?

137
0:07:24.066,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.

138
0:07:28.184,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,

139
0:07:31.896,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and he connects this to a container, and he fills

140
0:07:34.072,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the container up with green ink. You with me?

141
0:07:37.393,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out

142
0:07:41.183,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.

143
0:07:45.529,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.

144
0:07:49.821,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.

145
0:07:53.007,000 --> 0:07:55,000
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.

146
0:07:55.874,000 --> 0:08:,000
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,

147
0:08:01.03,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the whole of that green line disappears, and instead

148
0:08:04.005,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.

149
0:08:07.365,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink

150
0:08:10.529,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.

151
0:08:14.213,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What's happened in this world of pipe

152
0:08:18.226,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.

153
0:08:22.153,000 --> 0:08:25,000
All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,

154
0:08:25.834,000 --> 0:08:29,000
all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,

155
0:08:29.953,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and it's not the same as laminar.

156
0:08:32.795,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.

157
0:08:37.753,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I think this is our challenge, because somebody

158
0:08:41.05,000 --> 0:08:45,000
has actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —

159
0:08:45.154,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.

160
0:08:49.135,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now how do we cope and deal with that?

161
0:08:50.834,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.

162
0:08:54.267,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when

163
0:08:59.365,000 --> 0:09:01,000
there were actually these things called correct answers,

164
0:09:02.169,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,

165
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and you believe it will last forever.

166
0:09:07.143,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,

167
0:09:10.57,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and that's how we used to do it. We could see things,

168
0:09:12.745,000 --> 0:09:14,000
understand them, take the time to put them into practice.

169
0:09:15.258,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace

170
0:09:19.107,000 --> 0:09:22,000
of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work

171
0:09:22.352,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work

172
0:09:24.898,000 --> 0:09:26,000
on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,

173
0:09:27.844,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.

174
0:09:30.449,000 --> 0:09:35,000
If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.

175
0:09:35.817,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,

176
0:09:38.552,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way

177
0:09:40.939,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?

178
0:09:44.562,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.

179
0:09:50.114,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You with me? This point over here, the point at which

180
0:09:54.311,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the lines cross over, the pace of change

181
0:09:58.214,000 --> 0:10:01,000
overtakes the pace of learning,

182
0:10:01.358,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and for me, that is what I was describing

183
0:10:04.243,000 --> 0:10:07,000
when I was telling you about midnight.

184
0:10:07.5,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,

185
0:10:10.661,000 --> 0:10:13,000
many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems

186
0:10:14.3,000 --> 0:10:16,000
without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,

187
0:10:17.036,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?

188
0:10:19.972,000 --> 0:10:21,000
If you haven't understood the world you're living in,

189
0:10:22.492,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.

190
0:10:26.108,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,

191
0:10:29.516,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,

192
0:10:32.557,000 --> 0:10:35,000
so they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"

193
0:10:35.861,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.

194
0:10:38.788,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because —

195
0:10:42.909,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,

196
0:10:46.564,000 --> 0:10:48,000
over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.

197
0:10:49.029,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?

198
0:10:51.661,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.

199
0:10:54.797,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?

200
0:10:59.861,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The answer is, don't do things which are different.

201
0:11:02.564,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.

202
0:11:04.787,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.

203
0:11:07.399,000 --> 0:11:1,000
One, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,

204
0:11:11.25,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.

205
0:11:14.732,000 --> 0:11:17,000
On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,

206
0:11:17.964,000 --> 0:11:18,000
you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?

207
0:11:19.944,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.

208
0:11:23.556,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.

209
0:11:27.044,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation

210
0:11:29.773,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.

211
0:11:33.597,000 --> 0:11:35,000
When I realized the power of this new world,

212
0:11:35.637,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,

213
0:11:40.009,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,

214
0:11:43.804,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.

215
0:11:49.137,000 --> 0:11:52,000
If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,

216
0:11:52.186,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but I've applied them to myself for over a decade,

217
0:11:55.106,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,

218
0:11:58.855,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,

219
0:12:04.235,000 --> 0:12:06,000
so that when you go away and you're making your next

220
0:12:06.978,000 --> 0:12:1,000
absolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,

221
0:12:11.577,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense

222
0:12:14.657,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.

223
0:12:17.44,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

224
0:12:24.49,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Thank you, thank you. (Applause)

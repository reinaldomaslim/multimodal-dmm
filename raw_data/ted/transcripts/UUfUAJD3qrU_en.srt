1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's a great honor to be here with you.

2
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The good news is

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,

7
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but I have a box of slides.

8
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.

9
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I've learned through experience

10
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,

11
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures

12
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The whole story really starts

14
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

15
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.

16
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And on a Wednesday afternoon,

17
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was walking down the corridor of my high school

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
who made a great big old ceramic vessel,

20
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --

21
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic --

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.

23
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, I walked in the art room and I said, "What is that?"

24
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And he said, "Ceramics. And who are you?"

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I said, "I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that."

26
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you."

28
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And so for the remaining two years of my high school,

29
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I cut all my classes.

30
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But I had the presence of mind

32
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,

33
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and they gave me passing grades.

35
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And that's how I got out of high school.

36
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And Mr. Ross said,

37
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,

38
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me."

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh

40
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.

41
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Well, I'm now a trustee of the university,

42
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and at my installation ceremony I said,

43
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood

44
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who got into the place on probation.

45
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Don't give up on the poor kids, because you never know

46
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:41,000
what's going to happen to those children in life."

47
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes

48
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh

49
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with the highest crime rate.

50
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:56,000
One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school

51
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:,000
for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.

52
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?

53
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, we don't make any steel anymore,

54
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the people who used to make the steel

55
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are having a very tough time of it.

56
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I rebuild them and give them new life.

57
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.

58
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I was adopted

59
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,

60
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and he donated a row house. And in that row house

61
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,

62
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,

63
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
there's money in very close proximity.

64
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.

66
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And last year I spoke at his memorial service

67
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and wished him well in this life.

68
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,

69
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I asked him to build me a world class center

70
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

71
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.

72
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited --

73
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.

74
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's the building.

75
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.

76
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My view is that if you want to involve yourself

77
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the life of people who have been given up on,

78
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you have to look like the solution and not the problem.

79
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.

80
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one

81
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.

82
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,

84
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.

85
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:55,000
At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain

86
0:04:55,000 --> 0:05:,000
because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.

87
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids

88
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.

89
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime

90
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --

91
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and it sets an attitude and expectation

92
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.

93
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, from that fountain I built this building.

94
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste

95
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because I raised all the money.

96
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I said to my boy, "When you raise the money,

98
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we'll put your taste on the wall."

99
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy

100
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and everywhere your eye turns,

101
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there's something beautiful looking back at you,

102
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that's deliberate.

103
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's intentional.

104
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In my view, it is this kind of world

105
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that can redeem the soul of poor people.

106
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We also created a boardroom,

107
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,

108
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.

109
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We have since spun him off into his own business.

110
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.

111
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school

112
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers

113
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and single parents deserved to come to a school

114
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.

115
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people

116
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
long before you give them the speech.

117
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.

118
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Those are real and they're in my building every day.

119
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And now that I've given lots of speeches,

120
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,

121
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
and they said, "Mr. Strickland,

122
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
what an extraordinary story and what a great school.

123
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And we were particularly touched by the flowers

124
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."

125
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse

126
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there."

127
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.

128
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What you need to know is that the children

129
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and the adults deserve flowers in their life.

130
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.

131
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,

132
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we believe in hope and human possibilities.

133
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That happens to be at Christmas time.

134
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen

135
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that was built by the Heinz company -- you've heard of them?

136
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They did all right in the ketchup business.

137
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I happen to know that company pretty well

138
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator --

139
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
who was tragically killed in a plane accident --

140
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:03,000
he had heard about my desire to build a new building,

141
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag

142
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.

143
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And he called me into his office --

144
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz

145
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter) --

146
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.

147
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And he said, "But we've heard about you.

148
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,

149
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.

150
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And you could do us a great service

151
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:36,000
if you would add a culinary program to your program."

152
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Because back then, we were building a trades program.

153
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals

154
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for the Heinz company."

155
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field

156
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that I don't know much about, but I promise you

157
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built

158
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and in a couple of years, I'll come back

159
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and weigh out that program that you desire."

160
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,

161
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Well, what would your reaction be

162
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
if I said I'd give you a million dollars?"

163
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I said, "Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business."

164
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.

166
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And most importantly,

167
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.

168
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,

169
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,

170
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers

171
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.

172
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And we've never looked back.

173
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I would like to show you now some of the food

174
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.

175
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
That happens to be our cafeteria line.

176
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's puff pastry day. Why?

177
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
Because the students made puff pastry

178
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and that's what the school ate every day.

179
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.

180
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
That good food's not for rich people --

181
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
good food's for everybody on the planet,

182
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.

183
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program

184
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city

185
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,

186
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but it's better for their heads.

187
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life

188
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that they have value at this place I call my center.

189
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,

190
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem

191
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
by creating a world class environment,

192
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior

193
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
if you treat them in that way.

194
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:02,000
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing

195
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
after six months in the training program.

196
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:11,000
No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.

197
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people

198
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.

199
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's all in the way that you think about people

200
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that often determines their behavior.

201
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That was done by a student after seven months in the program,

202
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
done by a very brilliant young woman

203
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
who was taught by our pastry chef.

204
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.

205
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They have no calories.

207
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That's our dining room.

208
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It looks like your average high school cafeteria

209
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in your average town in America.

210
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,

211
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
particularly once they have been pushed aside.

212
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,

213
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we train medical technicians for the medical industry,

214
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we train chemical technicians for companies

215
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.

216
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --

217
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and you're all invited --

218
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry

219
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with logarithmic calculators

220
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
10 months from enrolling in the program.

221
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:35,000
There is absolutely no reason why poor people

222
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
can't learn world class technology.

223
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers

224
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,

225
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.

226
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.

227
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
We even teach people how to read.

228
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --

229
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
he's now an instructor.

230
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.

231
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And so you must ask yourself the question:

232
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:19,000
how is it possible in the 21st century

233
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that we graduate children from schools

234
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?

235
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed

236
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.

237
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I can take these children and in 20 weeks,

238
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.

239
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
No big deal.

240
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:5,000
That's our library with more handcrafted furniture.

241
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And this is the arts program I started in 1968.

242
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Remember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.

243
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience

244
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
with other kids in the neighborhood,

245
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food

246
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,

247
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
you can bring them right back to life.

248
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system

249
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that come to me every day of the week for arts education.

250
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And these are children who are flunking out of public school.

251
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college

252
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.

253
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We've made a fascinating discovery:

254
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
there's nothing wrong with the kids

255
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm

256
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and Herbie's music can't cure.

257
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.

258
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I beat out all the Ph.D.'s

259
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
because I figured that if you treat children like human beings,

260
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.

261
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And why we can't institute that policy

262
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in every school and in every city and every town

263
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
remains a mystery to me.

264
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Let me show you what these people do.

265
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.

266
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,

267
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists --

268
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there --

269
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and what we've learned

270
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is that the children will become like the people who teach them.

271
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,

272
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
an African-American woman

273
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,

274
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and let me show you what they did with the work.

275
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
These were children who the whole world had given up on,

276
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
who were flunking out of public school,

277
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and that's what they're capable of doing

278
0:15:54,000 --> 0:16:01,000
with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.

279
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
We teach photography.

280
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And these are examples of some of the kids' work.

281
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
That boy won a four-year scholarship

282
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
on the strength of that photograph.

283
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is our gallery.

284
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
We have a world class gallery

285
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,

286
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
so I designed this thing.

287
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
We have smoked salmon at the art openings,

288
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we have a formal printed invitation,

289
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.

290
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago

291
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.

292
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
He was dragging guys out of bars

293
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and saving those lives for the Lord.

294
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man.

295
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,

296
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but keep the enthusiasm.

297
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

298
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:,000
I can't get these parents to come to the school."

299
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
He said, "I'll get them to come to the school."

300
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,

301
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
"Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening

302
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
but you probably didn't have a ride.

303
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So, I came to give you a ride."

304
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.

305
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:19,000
At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up

306
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and we didn't pick up one parent.

307
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up

308
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild

309
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
because people think you're bad parents.

310
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And there is no statistical difference

311
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
between the white parents and the black parents.

312
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,

313
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:47,000
every time, every town, every city.

314
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.

315
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,

316
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:02,000
they've got four shows on their resume

317
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:05,000
before they apply to college because it's all up here.

318
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
You have to change the way that people see themselves

319
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
before you can change their behavior.

320
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And it's worked out pretty good up to this day.

321
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.

322
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:25,000
This is brand new.

323
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:29,000
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.

324
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley

325
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and I did all right.

326
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And the woman came out of the audience,

327
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:4,000
she said, "That was a great story

328
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and I was very impressed with your presentation.

329
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:45,000
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old."

330
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?"

331
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:52,000
She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."

332
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?"

333
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
She said, "Yes, sir."

334
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem."

335
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP

336
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and a furniture company called Steelcase

337
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:1,000
have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology

338
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:13,000
and all their furniture for the United States of America.

339
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And that's the room

340
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:17,000
that's initiating the relationship.

341
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:19,000
We got it just done in time to show you,

342
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:23,000
so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.

343
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:24,000
(Applause)

344
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:32,000
(Music)

345
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:34,000
I only have a couple more slides,

346
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.

347
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:4,000
So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes

348
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.

349
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:49,000
In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall

350
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:52,000
on the north end of the building while I was building it.

351
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:57,000
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there

352
0:19:57,000 --> 0:20:01,000
because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.

353
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:05,000
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check

354
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:07,000
on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,

355
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:1,000
"Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center

356
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:14,000
in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate

357
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:16,000
that doesn't even have a reputation in music?"

358
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
He said, "Because I heard you built the center

359
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:21,000
and I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.

360
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And now that I have, I want to give you a gift."

361
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
I said, "You're the gift."

362
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:3,000
He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.

363
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And I'm going to allow you to record the concert

364
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and I'm going to give you the music,

365
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:37,000
and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement

366
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:39,000
that says the money will come back and support the school."

367
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:44,000
And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,

368
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:48,000
but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.

369
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And he showed up and said,

370
0:20:5,000 --> 0:20:52,000
"Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,

371
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and I want to help you."

372
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:56,000
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.

373
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:,000
Then a bass player named Ray Brown,

374
0:21:,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,

375
0:21:03,000 --> 0:21:06,000
and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,

376
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:12,000
and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,

377
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and a fellow named Tito Puente,

378
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:2,000
and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,

379
0:21:2,000 --> 0:21:23,000
and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson

380
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:28,000
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park

381
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:31,000
to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.

382
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:35,000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,

383
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:38,000
I have now accumulated 600 recordings

384
0:21:38,000 --> 0:21:4,000
of the greatest artists in the world,

385
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:44,000
including Joe Williams, who died,

386
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:49,000
but not before his last recording was done at my school.

387
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:59,000
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder

388
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:06,000
and he said, "God's picked you, man, to do this work.

389
0:22:07,000 --> 0:22:1,000
And I want my music to be with you."

390
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:14,000
And that worked out all right.

391
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:19,000
When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school

392
0:22:19,000 --> 0:22:22,000
they voted to give me the rights to the music.

393
0:22:22,000 --> 0:22:27,000
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.

394
0:22:27,000 --> 0:22:3,000
And like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony

395
0:22:3,000 --> 0:22:32,000
because I didn't think we were going to win.

396
0:22:32,000 --> 0:22:34,000
Well, we did win,

397
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.

398
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:45,000
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them

399
0:22:45,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.

400
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:53,000
So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios

401
0:22:53,000 --> 0:22:55,000
in the United States of America

402
0:22:55,000 --> 0:22:56,000
(Laughter)

403
0:22:56,000 --> 0:23:01,000
in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.

404
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:08,000
That's the place all filled up with Republicans.

405
0:23:08,000 --> 0:23:12,000
(Laughter)

406
0:23:12,000 --> 0:23:13,000
(Applause)

407
0:23:13,000 --> 0:23:15,000
If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,

408
0:23:15,000 --> 0:23:17,000
you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania

409
0:23:17,000 --> 0:23:19,000
because it was all sitting there.

410
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:22,000
Including my mother and father, who lived long enough

411
0:23:22,000 --> 0:23:25,000
to see their kid build that building.

412
0:23:25,000 --> 0:23:29,000
And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.

413
0:23:29,000 --> 0:23:32,000
And he was there, Tito Puente.

414
0:23:32,000 --> 0:23:35,000
And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there

415
0:23:35,000 --> 0:23:37,000
and they recorded with us.

416
0:23:37,000 --> 0:23:42,000
And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.

417
0:23:42,000 --> 0:23:45,000
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing

418
0:23:45,000 --> 0:23:48,000
and that's where we recorded the first Grammy.

419
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:52,000
And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.

420
0:23:52,000 --> 0:23:56,000
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,

421
0:23:56,000 --> 0:24:04,000
who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.

422
0:24:04,000 --> 0:24:06,000
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey

423
0:24:06,000 --> 0:24:1,000
on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there

424
0:24:1,000 --> 0:24:12,000
singing excerpts from this album,

425
0:24:12,000 --> 0:24:16,000
the rights to which she donated to our school.

426
0:24:16,000 --> 0:24:18,000
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty

427
0:24:18,000 --> 0:24:23,000
that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.

428
0:24:23,000 --> 0:24:25,000
(Laughter)

429
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:28,000
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,

430
0:24:28,000 --> 0:24:3,000
right behind Tony Bennett.

431
0:24:3,000 --> 0:24:32,000
And I think we're going to be fine.

432
0:24:32,000 --> 0:24:36,000
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --

433
0:24:36,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and so I had another cardboard box built

434
0:24:39,000 --> 0:24:41,000
and I walked back out in the streets again.

435
0:24:41,000 --> 0:24:44,000
And that's the building, and that's the model,

436
0:24:44,000 --> 0:24:47,000
and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse

437
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:49,000
and in the middle's the medical technology building.

438
0:24:49,000 --> 0:24:52,000
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.

439
0:24:52,000 --> 0:24:57,000
It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --

440
0:24:57,000 --> 0:24:59,000
triple that in the middle of the inner city.

441
0:24:59,000 --> 0:25:01,000
And there's the fountain.

442
0:25:01,000 --> 0:25:03,000
(Laughter)

443
0:25:03,000 --> 0:25:05,000
Every building has a fountain.

444
0:25:05,000 --> 0:25:08,000
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants

445
0:25:08,000 --> 0:25:1,000
and they took half the building,

446
0:25:1,000 --> 0:25:13,000
and we now train medical technicians through all their system.

447
0:25:13,000 --> 0:25:15,000
And Mellon Bank's a tenant.

448
0:25:15,000 --> 0:25:18,000
And I love them because they pay the rent on time.

449
0:25:18,000 --> 0:25:19,000
(Laughter)

450
0:25:19,000 --> 0:25:21,000
And as a result of the association,

451
0:25:21,000 --> 0:25:23,000
I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation

452
0:25:24,000 --> 0:25:26,000
that bought Dreyfus.

453
0:25:29,000 --> 0:25:33,000
And this is in the process of being built as we speak.

454
0:25:33,000 --> 0:25:38,000
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse

455
0:25:38,000 --> 0:25:4,000
that's going to open in October this year

456
0:25:4,000 --> 0:25:44,000
because we're going to grow those flowers

457
0:25:44,000 --> 0:25:46,000
in the middle of the inner city.

458
0:25:46,000 --> 0:25:48,000
And we're going to have high school kids

459
0:25:48,000 --> 0:25:53,000
growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.

460
0:25:53,000 --> 0:25:57,000
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers

461
0:25:57,000 --> 0:26:02,000
to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.

462
0:26:02,000 --> 0:26:06,000
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,

463
0:26:06,000 --> 0:26:08,000
who are Hispanic.

464
0:26:08,000 --> 0:26:11,000
So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership

465
0:26:11,000 --> 0:26:15,000
to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.

466
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:18,000
And I told my United States senator

467
0:26:18,000 --> 0:26:2,000
that there was a very high probability

468
0:26:2,000 --> 0:26:22,000
that if he could find some funding for this,

469
0:26:22,000 --> 0:26:26,000
we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,

470
0:26:26,000 --> 0:26:28,000
to which he readily agreed.

471
0:26:28,000 --> 0:26:3,000
And we got the funding and we open in the fall.

472
0:26:3,000 --> 0:26:33,000
And you ought to come and see it -- it's going to be a hell of a story.

473
0:26:33,000 --> 0:26:38,000
And this is what I want to do when I grow up.

474
0:26:38,000 --> 0:26:4,000
(Laughter)

475
0:26:4,000 --> 0:26:43,000
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at

476
0:26:43,000 --> 0:26:46,000
and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.

477
0:26:46,000 --> 0:26:5,000
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --

478
0:26:5,000 --> 0:26:52,000
which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --

479
0:26:52,000 --> 0:26:55,000
for four million dollars and I didn't do it.

480
0:26:56,000 --> 0:27:,000
And I built the first building, and guess what happened?

481
0:27:,000 --> 0:27:04,000
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations

482
0:27:04,000 --> 0:27:1,000
and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,

483
0:27:1,000 --> 0:27:12,000
and said, "Mr. Strickland,

484
0:27:12,000 --> 0:27:14,000
you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award

485
0:27:14,000 --> 0:27:16,000
because you've appreciated our property values

486
0:27:16,000 --> 0:27:18,000
beyond our wildest expectations.

487
0:27:18,000 --> 0:27:21,000
Thank you very much for that."

488
0:27:21,000 --> 0:27:26,000
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,

489
0:27:26,000 --> 0:27:29,000
just in case they do come true.

490
0:27:29,000 --> 0:27:34,000
And finally, there's this picture.

491
0:27:35,000 --> 0:27:38,000
This is in a place called San Francisco.

492
0:27:38,000 --> 0:27:41,000
And the reason this picture's in here is

493
0:27:41,000 --> 0:27:45,000
I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,

494
0:27:45,000 --> 0:27:47,000
and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.

495
0:27:47,000 --> 0:27:49,000
He said, "Man, that's a great story.

496
0:27:49,000 --> 0:27:51,000
I want one of those."

497
0:27:51,000 --> 0:27:54,000
I said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?"

498
0:27:54,000 --> 0:27:56,000
He says, "I run the city of San Francisco.

499
0:27:56,000 --> 0:27:58,000
My name's Willie Brown."

500
0:27:59,000 --> 0:28:04,000
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise

501
0:28:04,000 --> 0:28:06,000
and put it out of my mind.

502
0:28:06,000 --> 0:28:08,000
And that weekend, I was going back home

503
0:28:08,000 --> 0:28:13,000
and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --

504
0:28:13,000 --> 0:28:15,000
first time I'd met him.

505
0:28:15,000 --> 0:28:18,000
And he walked in and he says, "What is this?"

506
0:28:18,000 --> 0:28:22,000
And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center

507
0:28:22,000 --> 0:28:24,000
for poor people."

508
0:28:24,000 --> 0:28:27,000
And he said, "As God as my witness,

509
0:28:27,000 --> 0:28:31,000
I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.

510
0:28:31,000 --> 0:28:33,000
And now I really want to build one."

511
0:28:33,000 --> 0:28:35,000
I said, "Well, where would you build this thing?"

512
0:28:35,000 --> 0:28:37,000
He said, "San Francisco."

513
0:28:37,000 --> 0:28:4,000
I said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?"

514
0:28:4,000 --> 0:28:42,000
(Laughter)

515
0:28:42,000 --> 0:28:45,000
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,

516
0:28:45,000 --> 0:28:48,000
and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,

517
0:28:48,000 --> 0:28:51,000
and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.

518
0:28:51,000 --> 0:28:55,000
And Willie Brown said, "As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,

519
0:28:55,000 --> 0:28:57,000
I'm going to build this thing

520
0:28:57,000 --> 0:29:01,000
as a legacy to the poor people of this city."

521
0:29:01,000 --> 0:29:05,000
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay

522
0:29:05,000 --> 0:29:09,000
and we got an architect and we got a general contractor

523
0:29:09,000 --> 0:29:11,000
and we got Herbie on the board,

524
0:29:12,000 --> 0:29:15,000
and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,

525
0:29:15,000 --> 0:29:18,000
and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo

526
0:29:18,000 --> 0:29:2,000
and Genentech.

527
0:29:2,000 --> 0:29:23,000
And along the way, I met this real short guy

528
0:29:24,000 --> 0:29:28,000
at my slide show in the Silicon Valley.

529
0:29:28,000 --> 0:29:3,000
He came up to me afterwards,

530
0:29:3,000 --> 0:29:33,000
he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.

531
0:29:33,000 --> 0:29:35,000
I want to help you."

532
0:29:35,000 --> 0:29:37,000
And I said, "Well, thank you very much for that.

533
0:29:37,000 --> 0:29:39,000
What do you do for a living?"

534
0:29:39,000 --> 0:29:43,000
He said, "Well, I built a company called eBay."

535
0:29:43,000 --> 0:29:45,000
I said, "Well, that's very nice.

536
0:29:45,000 --> 0:29:48,000
Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk."

537
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:53,000
I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,

538
0:29:53,000 --> 0:29:55,000
but I had the presence of mind to go back

539
0:29:55,000 --> 0:29:58,000
and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.

540
0:29:58,000 --> 0:30:,000
I said, "Hey man, what is eBay?"

541
0:30:,000 --> 0:30:03,000
He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network."

542
0:30:03,000 --> 0:30:05,000
I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing

543
0:30:05,000 --> 0:30:08,000
and he left me his card."

544
0:30:08,000 --> 0:30:11,000
So, I called him up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Skoll,

545
0:30:11,000 --> 0:30:15,000
I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are

546
0:30:15,000 --> 0:30:2,000
(Laughter)

547
0:30:2,000 --> 0:30:23,000
and I'd like to become your friend."

548
0:30:23,000 --> 0:30:26,000
(Laughter)

549
0:30:26,000 --> 0:30:29,000
And Jeff and I did become friends,

550
0:30:29,000 --> 0:30:32,000
and he's organized a team of people

551
0:30:32,000 --> 0:30:35,000
and we're going to build this center.

552
0:30:37,000 --> 0:30:43,000
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,

553
0:30:43,000 --> 0:30:46,000
and I said, "The mayor sent me down here to work with you

554
0:30:47,000 --> 0:30:5,000
and I want to build a center with you,

555
0:30:5,000 --> 0:30:53,000
but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.

556
0:30:53,000 --> 0:30:56,000
And all I've got is a box of slides."

557
0:30:56,000 --> 0:31:02,000
And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people

558
0:31:02,000 --> 0:31:05,000
on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken

559
0:31:05,000 --> 0:31:08,000
and it was 100 degrees outside,

560
0:31:09,000 --> 0:31:11,000
and I started showing these pictures.

561
0:31:11,000 --> 0:31:15,000
And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.

562
0:31:15,000 --> 0:31:2,000
And I ran the story and I said, "What do you think?"

563
0:31:2,000 --> 0:31:23,000
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,

564
0:31:23,000 --> 0:31:26,000
"In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,

565
0:31:26,000 --> 0:31:3,000
you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.

566
0:31:3,000 --> 0:31:33,000
I'm going with you, man."

567
0:31:33,000 --> 0:31:36,000
And she turned that audience around on a pin.

568
0:31:36,000 --> 0:31:4,000
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,

569
0:31:4,000 --> 0:31:42,000
and we're going to build it all right.

570
0:31:42,000 --> 0:31:45,000
And I think we can get in the ground this year

571
0:31:45,000 --> 0:31:49,000
as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.

572
0:31:49,000 --> 0:31:55,000
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way

573
0:31:55,000 --> 0:31:59,000
and I showed him the box of slides.

574
0:31:59,000 --> 0:32:02,000
And Quincy said, "I want to help you, man.

575
0:32:02,000 --> 0:32:06,000
Let's do one in L.A."

576
0:32:06,000 --> 0:32:09,000
And so he's assembled a group of people.

577
0:32:09,000 --> 0:32:11,000
And I've fallen in love with him,

578
0:32:11,000 --> 0:32:15,000
as I have with Herbie and with his music.

579
0:32:15,000 --> 0:32:21,000
And Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"

580
0:32:21,000 --> 0:32:24,000
And I said, "It came from your music, man.

581
0:32:24,000 --> 0:32:27,000
Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums

582
0:32:27,000 --> 0:32:3,000
when I was 16 years old in the pottery class,

583
0:32:3,000 --> 0:32:33,000
when the world was all dark,

584
0:32:33,000 --> 0:32:37,000
and your music got me to the sunlight."

585
0:32:37,000 --> 0:32:39,000
And I said, "If I can follow that music,

586
0:32:39,000 --> 0:32:43,000
I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.

587
0:32:43,000 --> 0:32:48,000
And if that's not true, how did I get here?"

588
0:32:48,000 --> 0:32:52,000
I want you all to know

589
0:32:52,000 --> 0:32:56,000
that I think the world is a place that's worth living.

590
0:32:56,000 --> 0:33:,000
I believe in you.

591
0:33:,000 --> 0:33:04,000
I believe in your hopes and your dreams,

592
0:33:04,000 --> 0:33:07,000
I believe in your intelligence

593
0:33:07,000 --> 0:33:09,000
and I believe in your enthusiasm.

594
0:33:09,000 --> 0:33:12,000
And I'm tired of living like this,

595
0:33:12,000 --> 0:33:17,000
going into town after town with people standing around on corners

596
0:33:17,000 --> 0:33:23,000
with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.

597
0:33:24,000 --> 0:33:28,000
We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.

598
0:33:28,000 --> 0:33:34,000
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,

599
0:33:34,000 --> 0:33:36,000
most of whom look like me.

600
0:33:36,000 --> 0:33:4,000
It's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.

601
0:33:4,000 --> 0:33:44,000
It's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.

602
0:33:44,000 --> 0:33:49,000
Do the math -- it will never work.

603
0:33:49,000 --> 0:33:51,000
I am banking on you

604
0:33:51,000 --> 0:33:59,000
and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard

605
0:34:,000 --> 0:34:06,000
and very decent people who still believe in something.

606
0:34:06,000 --> 0:34:15,000
And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.

607
0:34:15,000 --> 0:34:17,000
And I don't think I'm crazy.

608
0:34:17,000 --> 0:34:19,000
I think we can get home on this thing

609
0:34:19,000 --> 0:34:22,000
and I think we can build these all over the country

610
0:34:22,000 --> 0:34:26,000
for less money than we're spending on prisons.

611
0:34:26,000 --> 0:34:28,000
And I believe we can turn this whole story around

612
0:34:29,000 --> 0:34:33,000
to one of celebration and one of hope.

613
0:34:33,000 --> 0:34:36,000
In my business it's very difficult work.

614
0:34:36,000 --> 0:34:39,000
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon --

615
0:34:39,000 --> 0:34:42,000
never enough money, too much need --

616
0:34:42,000 --> 0:34:44,000
and so there is a tendency

617
0:34:44,000 --> 0:34:48,000
to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.

618
0:34:48,000 --> 0:34:54,000
And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:

619
0:34:54,000 --> 0:35:,000
you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.

620
0:35:,000 --> 0:35:05,000
And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.

621
0:35:05,000 --> 0:35:08,000
And thanks for listening to what I had to say.

622
0:35:08,000 --> 0:35:22,000
(Applause)

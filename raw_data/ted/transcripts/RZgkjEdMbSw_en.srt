1
0:00:12.708,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My parents gave me an extraordinary name:

2
0:00:17.458,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Baratunde Rafiq Thurston.

3
0:00:23.25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, Baratunde is based on a Yoruba name from Nigeria,

4
0:00:26.417,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but we're not Nigerian.

5
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:29.042,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That's just how black my mama was.

7
0:00:31.042,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:32.083,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Get this boy the blackest name possible. What does the book say?"

9
0:00:35.25,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:36.833,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Rafiq is an Arabic name, but we are not Arabs.

11
0:00:40.583,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My mom just wanted me to have difficulty boarding planes in the 21st century.

12
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.042,000 --> 0:00:48,000
She foresaw America's turn toward nativism.

14
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She was a black futurist.

15
0:00:50.625,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:52.333,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Thurston is a British name, but we are not British.

17
0:00:57.125,000 --> 0:01:,000
Shoutout to the multigenerational, dehumanizing economic institution

18
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of American chattel slavery, though.

19
0:01:03.25,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Also, Thurston makes for a great Starbucks name.

20
0:01:05.708,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Really expedites the process.

21
0:01:07.458,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:11.417,000 --> 0:01:14,000
My mother was a renaissance woman.

23
0:01:14.708,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Arnita Lorraine Thurston

24
0:01:17.292,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was a computer programmer, former domestic worker,

25
0:01:20.083,000 --> 0:01:22,000
survivor of sexual assault,

26
0:01:22.292,000 --> 0:01:24,000
an artist and an activist.

27
0:01:24.875,000 --> 0:01:28,000
She prepared me for this world with lessons in black history,

28
0:01:29.042,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in martial arts, in urban farming,

29
0:01:31.833,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and then she sent me in the seventh grade to the private Sidwell Friends School,

30
0:01:35.75,000 --> 0:01:37,000
where US presidents send their daughters,

31
0:01:38.25,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and where she sent me looking like this.

32
0:01:40.833,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:44.167,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I had two key tasks going to that school:

34
0:01:47.25,000 --> 0:01:49,000
don't lose your blackness and don't lose your glasses.

35
0:01:49.833,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This accomplished both.

36
0:01:51.833,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:55.667,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Sidwell was a great place to learn the arts and the sciences,

38
0:01:58.917,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but also the art of living amongst whiteness.

39
0:02:03.125,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That would prepare me for life later at Harvard,

40
0:02:06.083,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or doing corporate consulting,

41
0:02:07.583,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or for my jobs at "The Daily Show" and "The Onion."

42
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I would write down many of these lessons in my memoir, "How to Be Black,"

43
0:02:13.542,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which if you haven't read yet, makes you a racist, because --

44
0:02:16.833,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:18.083,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you've had plenty of time to read the book.

46
0:02:23.208,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But America insists on reminding me

47
0:02:26.292,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and teaching me

48
0:02:27.75,000 --> 0:02:3,000
what it means to be black in America.

49
0:02:30.917,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's December 2018,

50
0:02:32.917,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm with my fiancé in the suburbs of Wisconsin.

51
0:02:36.667,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We are visiting her parents, both of whom are white,

52
0:02:39.792,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which makes her white.

53
0:02:41.083,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That's how it works. I don't make the rules.

54
0:02:43.208,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:44.375,000 --> 0:02:48,000
She's had some drinks, so I drive us in her parents' car,

56
0:02:48.667,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we get pulled over by the police.

57
0:02:51.875,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm scared.

58
0:02:53.333,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I turn on the flashing lights to indicate compliance.

59
0:02:56.833,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I pull over slowly

60
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:03:,000
under the brightest streetlight I can find

61
0:03:00.917,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in case I need witnesses or dashcam footage.

62
0:03:05.417,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We get out my identification, the car registration,

63
0:03:08.5,000 --> 0:03:1,000
lay it out in the open, roll down the windows,

64
0:03:10.708,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my hands are placed on the steering wheel,

65
0:03:13.042,000 --> 0:03:16,000
all before the officer exits the vehicle.

66
0:03:17.292,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is how to stay alive.

67
0:03:21.042,000 --> 0:03:24,000
As we wait, I think about these headlines --

68
0:03:24.292,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Police shoot another unarmed black person" --

69
0:03:28.083,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I don't want to join them.

70
0:03:31.208,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The good news is, our officer was friendly.

71
0:03:34.375,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She told us our tags were expired.

72
0:03:37.125,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So to all the white parents out there,

73
0:03:39.042,000 --> 0:03:41,000
if your child is involved with a person

74
0:03:41.5,000 --> 0:03:44,000
whose skin tone is rated Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson or darker --

75
0:03:44.875,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:47.417,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you need to get that car inspected, update the paperwork every time we visit.

77
0:03:51.083,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's just common courtesy.

78
0:03:52.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:53.792,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

80
0:03:57.417,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I got lucky.

81
0:03:59.458,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I got a law enforcement professional.

82
0:04:02.625,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I survived something that should not require survival.

83
0:04:07.375,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I think about this series of stories --

84
0:04:10.375,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Police shoot another unarmed black person" --

85
0:04:13.042,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and that season when those stories popped up everywhere.

86
0:04:17.417,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I would scroll through my feed

87
0:04:19.542,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I would see a baby announcement photo.

88
0:04:22.208,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I'd see an ad for a product

89
0:04:24.125,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I had just whispered to a friend about yesterday.

90
0:04:27.542,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I would see a video of a police officer gunning down someone

91
0:04:30.75,000 --> 0:04:31,000
who looked just like me.

92
0:04:32.708,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I'd see a think piece

93
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
about how millennials have replaced sex with avocado toast.

94
0:04:37.167,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:38.792,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It was a confusing time.

96
0:04:41.542,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Those stories kept popping up,

97
0:04:43.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but in 2018, those stories got changed out for a different type of story,

98
0:04:49.542,000 --> 0:04:53,000
stories like, "White Woman Calls Cops On Black Woman Waiting For An Uber."

99
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That was Brooklyn Becky.

100
0:04:56.583,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Then there was, "White Woman Calls Police

101
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
On Eight-Year-Old Black Girl Selling Water."

102
0:05:00.708,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That was Permit Patty.

103
0:05:02.167,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Then there was, "Woman Calls Police

104
0:05:03.917,000 --> 0:05:05,000
On Black Family BBQing At Lake In Oakland."

105
0:05:06.458,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That was now infamous BBQ Becky.

106
0:05:10.167,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I contend that these stories of living while black

107
0:05:13.375,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are actually progress.

108
0:05:15.167,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We used to find out after the extrajudicial police killings.

109
0:05:19.167,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, we're getting video of people calling 911.

110
0:05:22.167,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We're moving upstream,

111
0:05:23.917,000 --> 0:05:26,000
closer to the problem and closer to the solution.

112
0:05:27.917,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I started a collection

113
0:05:30.542,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of as many of these stories as I could find.

114
0:05:33.042,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I built an evolving, still-growing database

115
0:05:35.792,000 --> 0:05:37,000
at baratunde.com/livingwhileblack.

116
0:05:38.667,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Seeking understanding, I realized the process

117
0:05:41.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
was really diagramming sentences to understand these headlines.

118
0:05:46.625,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I want to thank my Sidwell English teacher Erica Berry

119
0:05:49.958,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and all English teachers.

120
0:05:51.417,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You have given us tools to fight for our own freedom.

121
0:05:55.583,000 --> 0:05:57,000
What I found was a process to break down the headline

122
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:,000
and understand the consistent layers

123
0:06:01.333,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in each one:

124
0:06:02.708,000 --> 0:06:06,000
a subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity,

125
0:06:07.5,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so that "White Woman Calls Police On Eight-Year-Old Black Girl"

126
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is the same as "White Man Calls Police On Black Woman Using Neighborhood Pool"

127
0:06:16.167,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is the same as "Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker

128
0:06:19.625,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Campaigning In Her District."

129
0:06:22.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They're the same.

130
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Diagramming the sentences allowed me to diagram the white supremacy

131
0:06:29.208,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which allowed such sentences to be true,

132
0:06:31.167,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and I will pause to define my terms.

133
0:06:34.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
When I say "white supremacy,"

134
0:06:35.583,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm not just talking about Nazis

135
0:06:38.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or white power activists,

136
0:06:40.042,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and I'm definitely not saying that all white people are racist.

137
0:06:44.667,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What I'm referring to

138
0:06:46.167,000 --> 0:06:51,000
is a system of structural advantage that favors white people over others

139
0:06:51.542,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in social, economic and political arenas.

140
0:06:54.25,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's what Bryan Stevenson at the Equal Justice Initiative

141
0:06:57.542,000 --> 0:06:59,000
calls the narrative of racial difference,

142
0:07:00.375,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the story we told ourselves to justify slavery and Jim Crow

143
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and mass incarceration and beyond.

144
0:07:07.667,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So when I saw this pattern repeating,

145
0:07:10.917,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I got angry,

146
0:07:12.75,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but I also got inspired

147
0:07:15.333,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to create a game,

148
0:07:17.25,000 --> 0:07:22,000
a game of words that would allow me to transform this traumatic exposure

149
0:07:22.625,000 --> 0:07:24,000
into more of a healing experience.

150
0:07:25.583,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I'm going to talk you through the game.

151
0:07:27.708,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The first level is a training level, and I need your participation.

152
0:07:31.458,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Our objective: to determine if this is real or fake.

153
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Did this happen or not?

154
0:07:36.625,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Here is the example:

155
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"Catholic University Law Librarian Calls Police On Student

156
0:07:42.083,000 --> 0:07:44,000
For 'Being Argumentative.'"

157
0:07:44.375,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Clap your hands if you think this is real.

158
0:07:46.625,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

159
0:07:49.958,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Clap your hands if you think this is fake.

160
0:07:52.292,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

161
0:07:55.542,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The reals have it, unfortunately,

162
0:07:58.333,000 --> 0:08:,000
and a point of information,

163
0:08:00.542,000 --> 0:08:02,000
being argumentative in a law library

164
0:08:02.958,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is the exact right place to do that.

165
0:08:05.083,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:06.208,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This student should be promoted to professor.

167
0:08:09.167,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Training level complete, so we move on to the real levels.

168
0:08:12.542,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Level one, our objective is simple:

169
0:08:15.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
reverse the roles.

170
0:08:17.167,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That means "Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker"

171
0:08:20.292,000 --> 0:08:23,000
becomes "Black Oregon Lawmaker Calls Cops On Woman."

172
0:08:24.208,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That means "White Man Calls Police On Black Woman

173
0:08:26.875,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Using Neighborhood Pool"

174
0:08:28.5,000 --> 0:08:32,000
becomes "Black Woman Calls Police On White Man Using Neighborhood Pool."

175
0:08:33.167,000 --> 0:08:35,000
How do you like them reverse racist apples?

176
0:08:36.625,000 --> 0:08:38,000
That's it, level one complete,

177
0:08:39.125,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and so we level up to level two,

178
0:08:41.917,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where our objective is to increase the believability of the reversal.

179
0:08:46.375,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Let's face it, a black woman calling police on a white man using a pool

180
0:08:49.732,000 --> 0:08:5,000
isn't absurd enough,

181
0:08:51.667,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but what if that white man was trying to touch her hair without asking,

182
0:08:56.917,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or maybe he was making oat milk while riding a unicycle,

183
0:09:02.417,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or maybe he's just talking over everyone in a meeting.

184
0:09:05.333,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:06.542,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We've all been there, right?

186
0:09:08.583,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Seriously, we've all been there.

187
0:09:11.917,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So that's it, level two complete.

188
0:09:14.917,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But it comes with a warning:

189
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
simply reversing the flow of injustice is not justice.

190
0:09:21.833,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That is vengeance, that is not our mission,

191
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that's a different game so we level up to level three,

192
0:09:28.417,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where the objective is to change the action,

193
0:09:31.5,000 --> 0:09:34,000
also known as "calling the police is not your only option

194
0:09:35.042,000 --> 0:09:36,000
OMG, what is wrong with you people!"

195
0:09:36.792,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Applause)

196
0:09:38.25,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I need to pause the game to remind us of the structure.

197
0:09:42.542,000 --> 0:09:46,000
A subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity.

198
0:09:47.417,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"White Woman Calls Police On Black Real Estate Investor

199
0:09:50.333,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Inspecting His Own Property."

200
0:09:52.458,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"California Safeway Calls Cops On Black Woman

201
0:09:55.292,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Donating Food To The Homeless."

202
0:09:57.875,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Gold Club Twice Calls Cops On Black Women For Playing Too Slow."

203
0:10:03.667,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In all these cases, the subject is usually white,

204
0:10:07.208,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the target is usually black,

205
0:10:09.208,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and the activities are anything,

206
0:10:11.917,000 --> 0:10:13,000
from sitting in a Starbucks

207
0:10:14.583,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to using the wrong type of barbecue

208
0:10:17.042,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to napping

209
0:10:18.417,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to walking "agitated" on the way to work,

210
0:10:21.667,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which I just call "walking to work."

211
0:10:24.042,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:25.625,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And, my personal favorite,

213
0:10:27.708,000 --> 0:10:3,000
not stopping his dog from humping her dog,

214
0:10:31.708,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which is clearly a case for dog police,

215
0:10:34.333,000 --> 0:10:35,000
not people police.

216
0:10:36.625,000 --> 0:10:4,000
All of these activities add up to living.

217
0:10:42.292,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Our existence is being interpreted as crime.

218
0:10:47.125,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, this is the obligatory moment in the presentation where I have to say,

219
0:10:50.958,000 --> 0:10:52,000
not everything is about race.

220
0:10:53.25,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Crime is a thing, should be reported,

221
0:10:55.833,000 --> 0:11:,000
but ask yourself, do we need armed men to show up and resolve this situation,

222
0:11:01.833,000 --> 0:11:03,000
because when they show up for me,

223
0:11:04.375,000 --> 0:11:05,000
it's different.

224
0:11:06.417,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We know that police officers

225
0:11:08.917,000 --> 0:11:12,000
use force more with black people than with white people,

226
0:11:13.375,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we are learning the role of 911 calls in this.

227
0:11:17.042,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Thanks to preliminary research from the Center for Policing Equity,

228
0:11:20.667,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we're learning that in some cities,

229
0:11:22.417,000 --> 0:11:24,000
most of the interactions between cops and citizens

230
0:11:25.042,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is due to 911 calls,

231
0:11:26.875,000 --> 0:11:28,000
not officer-initiated stops,

232
0:11:28.958,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and most of the violence, the use of force by police on citizens,

233
0:11:32.875,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is in response to those calls.

234
0:11:35.083,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Further, when those officers responding to calls use force,

235
0:11:39.25,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that increases in areas

236
0:11:41.625,000 --> 0:11:43,000
where the percentage of the white population

237
0:11:43.75,000 --> 0:11:44,000
has also increased,

238
0:11:45.083,000 --> 0:11:47,000
aka gentrification,

239
0:11:47.167,000 --> 0:11:49,000
aka unicycles and oat milk,

240
0:11:50.083,000 --> 0:11:52,000
aka when BBQ Becky feels threatened,

241
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
she becomes a threat to me in my own neighborhood,

242
0:11:57.333,000 --> 0:11:59,000
which forces me and people like me

243
0:11:59.667,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to police ourselves.

244
0:12:01.708,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We quiet ourselves, we walk on eggshells,

245
0:12:04.75,000 --> 0:12:06,000
we maybe pull over to the side of the road

246
0:12:07.458,000 --> 0:12:08,000
under the brightest light we can find

247
0:12:09.458,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so that our murder

248
0:12:11.333,000 --> 0:12:13,000
might be caught cleanly on camera,

249
0:12:14.25,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and we do this because we live in a system

250
0:12:17.25,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in which white people can too easily call on deadly force

251
0:12:21.292,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to ensure their comfort.

252
0:12:24.542,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

253
0:12:30.042,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The California Safeway

254
0:12:31.375,000 --> 0:12:35,000
didn't just call cops on black woman donating food to homeless.

255
0:12:36.208,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They ordered armed, unaccountable men upon her.

256
0:12:39.625,000 --> 0:12:41,000
They essentially called in a drone strike.

257
0:12:43.125,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is weaponized discomfort,

258
0:12:46.583,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and it is not new.

259
0:12:48.958,000 --> 0:12:5,000
From 1877 to 1950,

260
0:12:51.333,000 --> 0:12:56,000
there were at least 4,400 documented racial terror lynchings of black people

261
0:12:56.875,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the United States.

262
0:12:58.792,000 --> 0:13:,000
They had headlines as well.

263
0:13:01.042,000 --> 0:13:04,000
"Rev. T.A. Allen was lynched in Hernando, Mississippi

264
0:13:04.458,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for organizing local sharecroppers."

265
0:13:07.667,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"Oliver Moore was lynched in Edgecomb County, North Carolina,

266
0:13:10.542,000 --> 0:13:11,000
for frightening a white girl."

267
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:14,000
"Nathan Bird was lynched near Luling, Texas,

268
0:13:14.083,000 --> 0:13:17,000
for refusing to turn his son over to a mob."

269
0:13:18.417,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We need to change the action,

270
0:13:20.792,000 --> 0:13:21,000
whether that action is "lynches"

271
0:13:22.667,000 --> 0:13:24,000
or "calls police."

272
0:13:24.75,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And now that I have shortened the distance between those two,

273
0:13:28.292,000 --> 0:13:3,000
let's get back to our game, to our mission.

274
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Our objective in level three is to change the action.

275
0:13:34.042,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So what if, instead of

276
0:13:35.875,000 --> 0:13:37,000
"Calls Cops On Black Woman Donating Food To Homeless,"

277
0:13:38.833,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that California Safeway simply thanks her.

278
0:13:42.5,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Thanking is far cheaper than bringing law enforcement to the scene.

279
0:13:45.75,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

280
0:13:47.042,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Or, instead,

281
0:13:49.458,000 --> 0:13:51,000
they could give the food they would have wasted to her,

282
0:13:52.083,000 --> 0:13:53,000
upped their civic cred.

283
0:13:54.708,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Or, the white woman who called the police on the eight-year-old black girl,

284
0:13:58.292,000 --> 0:14:01,000
she could have bought all the inventory from that little black girl,

285
0:14:01.708,000 --> 0:14:03,000
support a small business.

286
0:14:03.917,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And the white woman who called the police on the black real estate investor,

287
0:14:07.542,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we would all be better off, the cops agree,

288
0:14:09.625,000 --> 0:14:11,000
if she had simply ignored him and minded her own damn business.

289
0:14:12.625,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

290
0:14:14.208,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Minding one's own damn business is an excellent choice, excellent choice.

291
0:14:18.667,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Choose it more often.

292
0:14:20.5,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Level three is complete, but there is a final bonus level,

293
0:14:25.125,000 --> 0:14:27,000
where the objective is inclusion.

294
0:14:27.917,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We have also seen headlines like this:

295
0:14:30.417,000 --> 0:14:32,000
"Powerful Man Masturbates In Front Of Young Women

296
0:14:33.417,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Visiting His Office."

297
0:14:35.542,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What an odd choice for powerful man to make.

298
0:14:39.333,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So many other actions available to him.

299
0:14:42.25,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Laughter)

300
0:14:43.292,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Like, such as, "listens to,"

301
0:14:46.958,000 --> 0:14:47,000
"mentors,"

302
0:14:48.25,000 --> 0:14:52,000
"inspired by, starts joint venture, everybody rich now."

303
0:14:52.542,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Laughter)

304
0:14:53.833,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I want to live in that world of everybody rich now,

305
0:14:56.292,000 --> 0:14:59,000
but because of his poor choice, we are all in a poorer world.

306
0:15:01.125,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Doesn't have to be this way.

307
0:15:03.083,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This word game reminded me that there is a structure to white supremacy,

308
0:15:07.667,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as there is to misogyny,

309
0:15:09.292,000 --> 0:15:12,000
as there is to all systemic abuses of power.

310
0:15:12.667,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Structure is what makes them systemic.

311
0:15:17.083,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I'm asking people here

312
0:15:19.042,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to see the structure,

313
0:15:21.125,000 --> 0:15:23,000
where the power is in it,

314
0:15:23.542,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and even more importantly to see the humanity

315
0:15:26.917,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of those of us made targets by this structure.

316
0:15:31.042,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I am here because I was loved and invested in and protected and lucky,

317
0:15:37.208,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because I went to the right schools, I'm semifamous, mostly happy,

318
0:15:40.375,000 --> 0:15:41,000
meditate twice a day,

319
0:15:42.167,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and yet,

320
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I walk around in fear,

321
0:15:46.417,000 --> 0:15:5,000
because I know that someone seeing me as a threat

322
0:15:50.875,000 --> 0:15:52,000
can become a threat to my life,

323
0:15:53.375,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and I am tired.

324
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I am tired of carrying

325
0:15:57.458,000 --> 0:16:,000
this invisible burden of other people's fears,

326
0:16:01.333,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and many of us are,

327
0:16:03.417,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and we shouldn't have to,

328
0:16:05.625,000 --> 0:16:07,000
because we can change this,

329
0:16:08.542,000 --> 0:16:12,000
because we can change the action, which changes the story,

330
0:16:13.083,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which changes the system

331
0:16:16.292,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that allows those stories to happen.

332
0:16:18.167,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Systems are just collective stories we all buy into.

333
0:16:23.083,000 --> 0:16:25,000
When we change them,

334
0:16:25.25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
we write a better reality for us all to be a part of.

335
0:16:29.792,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I am asking us

336
0:16:31.917,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to use our power to choose.

337
0:16:34.417,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I am asking us to level up.

338
0:16:37.958,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Thank you.

339
0:16:39.25,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I am Baratunde Rafiq Thurston.

340
0:16:41.708,000 --> 0:16:45,000

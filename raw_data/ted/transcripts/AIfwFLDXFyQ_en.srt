1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Sometimes I go browsing

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
[through] a very old magazine.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I found this observation test

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
about the story of the ark.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And the artist that drew this observation test

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
did some errors, had some mistakes --

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
there are more or less 12 mistakes.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Some of them are very easy.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There is a funnel, an aerial part,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Some of them are about the animals, the number.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But there is a much more fundamental mistake

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in the overall story of the ark

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that's not reported here.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And this problem is: where are the plants?

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So now we have God

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that is going to submerge Earth permanently

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or at least for a very long period,

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and no one is taking care of plants.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird,

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of every kind of animal,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of every kind of creature that moves,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but no mention about plants.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Why?

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In another part of the same story,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
all the living creatures

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
are just the living creatures

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that came out from the ark,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so birds, livestock and wild animals.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Plants are not living creatures --

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
this is the point.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That is a point that is not

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
coming out from the Bible,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but it's something that

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
really accompanied humanity.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Let's have a look at this nice code

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that is coming from a Renaissance book.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Here we have the description

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the order of nature.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's a nice description because it's starting from left --

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you have the stones --

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
immediately after the stones, the plants

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that are just able to live.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and on the top of the pyramid,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
there is the man.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This is not the common man.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is quite comforting

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for people like me -- I'm a professor --

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
this to be over there on the top of creation.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But it's something completely wrong.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You know very well about professors.

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But it's also wrong about plants,

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because plants are not just able to live;

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
they are able to sense.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They are much more sophisticated

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in sensing than animals.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Just to give you an example,

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
every single root apex

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is able to detect and to monitor

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
concurrently and continuously

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
at least 15 different chemical

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and physical parameters.

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And they also are able to show and to exhibit

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
such a wonderful and complex behavior

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that can be described just with the term of intelligence.

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, but this is something --

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
this underestimation of plants is something

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that is always with us.

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Let's have a look at this short movie now.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We have David Attenborough.

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover;

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
he did some of the most beautiful movies

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
about plant behavior.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, when he speaks about plants,

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
everything is correct.

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When he speaks about animals,

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
[he] tends to remove the fact

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that plants exist.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The blue whale,

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the biggest creature that exists on the planet --

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that is wrong, completely wrong.

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The blue whale, it's a dwarf

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
if compared with the real biggest creature

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that exists on the planet --

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that is, this wonderful,

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause)

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And this is a living organism

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, the story

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that plants are some low-level organisms

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
has been formalized

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
many times ago by Aristotle,

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that in "De Anima" --

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that is a very influential book for the Western civilization --

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
wrote that the plants are on the edge

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
between living and not living.

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's called the vegetative soul,

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because they lack movement,

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and so they don't need to sense.

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Let's see.

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is a very fast movement.

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
hunting snails --

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
sorry for the snail.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This has been something that has been refused for centuries,

111
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
despite the evidence.

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because it was against the order of nature.

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
But plants are also able

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to show a lot of movement.

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering.

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's just a question to use some techniques

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
like the time lapse.

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Some of them are much more sophisticated.

120
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Look at this young bean

121
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that is moving to catch the light every time.

122
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's really so graceful;

123
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it's like a dancing angel.

124
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They are also able to play --

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they are really playing.

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
These are young sunflowers,

127
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and what they are doing

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
cannot be described

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
with any other terms than playing.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They are training themselves,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
as many young animals do,

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to the adult life

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
where they will be called to track the sun

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
all the day.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They are able to respond to gravity, of course,

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so the shoots are growing

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
against the vector of gravity

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the roots toward the vector of gravity.

139
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But they are also able to sleep.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is one, Mimosa pudica.

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So during the night,

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they curl the leaves

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and reduce the movement,

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
there is much more movement.

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This is interesting

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because this sleeping machinery,

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it's perfectly conserved.

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's the same in plants, in insects

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and in animals.

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem,

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it's easy to study on plants, for example,

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
than in animals

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and it's much more easy even ethically.

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's a kind of vegetarian

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
experimentation.

157
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Plants are even able to communicate --

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they are extraordinary communicators.

159
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They communicate with other plants.

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They communicate

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with plants of other species

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and they communicate with animals

164
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
by producing chemical volatiles,

165
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
for example, during the pollination.

166
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because they move the pollen from one flower to the other,

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
yet they cannot move from one flower to the other.

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So they need a vector --

170
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and this vector,

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it's normally an animal.

172
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Many insects

173
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
have been used by plants as vectors

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
for the transport of the pollination,

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but not just insects; even birds, reptiles,

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and mammals like bats rats

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
are normally used for the transportation of the pollen.

178
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is a serious business.

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We have the plants that are giving to the animals

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a kind of sweet substance --

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
very energizing --

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
having in change this transportation of the pollen.

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But some plants are manipulating animals,

184
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
like in the case of orchids

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that promise sex and nectar

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and give in change nothing

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
for the transportation of the pollen.

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, there is a big problem

189
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
behind all this behavior that we have seen.

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
How is it possible to do this without a brain?

191
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We need to wait until 1880,

192
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when this big man,

193
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Charles Darwin,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
publishes a wonderful, astonishing book

195
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that starts a revolution.

196
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
before Charles Darwin.

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
In his book,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
assisted by his son, Francis --

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they took into consideration every single movement

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
for 500 pages.

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And in the last paragraph of the book,

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it's a kind of stylistic mark,

206
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because normally Charles Darwin stored,

207
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in the last paragraph of a book,

208
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the most important message.

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He wrote that,

210
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"It's hardly an exaggeration

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to say that the tip of the radical

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
acts like the brain

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of one of the lower animals."

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is not a metaphor.

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends

216
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so the maximum scientific authority in Britain

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
speaking about the brain in the plants.

219
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, this is a root apex

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
growing against a slope.

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So you can recognize this kind of movement,

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the same movement that worms, snakes

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and every animal

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that are moving on the ground without legs

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is able to display.

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And it's not an easy movement

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because, to have this kind of movement,

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you need to move different regions of the root

229
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and to synchronize these different regions

230
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
without having a brain.

231
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we studied the root apex

232
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and we found that there is a specific region

233
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that is here, depicted in blue --

234
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that is called the "transition zone."

235
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And this region, it's a very small region --

236
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
it's less than one millimeter.

237
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And in this small region

238
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
you have the highest consumption

239
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of oxygen in the plants

240
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and more important,

241
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you have these kinds of signals here.

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential,

243
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
are the same signals

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that the neurons of my brain, of our brain,

245
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
use to exchange information.

246
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now we know that a root apex

247
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
has just a few hundred cells

248
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that show this kind of feature,

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but we know how big

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We have almost

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
14 million roots.

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We have 11 and a half million

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
root apex

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and a total length of 600 or more kilometers

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and a very high surface area.

257
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Now let's imagine

258
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that each single root apex

259
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is working in network with all the others.

260
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Here were have on the left, the Internet

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and on the right, the root apparatus.

262
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They work in the same way.

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They are a network

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of small computing machines,

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
working in networks.

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And why are they so similar?

267
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Because they evolved

268
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for the same reason:

269
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to survive predation.

270
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They work in the same way.

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus

272
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the plants [continue] to work.

273
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it is [continuing] to work.

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So, a suggestion

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for the people working with networks:

277
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
plants are able

278
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to give you good suggestions

279
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
about how to evolve networks.

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And another possibility

281
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
is a technological possibility.

282
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Let's imagine

283
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that we can build robots

284
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and robots that are inspired by plants.

285
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Until now,

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the man was inspired

287
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
just by man or the animals

288
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in producing a robot.

289
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We have the animaloid --

290
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and the normal robots inspired by animals,

291
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
insectoid, so on.

292
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We have the androids

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that are inspired by man.

294
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But why have we not any plantoid?

295
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, if you want to fly,

296
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
it's good that you look at birds --

297
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to be inspired by birds.

298
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But if you want to explore soils,

299
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
or if you want to colonize

300
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
new territory,

301
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants

302
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that are masters in doing this.

303
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We have another possibility

304
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
we are working [on] in our lab,

305
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
[which] is to build hybrids.

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's much more easy to build hybrids.

307
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Hybrid means it's something

308
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that's half living and half machine.

309
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's much more easy to work with plants

310
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
than with animals.

311
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
They have computing power,

312
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
they have electrical signals.

313
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The connection with the machine is much more easy,

314
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
much more even ethically possible.

315
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And these are three possibilities

316
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that we are working on

317
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to build hybrids,

318
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
driven by algae

319
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
or by the leaves at the end,

320
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
by the most, most powerful parts of the plants,

321
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
by the roots.

322
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Well, thank you for your attention.

323
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And before I finish,

324
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed

325
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in making this presentation.

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you.

327
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

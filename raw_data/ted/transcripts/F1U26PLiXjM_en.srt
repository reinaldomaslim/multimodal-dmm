1
0:00:12.325,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In the middle of my Ph.D.,

2
0:00:14.388,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was hopelessly stuck.

3
0:00:17.85,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Every research direction that I tried

4
0:00:19.63,000 --> 0:00:2,000
led to a dead end.

5
0:00:21.246,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It seemed like my basic assumptions

6
0:00:23.148,000 --> 0:00:24,000
just stopped working.

7
0:00:25.076,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,

8
0:00:28.075,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I lost all sense of direction.

9
0:00:30.87,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I stopped shaving.

10
0:00:32.351,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.

11
0:00:35.092,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I felt unworthy

12
0:00:36.825,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of stepping across the gates of the university,

13
0:00:39.978,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton

14
0:00:42.126,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or any other scientist whose results

15
0:00:44.279,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I had learned about, because in science,

16
0:00:45.81,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we just learn about the results, not the process.

17
0:00:49.192,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.

18
0:00:53.893,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But I had enough support

19
0:00:55.557,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I made it through

20
0:00:56.954,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and discovered something new about nature.

21
0:00:59.174,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This is an amazing feeling of calmness,

22
0:01:01.917,000 --> 0:01:02,000
being the only person in the world

23
0:01:03.249,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who knows a new law of nature.

24
0:01:05.474,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I started the second project in my Ph.D,

25
0:01:08.516,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and it happened again.

26
0:01:09.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I got stuck and I made it through.

27
0:01:12.169,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I started thinking,

28
0:01:13.555,000 --> 0:01:14,000
maybe there's a pattern here.

29
0:01:14.712,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I asked the other graduate students, and they said,

30
0:01:16.553,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,

31
0:01:18.596,000 --> 0:01:2,000
except nobody told us about it."

32
0:01:20.945,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We'd all studied science as if it's a series

33
0:01:22.895,000 --> 0:01:25,000
of logical steps between question and answer,

34
0:01:26.471,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but doing research is nothing like that.

35
0:01:29.217,000 --> 0:01:31,000
At the same time, I was also studying

36
0:01:31.551,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to be an improvisation theater actor.

37
0:01:33.638,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So physics by day,

38
0:01:35.072,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and by night, laughing, jumping, singing,

39
0:01:37.09,000 --> 0:01:38,000
playing my guitar.

40
0:01:38.402,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Improvisation theater,

41
0:01:39.881,000 --> 0:01:42,000
just like science, goes into the unknown,

42
0:01:42.89,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because you have to make a scene onstage

43
0:01:44.302,000 --> 0:01:45,000
without a director, without a script,

44
0:01:46.005,000 --> 0:01:48,000
without having any idea what you'll portray

45
0:01:48.283,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or what the other characters will do.

46
0:01:50.689,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But unlike science,

47
0:01:52.538,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in improvisation theater, they tell you from day one

48
0:01:55.561,000 --> 0:01:57,000
what's going to happen to you when you get onstage.

49
0:01:57.776,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You're going to fail miserably.

50
0:02:00.548,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You're going to get stuck.

51
0:02:01.725,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And we would practice staying creative

52
0:02:03.843,000 --> 0:02:04,000
inside that stuck place.

53
0:02:05.046,000 --> 0:02:06,000
For example, we had an exercise

54
0:02:06.951,000 --> 0:02:07,000
where we all stood in a circle,

55
0:02:08.093,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and each person had to do the world's worst tap dance,

56
0:02:11.058,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and everybody else applauded

57
0:02:12.644,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and cheered you on,

58
0:02:13.886,000 --> 0:02:15,000
supporting you onstage.

59
0:02:16.649,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When I became a professor

60
0:02:18.557,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and had to guide my own students

61
0:02:19.938,000 --> 0:02:2,000
through their research projects,

62
0:02:21.911,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I realized again,

63
0:02:23.278,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I don't know what to do.

64
0:02:24.99,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'd studied thousands of hours of physics,

65
0:02:26.984,000 --> 0:02:27,000
biology, chemistry,

66
0:02:28.598,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but not one hour, not one concept

67
0:02:30.97,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on how to mentor, how to guide someone

68
0:02:33.556,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to go together into the unknown,

69
0:02:35.293,000 --> 0:02:36,000
about motivation.

70
0:02:37.214,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I turned to improvisation theater,

71
0:02:39.144,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I told my students from day one

72
0:02:41.317,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what's going to happen when you start research,

73
0:02:44.218,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and this has to do with our mental schema

74
0:02:45.944,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of what research will be like.

75
0:02:47.956,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because you see, whenever people do anything,

76
0:02:50.234,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for example if I want to touch this blackboard,

77
0:02:52.876,000 --> 0:02:53,000
my brain first builds up a schema,

78
0:02:54.536,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do

79
0:02:56.395,000 --> 0:02:58,000
before I even start moving my hand,

80
0:02:58.551,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and if I get blocked,

81
0:03:00.399,000 --> 0:03:01,000
if my schema doesn't match reality,

82
0:03:02.274,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.

83
0:03:04.558,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's why your schemas had better match reality.

84
0:03:07.467,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But if you believe the way science is taught,

85
0:03:10.622,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and if you believe textbooks, you're liable

86
0:03:12.519,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to have the following schema of research.

87
0:03:18.813,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If A is the question,

88
0:03:22.131,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and B is the answer,

89
0:03:25.531,000 --> 0:03:29,000
then research is a direct path.

90
0:03:30.127,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,

91
0:03:33.242,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or a student gets depressed,

92
0:03:36.904,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it's perceived as something utterly wrong

93
0:03:38.99,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and causes tremendous stress.

94
0:03:42.02,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that's why I teach my students

95
0:03:43.803,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a more realistic schema.

96
0:03:50.86,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Here's an example

97
0:03:52.384,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where things don't match your schema.

98
0:03:58.379,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:01.641,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:13.564,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So I teach my students a different schema.

101
0:04:17.01,000 --> 0:04:19,000
If A is the question,

102
0:04:19.204,000 --> 0:04:21,000
B is the answer,

103
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
stay creative in the cloud,

104
0:04:26.855,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and you start going,

105
0:04:28.83,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

106
0:04:31.193,000 --> 0:04:33,000
experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

107
0:04:33.728,000 --> 0:04:35,000
until you reach a place linked with negative emotions

108
0:04:36.404,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where it seems like your basic assumptions

109
0:04:38.682,000 --> 0:04:39,000
have stopped making sense,

110
0:04:39.798,000 --> 0:04:42,000
like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.

111
0:04:42.853,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I call this place the cloud.

112
0:04:59.685,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now you can be lost in the cloud

113
0:05:02.363,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for a day, a week, a month, a year,

114
0:05:04.871,000 --> 0:05:05,000
a whole career,

115
0:05:06.369,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but sometimes, if you're lucky enough

116
0:05:08.531,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and you have enough support,

117
0:05:10.387,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you can see in the materials at hand,

118
0:05:12.377,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,

119
0:05:15.625,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a new answer,

120
0:05:19.285,000 --> 0:05:22,000
C, and you decide to go for it.

121
0:05:22.969,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

122
0:05:25.338,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but you get there,

123
0:05:26.807,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then you tell everyone about it

124
0:05:28.027,000 --> 0:05:31,000
by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,

125
0:05:31.529,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which is a great way to communicate,

126
0:05:33.488,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but as long as you don't forget the path

127
0:05:35.832,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that brought you there.

128
0:05:37.631,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now this cloud is an inherent part

129
0:05:39.606,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of research, an inherent part of our craft,

130
0:05:42.21,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because the cloud stands guard at the boundary.

131
0:05:49.721,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It stands guard at the boundary

132
0:05:51.99,000 --> 0:05:53,000
between the known

133
0:05:57.795,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the unknown,

134
0:06:05.11,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because in order to discover something truly new,

135
0:06:07.385,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at least one of your basic assumptions has to change,

136
0:06:10.962,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and that means that in science,

137
0:06:12.216,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we do something quite heroic.

138
0:06:14.178,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Every day, we try to bring ourselves

139
0:06:15.999,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to the boundary between the known and the unknown

140
0:06:17.811,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and face the cloud.

141
0:06:19.632,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now notice that I put B

142
0:06:21.337,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in the land of the known,

143
0:06:22.08,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because we knew about it in the beginning,

144
0:06:23.891,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but C is always more interesting

145
0:06:27.54,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and more important than B.

146
0:06:30.263,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So B is essential in order to get going,

147
0:06:32.456,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but C is much more profound,

148
0:06:34.274,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and that's the amazing thing about resesarch.

149
0:06:38.771,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now just knowing that word, the cloud,

150
0:06:40.959,000 --> 0:06:42,000
has been transformational in my research group,

151
0:06:43.514,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because students come to me and say,

152
0:06:45.384,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Uri, I'm in the cloud,"

153
0:06:46.982,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable."

154
0:06:50.148,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:52.29,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But I'm kind of happy,

156
0:06:54.203,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because we might be close to the boundary

157
0:06:55.881,000 --> 0:06:56,000
between the known and the unknown,

158
0:06:57.777,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we stand a chance of discovering

159
0:06:59.323,000 --> 0:07:,000
something truly new,

160
0:07:01.184,000 --> 0:07:02,000
since the way our mind works,

161
0:07:02.526,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it's just knowing that the cloud

162
0:07:05.674,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is normal, it's essential,

163
0:07:10.1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and in fact beautiful,

164
0:07:11.305,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,

165
0:07:14.928,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and it detoxifies the feeling that something

166
0:07:16.846,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is deeply wrong with me.

167
0:07:19.408,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And as a mentor, I know what to do,

168
0:07:21.858,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which is to step up my support for the student,

169
0:07:24.06,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because research in psychology shows

170
0:07:25.541,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that if you're feeling fear and despair,

171
0:07:29.1,000 --> 0:07:29,000
your mind narrows down

172
0:07:30.097,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to very safe and conservative ways of thinking.

173
0:07:32.928,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If you'd like to explore the risky paths

174
0:07:34.503,000 --> 0:07:35,000
needed to get out of the cloud,

175
0:07:35.891,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you need other emotions --

176
0:07:37.652,000 --> 0:07:39,000
solidarity, support, hope —

177
0:07:39.853,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that come with your connection from somebody else,

178
0:07:41.59,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so like in improvisation theater,

179
0:07:43.14,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in science, it's best to walk into the unknown

180
0:07:45.441,000 --> 0:07:46,000
together.

181
0:07:47.41,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So knowing about the cloud,

182
0:07:49.852,000 --> 0:07:52,000
you also learn from improvisation theater

183
0:07:53.176,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a very effective way to have conversations

184
0:07:55.778,000 --> 0:07:56,000
inside the cloud.

185
0:07:57.538,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's based on the central principle

186
0:07:59.515,000 --> 0:08:,000
of improvisation theater,

187
0:08:01.282,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so here improvisation theater

188
0:08:02.375,000 --> 0:08:03,000
came to my help again.

189
0:08:03.671,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's called saying "Yes, and"

190
0:08:05.962,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to the offers made by other actors.

191
0:08:16.297,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That means accepting the offers

192
0:08:19.191,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and building on them, saying, "Yes, and."

193
0:08:21.702,000 --> 0:08:22,000
For example, if one actor says,

194
0:08:22.941,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"Here is a pool of water,"

195
0:08:24.096,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the other actor says,

196
0:08:25.141,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"No, that's just a stage,"

197
0:08:27.01,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the improvisation is over.

198
0:08:28.748,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.

199
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:33,000
That's called blocking.

200
0:08:33.868,000 --> 0:08:34,000
If you're not mindful of communications,

201
0:08:35.475,000 --> 0:08:37,000
scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.

202
0:08:38.412,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Saying "Yes, and" sounds like this.

203
0:08:40.648,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Here is a pool of water." "Yeah, let's jump in."

204
0:08:43.156,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.

205
0:08:46.165,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's pulling us to the moon!"

206
0:08:48.266,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.

207
0:08:51.286,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We all have an inner critic

208
0:08:52.98,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that kind of guards what we say,

209
0:08:54.221,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so people don't think that we're obscene

210
0:08:56.144,000 --> 0:08:57,000
or crazy or unoriginal,

211
0:08:57.259,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and science is full of the fear

212
0:08:58.519,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of appearing unoriginal.

213
0:09:00.076,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Saying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic

214
0:09:02.243,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and unlocks hidden voices of creativity

215
0:09:04.855,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you didn't even know that you had,

216
0:09:06.38,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and they often carry the answer

217
0:09:08.41,000 --> 0:09:1,000
about the cloud.

218
0:09:10.815,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So you see, knowing about the cloud

219
0:09:13.416,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and about saying "Yes, and"

220
0:09:14.82,000 --> 0:09:16,000
made my lab very creative.

221
0:09:17.679,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Students started playing off of each others' ideas,

222
0:09:20.207,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and we made surprising discoveries

223
0:09:22.321,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in the interface between physics and biology.

224
0:09:25.19,000 --> 0:09:27,000
For example, we were stuck for a year

225
0:09:28.14,000 --> 0:09:29,000
trying to understand the intricate

226
0:09:29.289,000 --> 0:09:31,000
biochemical networks inside our cells,

227
0:09:31.982,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,"

228
0:09:34.439,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and we had a playful conversation

229
0:09:36.419,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where my student Shai Shen Orr said,

230
0:09:38.207,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Let's just draw this on a piece of paper, this network,"

231
0:09:41.05,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and instead of saying,

232
0:09:42.503,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"But we've done that so many times

233
0:09:44.654,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it doesn't work,"

234
0:09:45.688,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I said, "Yes, and

235
0:09:48.631,000 --> 0:09:5,000
let's use a very big piece of paper,"

236
0:09:50.672,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and then Ron Milo said,

237
0:09:51.764,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"Let's use a gigantic architect's

238
0:09:53.984,000 --> 0:09:54,000
blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"

239
0:09:55.78,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and we printed out the network and looked at it,

240
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:10:,000
and that's where we made our most important discovery,

241
0:10:00.789,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that this complicated network is just made

242
0:10:02.99,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns

243
0:10:06.453,000 --> 0:10:09,000
like motifs in a stained glass window.

244
0:10:09.616,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We call them network motifs,

245
0:10:11.664,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and they're the elementary circuits

246
0:10:13.816,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that help us understand

247
0:10:15.201,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the logic of the way cells make decisions

248
0:10:17.901,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in all organisms, including our body.

249
0:10:20.75,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Soon enough, after this,

250
0:10:22.675,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I started being invited to give talks

251
0:10:24.295,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to thousands of scientists across the world,

252
0:10:27.306,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but the knowledge about the cloud

253
0:10:29.139,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and saying "Yes, and"

254
0:10:30.271,000 --> 0:10:31,000
just stayed within my own lab,

255
0:10:32.11,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because you see, in science, we don't talk about the process,

256
0:10:34.241,000 --> 0:10:36,000
anything subjective or emotional.

257
0:10:36.674,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We talk about the results.

258
0:10:38.537,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So there was no way to talk about it in conferences.

259
0:10:40.606,000 --> 0:10:41,000
That was unthinkable.

260
0:10:42.53,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck

261
0:10:44.606,000 --> 0:10:45,000
without even having a word to describe

262
0:10:46.38,000 --> 0:10:47,000
what they're seeing,

263
0:10:47.701,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and their ways of thinking

264
0:10:49.056,000 --> 0:10:5,000
narrowed down to very safe paths,

265
0:10:50.584,000 --> 0:10:51,000
their science didn't reach its full potential,

266
0:10:52.244,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and they were miserable.

267
0:10:53.997,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I thought, that's the way it is.

268
0:10:55.936,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,

269
0:10:57.957,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and if everybody else does the same,

270
0:10:59.637,000 --> 0:11:01,000
science will eventually become

271
0:11:01.827,000 --> 0:11:03,000
more and more better and better.

272
0:11:04.041,000 --> 0:11:06,000
That way of thinking got turned on its head

273
0:11:06.961,000 --> 0:11:08,000
when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller

274
0:11:09.3,000 --> 0:11:1,000
give a talk about her experiences

275
0:11:10.658,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as a woman in science.

276
0:11:12.349,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And she asked,

277
0:11:14.172,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective

278
0:11:16.12,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and emotional aspects of doing science?

279
0:11:18.306,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's not by chance. It's a matter of values."

280
0:11:22.298,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You see, science seeks knowledge

281
0:11:24.476,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that's objective and rational.

282
0:11:26.271,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That's the beautiful thing about science.

283
0:11:28.469,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But we also have a cultural myth

284
0:11:30.425,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that the doing of science,

285
0:11:31.679,000 --> 0:11:33,000
what we do every day to get that knowledge,

286
0:11:33.979,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is also only objective and rational,

287
0:11:36.419,000 --> 0:11:38,000
like Mr. Spock.

288
0:11:38.851,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And when you label something

289
0:11:40.265,000 --> 0:11:41,000
as objective and rational,

290
0:11:42.078,000 --> 0:11:43,000
automatically, the other side,

291
0:11:43.72,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the subjective and emotional,

292
0:11:45.177,000 --> 0:11:47,000
become labeled as non-science

293
0:11:47.279,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or anti-science or threatening to science,

294
0:11:49.25,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and we just don't talk about it.

295
0:11:51.061,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And when I heard that,

296
0:11:53.015,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that science has a culture,

297
0:11:55.182,000 --> 0:11:56,000
everything clicked into place for me,

298
0:11:56.729,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because if science has a culture,

299
0:11:58.393,000 --> 0:11:59,000
culture can be changed,

300
0:11:59.649,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I can be a change agent

301
0:12:01.242,000 --> 0:12:03,000
working to change the culture of science wherever I could.

302
0:12:03.954,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,

303
0:12:07.023,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I talked about my science,

304
0:12:08.635,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and then I talked about the importance

305
0:12:10.147,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science

306
0:12:12.329,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and how we should talk about them,

307
0:12:13.449,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and I looked at the audience,

308
0:12:14.683,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and they were cold.

309
0:12:17.043,000 --> 0:12:2,000
They couldn't hear what I was saying

310
0:12:20.334,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in the context of a 10 back-to-back

311
0:12:21.585,000 --> 0:12:22,000
PowerPoint presentation conference.

312
0:12:23.424,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I tried again and again, conference after conference,

313
0:12:25.906,000 --> 0:12:27,000
but I wasn't getting through.

314
0:12:28.279,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I was in the cloud.

315
0:12:31.185,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And eventually I managed to get out the cloud

316
0:12:34.699,000 --> 0:12:36,000
using improvisation and music.

317
0:12:37.51,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Since then, every conference I go to,

318
0:12:40.249,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I give a science talk and a second, special talk

319
0:12:43.111,000 --> 0:12:44,000
called "Love and fear in the lab,"

320
0:12:45.104,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and I start it off by doing a song

321
0:12:47.321,000 --> 0:12:49,000
about scientists' greatest fear,

322
0:12:49.893,000 --> 0:12:51,000
which is that we work hard,

323
0:12:52.805,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we discover something new,

324
0:12:55.147,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and somebody else publishes it before we do.

325
0:12:58.504,000 --> 0:13:,000
We call it being scooped,

326
0:13:01.12,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and being scooped feels horrible.

327
0:13:04.334,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It makes us afraid to talk to each other,

328
0:13:06.547,000 --> 0:13:06,000
which is no fun,

329
0:13:07.38,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because we came to science to share our ideas

330
0:13:10.14,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and to learn from each other,

331
0:13:11.451,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and so I do a blues song,

332
0:13:17.04,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which — (Applause) —

333
0:13:22.544,000 --> 0:13:25,000
called "Scooped Again,"

334
0:13:25.767,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and I ask the audience to be my backup singers,

335
0:13:28.425,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"

336
0:13:32.405,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!"

337
0:13:35.05,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Sounds like this.

338
0:13:36.013,000 --> 0:13:38,000

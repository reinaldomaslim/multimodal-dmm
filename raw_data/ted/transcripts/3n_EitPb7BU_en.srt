0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Four years ago, on the TED stage,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I announced a company I was working with at the time

3
0:00:23.728,000 --> 0:00:24,000
called Odeo.

4
0:00:25.637,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And because of that announcement,

5
0:00:27.314,000 --> 0:00:29,000
we got a big article in The New York Times,

6
0:00:29.376,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which led to more press, which led to more attention,

7
0:00:32.653,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and me deciding to become CEO of that company --

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
whereas I was just an adviser --

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and raising a round of venture capital

10
0:00:39.683,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and ramping up hiring.

11
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,

12
0:00:45.176,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,

13
0:00:49.114,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years

14
0:00:53.776,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,

16
0:00:59.576,000 --> 0:01:,000
so we kind of put two and two together,

17
0:01:01.422,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.

18
0:01:06.375,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project

19
0:01:08.853,000 --> 0:01:1,000
at a startup, where focus is so critical,

20
0:01:11.206,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project

21
0:01:13.545,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to my previous company,

22
0:01:14.868,000 --> 0:01:16,000
thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and it ended up taking over not only the company,

24
0:01:19.93,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but my life for the next five or six years.

25
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I learned to follow hunches

26
0:01:24.667,000 --> 0:01:25,000
even though you can't necessarily justify them

27
0:01:26.53,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or know where they're going to go.

28
0:01:27.959,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, for those of you unfamiliar,

30
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.

31
0:01:36.791,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,

32
0:01:40.006,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and people who are interested in you get those updates.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
If they're really interested,

34
0:01:44.776,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.

35
0:01:47.914,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now

36
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that I'm giving a talk at TED.

37
0:01:52.405,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And in my case, when I hit send,

38
0:01:55.114,000 --> 0:01:59,000
up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.

39
0:01:59.38,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter

40
0:02:02.752,000 --> 0:02:04,000
lets people share moments of their lives

41
0:02:05.191,000 --> 0:02:06,000
whenever they want,

42
0:02:06.406,000 --> 0:02:08,000
be they momentous occasions

43
0:02:08.714,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or mundane ones.

44
0:02:12.252,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening

45
0:02:15.082,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that lets people feel more connected and in touch,

46
0:02:18.856,000 --> 0:02:2,000
despite distance, and in real time.

47
0:02:21.036,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,

48
0:02:24.008,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and what got us excited.

49
0:02:26.367,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses

50
0:02:29.852,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that would evolve from this very simple system.

51
0:02:32.933,000 --> 0:02:33,000
One of the things we realized

52
0:02:34.93,000 --> 0:02:37,000
was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.

53
0:02:38.212,000 --> 0:02:41,000
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,

54
0:02:41.509,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in October of 2007,

55
0:02:43.42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
people turned to Twitter to report what was happening

56
0:02:45.625,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and to find information from neighbors

57
0:02:47.659,000 --> 0:02:48,000
about what was happening around them.

58
0:02:49.431,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But it wasn't just individuals.

59
0:02:50.736,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,

60
0:02:54.319,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and put a Twitter feed on the front page,

61
0:02:56.336,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross

62
0:02:58.424,000 --> 0:03:01,000
used it to dispense news and updates as well.

63
0:03:01.52,000 --> 0:03:04,000
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering

64
0:03:04.583,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and thousands of people around the world are following along

65
0:03:07.246,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because they want to know what it feels like to be here

66
0:03:09.228,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and what's happening.

67
0:03:10.804,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Among the other interesting things that have cropped up

68
0:03:13.884,000 --> 0:03:15,000
are many things from businesses,

69
0:03:15.933,000 --> 0:03:17,000
from marketing and communications and predictable things,

70
0:03:18.575,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck

71
0:03:21.812,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,

72
0:03:24.068,000 --> 0:03:29,000
causing a line to form around the block.

73
0:03:29.084,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.

74
0:03:32.13,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In fact, there are 47 members of Congress

75
0:03:34.22,000 --> 0:03:35,000
who currently have Twitter accounts.

76
0:03:35.971,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And they're tweeting, in some cases,

77
0:03:38.401,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from behind closed-door sessions with the President.

78
0:03:40.875,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.

79
0:03:43.473,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,

80
0:03:46.996,000 --> 0:03:49,000
although his tweets have dropped off as of late,

81
0:03:50.883,000 --> 0:03:54,000
while Senator McCain's have picked up.

82
0:03:55.674,000 --> 0:03:58,000
As have this guy's.

83
0:03:58.858,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:

84
0:04:02.723,000 --> 0:04:04,000
you send one message and it goes out to everybody,

85
0:04:04.755,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and you receive the messages you're interested in.

86
0:04:06.811,000 --> 0:04:1,000
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter

87
0:04:11.131,000 --> 0:04:14,000
was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person

88
0:04:14.812,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or a specific message.

89
0:04:17.118,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here

90
0:04:20.287,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to reply to one of his fans,

91
0:04:21.991,000 --> 0:04:22,000
was completely invented by users,

92
0:04:23.831,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular

93
0:04:26.864,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and then we made it easier.

94
0:04:28.831,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.

95
0:04:31.662,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Another is via the API.

96
0:04:33.431,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We built an application-programming interface,

97
0:04:35.335,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.

98
0:04:39.652,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software

99
0:04:42.335,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that can send Twitter updates --

100
0:04:43.687,000 --> 0:04:47,000
interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --

101
0:04:48.175,000 --> 0:04:5,000
as well as things like

102
0:04:50.567,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks

103
0:04:52.967,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or a plant Twitter when it needs water.

104
0:04:56.07,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Probably the most important third-party development

105
0:04:58.695,000 --> 0:05:,000
came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.

106
0:05:01.455,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Summize built a Twitter search engine.

107
0:05:03.726,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And they tapped into the fact

108
0:05:05.536,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that, if you have millions of people around the world

109
0:05:07.743,000 --> 0:05:09,000
talking about what they're doing and what's around them,

110
0:05:10.151,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event

111
0:05:14.978,000 --> 0:05:15,000
while it's going on.

112
0:05:16.623,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.

113
0:05:18.963,000 --> 0:05:22,000
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.

114
0:05:23.143,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is another way that our mind was shifted,

115
0:05:26.432,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.

116
0:05:28.792,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We liked this so much we actually bought the company

117
0:05:31.209,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and are folding it into the main product.

118
0:05:33.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,

119
0:05:37.024,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but it introduces new use cases as well.

120
0:05:39.464,000 --> 0:05:41,000
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago

121
0:05:42.176,000 --> 0:05:44,000
when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.

122
0:05:44.723,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Some users figured out

123
0:05:46.463,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that they would Twitter when they found gas --

124
0:05:49.476,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where it was, and how much it cost --

125
0:05:51.752,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"

126
0:05:54.266,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.

127
0:05:57.944,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And this trend of people using this communication network

128
0:06:00.273,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to help each other out

129
0:06:01.649,000 --> 0:06:04,000
goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.

130
0:06:05.492,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's happened more and more lately,

131
0:06:08.659,000 --> 0:06:1,000
whether it's raising money for homeless people

132
0:06:11.145,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or to dig wells in Africa

133
0:06:12.881,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or for a family in crisis.

134
0:06:15.145,000 --> 0:06:17,000
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter

135
0:06:17.969,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in a matter of days on several occasions.

136
0:06:22.421,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,

137
0:06:27.498,000 --> 0:06:29,000
more good things happen.

138
0:06:30.066,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.

139
0:06:34.298,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I've learned to follow the hunch,

140
0:06:36.362,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but never assume where it will go.

141
0:06:39.506,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Thanks.

142
0:06:41.69,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Applause)

143
0:06:47.575,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.

144
0:06:49.346,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So, look, if we could have this screen live.

145
0:06:51.684,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do

146
0:06:54.052,000 --> 0:06:55,000
after they've been to an event.

147
0:06:55.714,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's totally intimidating.

148
0:06:58.69,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.

149
0:07:01.81,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.

150
0:07:05.545,000 --> 0:07:1,000
For example: "Evan Williams."

151
0:07:10.945,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."

152
0:07:15.253,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"

153
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Oh.

154
0:07:19.144,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.

155
0:07:21.052,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)

156
0:07:24.19,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.

157
0:07:25.744,000 --> 0:07:27,000
CA: Just kidding.

158
0:07:28.114,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,

159
0:07:30.868,000 --> 0:07:32,000
there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.

160
0:07:33.221,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:

161
0:07:35.822,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,

162
0:07:38.082,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the fact that it came out of TED.

163
0:07:39.467,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.

164
0:07:42.421,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You have build something very fascinating,

165
0:07:44.698,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.

166
0:07:47.021,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.

167
0:07:48.729,000 --> 0:07:54,000
CA: That was very interesting.

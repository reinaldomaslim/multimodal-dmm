1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I remember the very first time I went to a nice restaurant,

2
0:00:15.719,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a really nice restaurant.

3
0:00:17.36,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,

4
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I remember beforehand the waitress walked around

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and asked whether we wanted some wine,

6
0:00:23.88,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so I said, "Sure, I'll take some white wine."

7
0:00:26.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And she immediately said,

8
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"Would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?"

9
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I remember thinking,

10
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Come on, lady, stop with the fancy French words

11
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and just give me some white wine."

12
0:00:39.4,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But I used my powers of deduction

13
0:00:41.04,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc

14
0:00:43.48,000 --> 0:00:44,000
were two separate types of white wine,

15
0:00:45.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and so I told her that I would take the chardonnay,

16
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce for me.

17
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I had a lot of experiences like that

18
0:00:54.08,000 --> 0:00:56,000
during my first couple of years as a law student at Yale,

19
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:01:,000
because, despite all outward appearances, I'm a cultural outsider.

20
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I didn't come from the elites.

21
0:01:02.84,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I didn't come from the Northeast or from San Francisco.

22
0:01:07.2,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I came from a southern Ohio steel town,

23
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it's a town that's really struggling in a lot of ways,

24
0:01:12.08,000 --> 0:01:14,000
ways that are indicative of the broader struggles

25
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of America's working class.

26
0:01:16.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Heroin has moved in,

27
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:2,000
killing a lot of people, people I know.

28
0:01:20.68,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Family violence, domestic violence, and divorce have torn apart families.

29
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And there's a very unique sense of pessimism that's moved in.

30
0:01:29.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Think about rising mortality rates in these communities

31
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and recognize that for a lot of these folks,

32
0:01:34.44,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the problems that they're seeing

33
0:01:36.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
are actually causing rising death rates in their own communities,

34
0:01:39.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so there's a very real sense of struggle.

35
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I had a very front-row seat to that struggle.

36
0:01:45.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My family has been part of that struggle for a very long time.

37
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I come from a family that doesn't have a whole lot of money.

38
0:01:55.44,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The addiction that plagued my community

39
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:02:,000
also plagued my family, and even, sadly, my own mom.

40
0:02:01.76,000 --> 0:02:05,000
There were a lot of problems that I saw in my own family,

41
0:02:05.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
problems caused sometimes by a lack of money,

42
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
problems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital

43
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that really affected my life.

44
0:02:16.4,000 --> 0:02:18,000
If you had looked at my life when I was 14 years old

45
0:02:19.2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and said, "Well, what's going to happen to this kid?"

46
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you would have concluded that I would have struggled

47
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with what academics call upward mobility.

48
0:02:28.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So upward mobility is an abstract term,

49
0:02:31.56,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but it strikes at something that's very core

50
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
at the heart of the American Dream.

51
0:02:36.04,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's the sense,

52
0:02:37.28,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and it measures whether kids like me

53
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
who grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life,

54
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:47,000
whether they're going to have a chance to live a materially better existence,

55
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or whether they're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from.

56
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And one of the things we've learned, unfortunately,

57
0:02:53.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is that upward mobility isn't as high as we'd like it to be in this country,

58
0:02:57.48,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and interestingly, it's very geographically distributed.

59
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So take Utah, for instance.

60
0:03:04.84,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,

61
0:03:08.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
very likely to live their share and their part in the American Dream.

62
0:03:12.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But if you think of where I'm from,

63
0:03:14.44,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the South, in Appalachia, in southern Ohio,

64
0:03:18.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's very unlikely that kids like that will rise.

65
0:03:22.64,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The American Dream in those parts of the country

66
0:03:24.92,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is in a very real sense just a dream.

67
0:03:27.96,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So why is that happening?

68
0:03:30.12,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So one reason is obviously economic or structural.

69
0:03:32.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So you think of these areas.

70
0:03:34.52,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They're beset by these terrible economic trends,

71
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
built around industries like coal and steel

72
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that make it harder for folks to get ahead.

73
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That's certainly one problem.

74
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There's also the problem of brain drain, where the really talented people,

75
0:03:47.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because they can't find high-skilled work at home,

76
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
end up moving elsewhere,

77
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so they don't build a business or non-profit where they're from,

78
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they end up going elsewhere and taking their talents with them.

79
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
There are failing schools in a lot of these communities,

80
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:01,000
failing to give kids the educational leg up

81
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life.

82
0:04:05.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
These things are all important.

83
0:04:07.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I don't mean to discount these structural barriers.

84
0:04:09.48,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But when I look back at my life and my community,

85
0:04:11.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
something else was going on, something else mattered.

86
0:04:15.84,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's difficult to quantify, but it was no less real.

87
0:04:20.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So for starters, there was a very real sense of hopelessness

88
0:04:23.8,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in the community that I grew up in.

89
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
There was a sense that kids had that their choices didn't matter.

90
0:04:28.76,000 --> 0:04:3,000
No matter what happened, no matter how hard they worked,

91
0:04:31.44,000 --> 0:04:33,000
no matter how hard they tried to get ahead,

92
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
nothing good would happen.

93
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So that's a tough feeling to grow up around.

94
0:04:39.24,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's a tough mindset to penetrate,

95
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and it leads sometimes to very conspiratorial places.

96
0:04:47.24,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So let's just take one political issue that's pretty hot,

97
0:04:51.2,000 --> 0:04:52,000
affirmative action.

98
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So depending on your politics, you might think that affirmative action

99
0:04:56.04,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace

100
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
or the classroom.

101
0:05:00.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But if you grow up in an area like this,

102
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back.

103
0:05:06.56,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That's especially true if you're a member of the white working class.

104
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You see it as something that isn't just about good or bad policy.

105
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You see it as something that's actively conspiring,

106
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
where people with political and financial power

107
0:05:18.28,000 --> 0:05:19,000
are working against you.

108
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And there are a lot of ways that you see that conspiracy against you --

109
0:05:25.52,000 --> 0:05:27,000
perceived, real, but it's there,

110
0:05:28.44,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and it warps expectations.

111
0:05:31.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So if you think about what do you do when you grow up in that world,

112
0:05:34.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
you can respond in a couple of ways.

113
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
One, you can say, "I'm not going to work hard,

114
0:05:38.24,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because no matter how hard I work, it's not going to matter."

115
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Another thing you might do is say,

116
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"Well, I'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success,

117
0:05:46.08,000 --> 0:05:48,000
like a university education or a prestigious job,

118
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because the people who care about those things are unlike me.

119
0:05:51.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They're never going to let me in."

120
0:05:53.004,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When I got admitted to Yale, a family member asked me

121
0:05:55.505,000 --> 0:05:58,000
if I had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee.

122
0:05:58.84,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Seriously.

123
0:06:00.64,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And it's obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check

124
0:06:04.68,000 --> 0:06:05,000
on the application,

125
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places

126
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that you have to pretend to be somebody you're not

127
0:06:12.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to get past these various social barriers.

128
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's a very significant problem.

129
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Even if you don't give in to that hopelessness,

130
0:06:20.08,000 --> 0:06:21,000
even if you think, let's say,

131
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that your choices matter and you want to make the good choices,

132
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
you want to do better for yourself and for your family,

133
0:06:28.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it's sometimes hard to even know what those choices are

134
0:06:31.68,000 --> 0:06:33,000
when you grow up in a community like I did.

135
0:06:33.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I didn't know, for example,

136
0:06:35.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that you had to go to law school to be a lawyer.

137
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I didn't know that elite universities, as research consistently tells us,

138
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
are cheaper for low-income kids

139
0:06:44.12,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because these universities have bigger endowments,

140
0:06:46.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
can offer more generous financial aid.

141
0:06:48.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I remember I learned this

142
0:06:50.2,000 --> 0:06:52,000
when I got the financial aid letter from Yale for myself,

143
0:06:53.04,000 --> 0:06:55,000
tens of thousands of dollars in need-based aid,

144
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:06:57,000
which is a term I had never heard before.

145
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But I turned to my aunt when I got that letter and said,

146
0:07:00.6,000 --> 0:07:03,000
"You know, I think this just means that for the first time in my life,

147
0:07:03.92,000 --> 0:07:04,000
being poor has paid really well."

148
0:07:07.36,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So I didn't have access to that information

149
0:07:10.2,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because the social networks around me didn't have access to that information.

150
0:07:13.88,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I learned from my community how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.

151
0:07:17.56,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe.

152
0:07:20.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The trick, by the way, is frozen butter, not warm butter.

153
0:07:24.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But I didn't learn how to get ahead.

154
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I didn't learn how to make the good decisions

155
0:07:28.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
about education and opportunity

156
0:07:30.48,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that you need to make

157
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to actually have a chance in this 21st century knowledge economy.

158
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks,

159
0:07:40.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
from our friends and colleagues and family "social capital."

160
0:07:44.2,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The social capital that I had wasn't built for 21st century America,

161
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and it showed.

162
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There's something else that's really important that's going on

163
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that our community doesn't like to talk about,

164
0:07:55.52,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but it's very real.

165
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Working-class kids are much more likely

166
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to face what's called adverse childhood experiences,

167
0:08:01.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which is just a fancy word for childhood trauma:

168
0:08:06.28,000 --> 0:08:09,000
getting hit or yelled at, put down by a parent repeatedly,

169
0:08:09.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
watching someone hit or beat your parent,

170
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:15,000
watching someone do drugs or abuse alcohol.

171
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
These are all instances of childhood trauma,

172
0:08:18.28,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and they're pretty commonplace in my family.

173
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Importantly, they're not just commonplace in my family right now.

174
0:08:24.4,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They're also multigenerational.

175
0:08:26.44,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So my grandparents,

176
0:08:28.64,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the very first time that they had kids,

177
0:08:31.44,000 --> 0:08:33,000
they expected that they were going to raise them in a way

178
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that was uniquely good.

179
0:08:35.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They were middle class,

180
0:08:37.08,000 --> 0:08:39,000
they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill.

181
0:08:39.485,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But what ended up happening

182
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma

183
0:08:43.88,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that had gone back many generations.

184
0:08:46.6,000 --> 0:08:5,000
My mom was 12 when she saw my grandma set my grandfather on fire.

185
0:08:52.12,000 --> 0:08:54,000
His crime was that he came home drunk

186
0:08:54.96,000 --> 0:08:55,000
after she told him,

187
0:08:56.2,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"If you come home drunk, I'm gonna kill you."

188
0:08:59.24,000 --> 0:09:,000
And she tried to do it.

189
0:09:01.44,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Think about the way that that affects a child's mind.

190
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we think of these things as especially rare,

191
0:09:08.48,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but a study by the Wisconsin Children's Trust Fund found

192
0:09:12.48,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that 40 percent of low-income kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma,

193
0:09:18.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
compared to only 29 percent for upper-income kids.

194
0:09:22.12,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And think about what that really means.

195
0:09:24.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
If you're a low-income kid,

196
0:09:26.56,000 --> 0:09:3,000
almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma.

197
0:09:31.04,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is not an isolated problem.

198
0:09:32.88,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is a very significant issue.

199
0:09:35.8,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We know what happens to the kids who experience that life.

200
0:09:39.92,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They're more likely to do drugs, more likely to go to jail,

201
0:09:43.24,000 --> 0:09:45,000
more likely to drop out of high school,

202
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and most importantly,

203
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they're more likely to do to their children

204
0:09:49.24,000 --> 0:09:5,000
what their parents did to them.

205
0:09:51.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This trauma, this chaos in the home,

206
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is our culture's very worst gift to our children,

207
0:09:58.24,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it's a gift that keeps on giving.

208
0:10:02.28,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So you combine all that,

209
0:10:04.12,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the hopelessness, the despair,

210
0:10:06.84,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the cynicism about the future,

211
0:10:09.2,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the childhood trauma,

212
0:10:11.44,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the low social capital,

213
0:10:13.36,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and you begin to understand why me,

214
0:10:15.68,000 --> 0:10:16,000
at the age of 14,

215
0:10:17.28,000 --> 0:10:19,000
was ready to become just another statistic,

216
0:10:19.64,000 --> 0:10:21,000
another kid who failed to beat the odds.

217
0:10:22.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But something unexpected happened.

218
0:10:25.36,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I did beat the odds.

219
0:10:27.12,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Things turned up for me.

220
0:10:29.28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I graduated from high school, from college, I went to law school,

221
0:10:33.04,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I have a pretty good job now.

222
0:10:35.32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So what happened?

223
0:10:37.32,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Well, one thing that happened is that my grandparents,

224
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame,

225
0:10:42.44,000 --> 0:10:44,000
they really shaped up by the time I came around.

226
0:10:45.32,000 --> 0:10:48,000
They provided me a stable home,

227
0:10:48.4,000 --> 0:10:49,000
a stable family.

228
0:10:49.72,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They made sure

229
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that when my parents weren't able to do the things that kids need,

230
0:10:54.12,000 --> 0:10:55,000
they stepped in and filled that role.

231
0:10:56.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
My grandma especially did two things that really matter.

232
0:10:59.56,000 --> 0:11:02,000
One, she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework

233
0:11:03.08,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the things that kids should be focused on.

234
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But she was also this incredibly perceptive woman,

235
0:11:08.12,000 --> 0:11:1,000
despite not even having a middle school education.

236
0:11:10.52,000 --> 0:11:12,000
She recognized the message that my community had for me,

237
0:11:13.2,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that my choices didn't matter,

238
0:11:15.28,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that the deck was stacked against me.

239
0:11:17.12,000 --> 0:11:18,000
She once told me,

240
0:11:18.36,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"JD, never be like those losers who think the deck is stacked against them.

241
0:11:22.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You can do anything you want to."

242
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And yet she recognized that life wasn't fair.

243
0:11:27.96,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It's hard to strike that balance,

244
0:11:29.6,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to tell a kid that life isn't fair,

245
0:11:31.64,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter.

246
0:11:36.92,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But mamaw was able to strike that balance.

247
0:11:41.04,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The other thing that really helped was the United States Marine Corps.

248
0:11:44.36,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So we think of the Marine Corps as a military outfit, and of course it is,

249
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but for me, the US Marine Corps was a four-year crash course

250
0:11:50.76,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in character education.

251
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It taught me how to make a bed, how to do laundry,

252
0:11:54.4,000 --> 0:11:56,000
how to wake up early, how to manage my finances.

253
0:11:56.68,000 --> 0:11:58,000
These are things my community didn't teach me.

254
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
I remember when I went to go buy a car for the very first time,

255
0:12:01.857,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I was offered a dealer's low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,

256
0:12:06.2,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and I was ready to sign on the dotted line.

257
0:12:09.68,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But I didn't take that deal,

258
0:12:11.56,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because I went and took it to my officer

259
0:12:13.6,000 --> 0:12:15,000
who told me, "Stop being an idiot,

260
0:12:15.76,000 --> 0:12:17,000
go to the local credit union, and get a better deal."

261
0:12:18.28,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And so that's what I did.

262
0:12:19.76,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But without the Marine Corps,

263
0:12:21.2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I would have never had access to that knowledge.

264
0:12:23.48,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I would have had a financial calamity, frankly.

265
0:12:26.72,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The last thing I want to say is that I had a lot of good fortune

266
0:12:29.88,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the mentors and people

267
0:12:31.48,000 --> 0:12:33,000
who have played an important role in my life.

268
0:12:33.64,000 --> 0:12:36,000
From the Marines, from Ohio State, from Yale,

269
0:12:36.72,000 --> 0:12:37,000
from other places,

270
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
people have really stepped in

271
0:12:39.68,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and ensured that they filled that social capital gap

272
0:12:42.52,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that it was pretty obvious, apparently, that I had.

273
0:12:45.48,000 --> 0:12:46,000
That comes from good fortune,

274
0:12:47.84,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but a lot of children aren't going to have that good fortune,

275
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and I think that raises really important questions for all of us

276
0:12:54.88,000 --> 0:12:55,000
about how we're going to change that.

277
0:12:57.6,000 --> 0:13:,000
We need to ask questions about how we're going to give low-income kids

278
0:13:01.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
who come from a broken home access to a loving home.

279
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We need to ask questions

280
0:13:06.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
about how we're going to teach low-income parents

281
0:13:08.8,000 --> 0:13:1,000
how to better interact with their children,

282
0:13:10.96,000 --> 0:13:11,000
with their partners.

283
0:13:12.48,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We need to ask questions about how we give social capital,

284
0:13:16.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
mentorship to low-income kids who don't have it.

285
0:13:20.36,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We need to think about how we teach working class children

286
0:13:23.44,000 --> 0:13:25,000
about not just hard skills,

287
0:13:25.96,000 --> 0:13:27,000
like reading, mathematics,

288
0:13:28.08,000 --> 0:13:29,000
but also soft skills,

289
0:13:29.44,000 --> 0:13:31,000
like conflict resolution and financial management.

290
0:13:33.44,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now, I don't have all of the answers.

291
0:13:36.68,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I don't know all of the solutions to this problem,

292
0:13:40.36,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but I do know this:

293
0:13:42.6,000 --> 0:13:43,000
in southern Ohio right now,

294
0:13:44.36,000 --> 0:13:47,000
there's a kid who is anxiously awaiting their dad,

295
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
wondering whether, when he comes through the door,

296
0:13:50.56,000 --> 0:13:52,000
he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.

297
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There's a kid

298
0:13:56.56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
whose mom sticks a needle in her arm

299
0:13:58.92,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and passes out,

300
0:14:00.44,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and he doesn't know why she doesn't cook him dinner,

301
0:14:03.36,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and he goes to bed hungry that night.

302
0:14:06.4,000 --> 0:14:09,000
There's a kid who has no hope for the future

303
0:14:10.36,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but desperately wants to live a better life.

304
0:14:13.64,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They just want somebody to show it to them.

305
0:14:16.68,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I don't have all the answers,

306
0:14:18.56,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but I know that unless our society starts asking better questions

307
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
about why I was so lucky

308
0:14:25.64,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and about how to get that luck to more of our communities

309
0:14:28.72,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and our country's children,

310
0:14:30.4,000 --> 0:14:33,000
we're going to continue to have a very significant problem.

311
0:14:33.68,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Thank you.

312
0:14:34.92,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

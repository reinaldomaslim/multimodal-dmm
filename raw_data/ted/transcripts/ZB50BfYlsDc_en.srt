1
0:00:12.627,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, we used to solve big problems.

2
0:00:17.263,000 --> 0:00:2,000
On July 21st, 1969,

3
0:00:20.783,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module

4
0:00:24.37,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.

5
0:00:27.927,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,

6
0:00:30.657,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but their presence on the moon's gray surface

7
0:00:32.943,000 --> 0:00:37,000
was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.

8
0:00:38.074,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The Apollo program was the greatest

9
0:00:40.118,000 --> 0:00:41,000
peacetime mobilization

10
0:00:41.855,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the history of the United States.

11
0:00:43.793,000 --> 0:00:44,000
To get to the moon, NASA spent

12
0:00:45.289,000 --> 0:00:48,000
around 180 billion dollars in today's money,

13
0:00:49.028,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or four percent of the federal budget.

14
0:00:51.564,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Apollo employed around 400,000 people

15
0:00:54.868,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and demanded the collaboration of 20,000

16
0:00:57.706,000 --> 0:01:,000
companies, universities and government agencies.

17
0:01:01.402,000 --> 0:01:04,000
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.

18
0:01:05.346,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But before the Apollo program ended,

19
0:01:08.947,000 --> 0:01:1,000
24 men flew to the moon.

20
0:01:11.176,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,

21
0:01:14.25,000 --> 0:01:16,000
following the death of Armstrong last year,

22
0:01:16.603,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is now the most senior.

23
0:01:18.689,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So why did they go?

24
0:01:20.674,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They didn't bring much back:

25
0:01:22.591,000 --> 0:01:24,000
841 pounds of old rocks,

26
0:01:25.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and something all 24 later emphasized --

27
0:01:29.705,000 --> 0:01:31,000
a new sense of the smallness

28
0:01:32.567,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the fragility of our common home.

29
0:01:35.51,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went

30
0:01:38.59,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because President Kennedy wanted to show

31
0:01:40.566,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.

32
0:01:44.673,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962

33
0:01:49.145,000 --> 0:01:5,000
provide a better clue.

34
0:01:51.043,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?

35
0:01:53.566,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why choose this as our goal?

36
0:01:56.51,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And they may well ask,

37
0:01:58.433,000 --> 0:02:,000
why climb the highest mountain?

38
0:02:01.012,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?

39
0:02:05.028,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Why does Rice play Texas?

40
0:02:07.212,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We choose to go to the moon.

41
0:02:09.823,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We choose to go to the moon.

42
0:02:12.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:17.67,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We choose to go to the moon in this decade,

44
0:02:20.584,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and do the other things,

45
0:02:22.231,000 --> 0:02:26,000
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

46
0:02:26.56,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,

47
0:02:28.73,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East

48
0:02:31.983,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the Cold War.

49
0:02:33.198,000 --> 0:02:35,000
At the time, the strongest emotion

50
0:02:35.203,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was of wonder

51
0:02:36.928,000 --> 0:02:39,000
at the transcendent powers of technology.

52
0:02:40.527,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They went because it was a big thing to do.

53
0:02:45.946,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Landing on the moon occurred in the context

54
0:02:48.466,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of a long series of technological triumphs.

55
0:02:51.631,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The first half of the 20th century produced

56
0:02:54.144,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the assembly line and the airplane,

57
0:02:56.28,000 --> 0:02:59,000
penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.

58
0:02:59.554,000 --> 0:03:,000
In the middle years of the century,

59
0:03:00.856,000 --> 0:03:03,000
polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.

60
0:03:04.548,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Technology itself seemed to possess

61
0:03:06.545,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what Alvin Toffler in 1970

62
0:03:09.129,000 --> 0:03:11,000
called "accelerative thrust."

63
0:03:11.963,000 --> 0:03:12,000
For most of human history,

64
0:03:13.807,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we could go no faster than a horse

65
0:03:16.095,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or a boat with a sail,

66
0:03:18.196,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10

67
0:03:20.597,000 --> 0:03:23,000
flew at 25,000 miles an hour.

68
0:03:24.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Since 1970, no human beings

69
0:03:27.38,000 --> 0:03:28,000
have been back to the moon.

70
0:03:29.262,000 --> 0:03:31,000
No one has traveled faster than the crew

71
0:03:31.481,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of Apollo 10,

72
0:03:33.087,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and blithe optimism about technology's powers

73
0:03:36.859,000 --> 0:03:37,000
has evaporated

74
0:03:38.761,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,

75
0:03:42.332,000 --> 0:03:44,000
such as going to Mars,

76
0:03:44.635,000 --> 0:03:47,000
creating clean energy, curing cancer,

77
0:03:47.966,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or feeding the world have come to seem

78
0:03:50.775,000 --> 0:03:52,000
intractably hard.

79
0:03:53.464,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.

80
0:03:57.173,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I was five years old,

81
0:03:59.222,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and my mother told me not to stare

82
0:04:01.59,000 --> 0:04:04,000
at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.

83
0:04:04.725,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I vaguely knew this was to be the last

84
0:04:07.166,000 --> 0:04:08,000
of the moon missions,

85
0:04:08.704,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but I was absolutely certain there would be

86
0:04:12.47,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Mars colonies in my lifetime.

87
0:04:15.78,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So "Something happened

88
0:04:18.343,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"

89
0:04:22.526,000 --> 0:04:24,000
has become a commonplace.

90
0:04:24.918,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You hear it all the time.

91
0:04:26.308,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.

92
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It feels as if technologists have diverted us

93
0:04:33.688,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and enriched themselves with trivial toys,

94
0:04:36.373,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with things like iPhones and apps and social media,

95
0:04:39.878,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or algorithms that speed automated trading.

96
0:04:43.497,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.

97
0:04:45.891,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They've expanded and enriched our lives.

98
0:04:48.972,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.

99
0:04:53.673,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What happened?

100
0:04:54.886,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,

101
0:04:59.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies

102
0:05:03.245,000 --> 0:05:05,000
than it did in the years when it financed

103
0:05:05.547,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.

104
0:05:08.705,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,

105
0:05:11.265,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in particular the incentives that venture capitalists

106
0:05:14.182,000 --> 0:05:15,000
offer to entrepreneurs.

107
0:05:15.762,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Silicon Valley says that venture investing

108
0:05:17.878,000 --> 0:05:2,000
shifted away from funding transformational ideas

109
0:05:21.741,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and towards funding incremental problems

110
0:05:24.68,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or even fake problems.

111
0:05:26.728,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.

112
0:05:29.479,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.

113
0:05:33.363,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Even when venture capitalists were at their most

114
0:05:36.013,000 --> 0:05:38,000
risk-happy, they preferred small investments,

115
0:05:38.852,000 --> 0:05:41,000
tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.

116
0:05:42.716,000 --> 0:05:44,000
V.C.s have always struggled

117
0:05:45.035,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to invest profitably in technologies such as energy

118
0:05:48.11,000 --> 0:05:5,000
whose capital requirements are huge

119
0:05:50.304,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and whose development is long and lengthy,

120
0:05:53.012,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and V.C.s have never, never funded the development

121
0:05:56.169,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of technologies meant to solve big problems

122
0:05:59.167,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that possess no immediate commercial value.

123
0:06:01.861,000 --> 0:06:03,000
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems

124
0:06:04.073,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are more complicated and more profound.

125
0:06:08.155,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.

126
0:06:11.142,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We could go to Mars if we want.

127
0:06:13.56,000 --> 0:06:15,000
NASA even has the outline of a plan.

128
0:06:16.427,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But going to Mars would follow a political decision

129
0:06:19.916,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with popular appeal, and that will never happen.

130
0:06:23.27,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks

131
0:06:26.012,000 --> 0:06:27,000
there are more important things

132
0:06:27.961,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to do here on Earth.

133
0:06:30.248,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems

134
0:06:33.292,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because our political systems fail.

135
0:06:35.796,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Today, less than two percent

136
0:06:37.894,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of the world's energy consumption

137
0:06:39.581,000 --> 0:06:41,000
derives from advanced, renewable sources

138
0:06:41.747,000 --> 0:06:43,000
such as solar, wind and biofuels,

139
0:06:44.625,000 --> 0:06:45,000
less than two percent,

140
0:06:46.207,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the reason is purely economic.

141
0:06:48.311,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Coal and natural gas are cheaper

142
0:06:50.504,000 --> 0:06:51,000
than solar and wind,

143
0:06:52.249,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.

144
0:06:54.768,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We want alternative energy sources

145
0:06:57.449,000 --> 0:07:,000
that can compete on price. None exist.

146
0:07:00.45,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now, technologists, business leaders

147
0:07:03.155,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and economists all basically agree

148
0:07:05.651,000 --> 0:07:08,000
on what national policies and international treaties

149
0:07:09.152,000 --> 0:07:12,000
would spur the development of alternative energy:

150
0:07:12.436,000 --> 0:07:14,000
mostly, a significant increase in energy

151
0:07:15.151,000 --> 0:07:16,000
research and development,

152
0:07:16.568,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and some kind of price on carbon.

153
0:07:19.363,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But there's no hope in the present political climate

154
0:07:22.567,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we will see U.S. energy policy

155
0:07:24.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or international treaties that reflect that consensus.

156
0:07:29.727,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological

157
0:07:34.211,000 --> 0:07:35,000
turn out not to be so.

158
0:07:36.11,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Famines were long understood to be caused

159
0:07:39.328,000 --> 0:07:41,000
by failures in food supply.

160
0:07:41.736,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But 30 years of research have taught us

161
0:07:43.991,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that famines are political crises

162
0:07:46.659,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that catastrophically affect food distribution.

163
0:07:50.173,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Technology can improve things like crop yields

164
0:07:53.136,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or systems for storing and transporting food,

165
0:07:57.379,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.

166
0:08:02.624,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution

167
0:08:06.139,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because we don't really understand the problem.

168
0:08:09.605,000 --> 0:08:13,000
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,

169
0:08:14.549,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but we soon discovered

170
0:08:15.962,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there are many kinds of cancer,

171
0:08:18.495,000 --> 0:08:21,000
most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,

172
0:08:22.061,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and it is only in the last 10 years

173
0:08:24.271,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that effective, viable therapies

174
0:08:26.818,000 --> 0:08:28,000
have come to seem real.

175
0:08:28.875,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Hard problems are hard.

176
0:08:31.925,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.

177
0:08:36.407,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We can, we must, but these four elements

178
0:08:40.123,000 --> 0:08:41,000
must all be present:

179
0:08:41.878,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Political leaders and the public

180
0:08:43.822,000 --> 0:08:44,000
must care to solve a problem;

181
0:08:45.564,000 --> 0:08:48,000
institutions must support its solution;

182
0:08:48.735,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It must really be a technological problem;

183
0:08:51.81,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we must understand it.

184
0:08:55.661,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The Apollo mission,

185
0:08:57.108,000 --> 0:08:59,000
which has become a kind of metaphor

186
0:08:59.845,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for technology's capacity to solve big problems,

187
0:09:03.029,000 --> 0:09:05,000
met these criteria.

188
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.

189
0:09:08.667,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It is not 1961.

190
0:09:10.491,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,

191
0:09:14.582,000 --> 0:09:16,000
no politician like John Kennedy

192
0:09:16.941,000 --> 0:09:19,000
who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,

193
0:09:20.132,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and no popular science fictional mythology

194
0:09:23.477,000 --> 0:09:26,000
such as exploring the solar system.

195
0:09:26.583,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Most of all, going to the moon

196
0:09:28.985,000 --> 0:09:29,000
turned out to be easy.

197
0:09:30.847,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It was just three days away.

198
0:09:32.895,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And arguably it wasn't even solving

199
0:09:35.78,000 --> 0:09:37,000
much of a problem.

200
0:09:38.384,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We are left alone with our day,

201
0:09:42.464,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the solutions of the future will be harder won.

202
0:09:47.941,000 --> 0:09:49,000
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.

203
0:09:50.726,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you very much.

204
0:09:51.88,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
One of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,

3
0:00:17.37,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a beautiful month-old baby

4
0:00:20.15,000 --> 0:00:23,000
who was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection.

5
0:00:23.83,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Until then, I had never seen a patient worsen so fast.

6
0:00:28.81,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In just two days she was connected to a respirator

7
0:00:31.81,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and on the third day she died.

8
0:00:34.55,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Sol had whooping cough.

9
0:00:37.3,000 --> 0:00:41,000
After discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis,

10
0:00:42.46,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I remember my chief resident said to me,

11
0:00:44.509,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.

12
0:00:48.43,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And now comes the hardest part:

13
0:00:51.05,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We have to go talk to her parents."

14
0:00:54.15,000 --> 0:00:57,000
At that time, a thousand questions came to mind,

15
0:00:58.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from, "How could a one-month-old baby be so unfortunate?"

16
0:01:03.2,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to, "Could we have done something about it?"

17
0:01:07.4,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Before vaccines existed,

18
0:01:09.68,000 --> 0:01:13,000
many infectious diseases killed millions of people per year.

19
0:01:15.1,000 --> 0:01:18,000
During the 1918 flu pandemic

20
0:01:18.63,000 --> 0:01:21,000
50 million people died.

21
0:01:21.78,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's greater than Argentina's current population.

22
0:01:25.06,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Perhaps, the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic

23
0:01:29.11,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that occurred in Argentina in 1956.

24
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
At that time, there was no vaccine available against polio.

25
0:01:35.56,000 --> 0:01:37,000
People didn't know what to do. They were going crazy.

26
0:01:38.09,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They would go painting trees with caustic lime.

27
0:01:40.37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They'd put little bags of camphor

28
0:01:41.94,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in their children's underwear, as if that could do something.

29
0:01:46.08,000 --> 0:01:5,000
During the polio epidemic, thousands of people died.

30
0:01:50.6,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage.

31
0:01:56.65,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I know this because I read about it,

32
0:01:59.29,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because thanks to vaccines, my generation was lucky

33
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to not live through an epidemic as terrible as this.

34
0:02:05.89,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Vaccines are one of the great successes of the 20th century's public health.

35
0:02:11.21,000 --> 0:02:13,000
After potable water,

36
0:02:13.23,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they are the interventions that have most reduced mortality,

37
0:02:16.84,000 --> 0:02:18,000
even more than antibiotics.

38
0:02:19.57,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet

39
0:02:24.59,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and succeeded in significantly reducing mortality

40
0:02:28.2,000 --> 0:02:3,000
due to other diseases such as measles,

41
0:02:30.45,000 --> 0:02:33,000
whooping cough, polio and many more.

42
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
All these diseases are considered vaccine-preventable diseases.

43
0:02:41.91,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What does this mean?

44
0:02:43.67,000 --> 0:02:46,000
That they are potentially preventable,

45
0:02:46.69,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but in order to be so, something must be done.

46
0:02:49.66,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You need to get vaccinated.

47
0:02:52.27,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I imagine that most, if not all of us here today,

48
0:02:55.97,000 --> 0:02:58,000
received a vaccine at some point in our life.

49
0:03:00.51,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, I'm not so sure that many of us know

50
0:03:04.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence.

51
0:03:10.71,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Have you ever wondered who we are protecting

52
0:03:14.79,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when we vaccinate?

53
0:03:17.07,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What do I mean by that?

54
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Is there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves?

55
0:03:25.05,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Let me show you something.

56
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Imagine for a moment

57
0:03:30.22,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that we are in a city

58
0:03:32.23,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that has never had a case of a particular disease,

59
0:03:35.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
such as the measles.

60
0:03:37.43,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease.

61
0:03:42.29,000 --> 0:03:46,000
No one has natural defenses against, nor been vaccinated against measles.

62
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If one day, a person sick with the measles appears in this city

63
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the disease won't find much resistance

64
0:03:56.51,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and will begin spreading from person to person,

65
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and in no time it will disseminate throughout the community.

66
0:04:03.81,000 --> 0:04:04,000
After a certain time

67
0:04:05.53,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a big part of the population will be ill.

68
0:04:09.75,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This happened when there were no vaccines.

69
0:04:14.63,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, imagine the complete opposite case.

70
0:04:19.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We are in a city

71
0:04:21.83,000 --> 0:04:23,000
where more than 90 percent of the population

72
0:04:24.65,000 --> 0:04:26,000
has defenses against the measles, which means

73
0:04:27.1,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that they either had the disease, survived, and developed natural defenses;

74
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or that they had been immunized against measles.

75
0:04:35.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
If one day,

76
0:04:36.81,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a person sick with the measles appears in this city,

77
0:04:41.23,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the disease will find much more resistance

78
0:04:44.61,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and won't be transmitted that much from person to person.

79
0:04:48.78,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The spread will probably remain contained

80
0:04:52.75,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and a measles outbreak won't happen.

81
0:04:57.06,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I would like you to pay attention to something.

82
0:05:00.81,000 --> 0:05:02,000
People who are vaccinated

83
0:05:03.49,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are not only protecting themselves,

84
0:05:06.29,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but by blocking the dissemination of the disease

85
0:05:09.9,000 --> 0:05:1,000
within the community,

86
0:05:11.54,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they are indirectly protecting the people in this community

87
0:05:16.22,000 --> 0:05:18,000
who are not vaccinated.

88
0:05:18.69,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They create a kind of protective shield

89
0:05:21.66,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which prevents them from coming in contact with the disease,

90
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so that these people are protected.

91
0:05:28.67,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This indirect protection

92
0:05:31.87,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that the unvaccinated people within a community receive

93
0:05:35.37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
simply by being surrounded by vaccinated people,

94
0:05:39.95,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is called herd immunity.

95
0:05:45.13,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Many people in the community

96
0:05:47.59,000 --> 0:05:5,000
depend almost exclusively on this herd immunity

97
0:05:51.09,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to be protected against disease.

98
0:05:54.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical.

99
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Those people are our nieces and nephews, our children,

100
0:06:02.6,000 --> 0:06:05,000
who may be too young to receive their first shots.

101
0:06:07.1,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They are our parents, our siblings,

102
0:06:09.41,000 --> 0:06:1,000
our acquaintances,

103
0:06:10.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
who may have a disease,

104
0:06:12.71,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or take medication that lowers their defenses.

105
0:06:18.01,000 --> 0:06:22,000
There are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine.

106
0:06:23.35,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They could even be among us,

107
0:06:25.75,000 --> 0:06:26,000
any of us who got vaccinated,

108
0:06:27.61,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect,

109
0:06:31.41,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because not all vaccines are always 100 percent effective.

110
0:06:35.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
All these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity

111
0:06:40.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to be protected against diseases.

112
0:06:44.39,000 --> 0:06:48,000
To achieve this effect of herd immunity,

113
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:53,000
it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated.

114
0:06:54.5,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This percentage is called the threshold.

115
0:06:57.57,000 --> 0:07:,000
The threshold depends on many variables:

116
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It depends on the germ's characteristics,

117
0:07:03.74,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and those of the immune response that the vaccine generates.

118
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But they all have something in common.

119
0:07:10.43,000 --> 0:07:15,000
If the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community

120
0:07:15.98,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is below this threshold number,

121
0:07:19.05,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the disease will begin to spread more freely

122
0:07:23.11,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community.

123
0:07:27.78,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Even diseases which were at some point controlled may reappear.

124
0:07:36.55,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is not just a theory.

125
0:07:38.74,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This has happened, and is still happening.

126
0:07:43.05,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In 1998, a British researcher published an article

127
0:07:47.75,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in one of the most important medical journals,

128
0:07:50.53,000 --> 0:07:52,000
saying that the MMR vaccine,

129
0:07:53.15,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which is given for measles, mumps and rubella,

130
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
was associated with autism.

131
0:07:57.75,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This generated an immediate impact.

132
0:08:01.01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
People began to stop getting vaccinated, and stopped vaccinating their children.

133
0:08:05.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And what happened?

134
0:08:07.3,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The number of people vaccinated,

135
0:08:09.98,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in many communities around the world, fell below this threshold.

136
0:08:13.96,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world --

137
0:08:17.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in the U.S., in Europe.

138
0:08:19.96,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Many people got sick.

139
0:08:22.12,000 --> 0:08:24,000
People died of measles.

140
0:08:25.87,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What happened?

141
0:08:27.35,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This article also generated a huge stir within the medical community.

142
0:08:32.02,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Dozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true.

143
0:08:37.13,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Not only could no one find

144
0:08:40.42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a causal association between MMR and autism at the population level,

145
0:08:45.669,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but it was also found that this article had incorrect claims.

146
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Even more, it was fraudulent.

147
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It was fraudulent.

148
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In fact, the journal publicly retracted the article in 2010.

149
0:09:04.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated

150
0:09:08.78,000 --> 0:09:1,000
are the adverse effects.

151
0:09:11.77,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Vaccines, like other drugs, can have potential adverse effects.

152
0:09:17.97,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Most are mild and temporary.

153
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But the benefits are always greater than possible complications.

154
0:09:27.74,000 --> 0:09:31,000
When we are ill, we want to heal fast.

155
0:09:32.3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Many of us who are here

156
0:09:34.42,000 --> 0:09:37,000
take antibiotics when we have an infection,

157
0:09:38.09,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we take anti-hypertensives when we have high blood pressure,

158
0:09:41.27,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we take cardiac medications.

159
0:09:43.45,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Why? Because we are sick and we want to heal fast.

160
0:09:46.7,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And we don't question it much.

161
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Why is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases,

162
0:09:53.89,000 --> 0:09:56,000
by taking care of ourselves when we are healthy?

163
0:09:57.1,000 --> 0:10:,000
We take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness,

164
0:10:00.29,000 --> 0:10:02,000
or in situations of imminent danger.

165
0:10:04.14,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I imagine most of us here,

166
0:10:06.81,000 --> 0:10:09,000
remember the influenza-A pandemic

167
0:10:10.54,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which broke out in 2009 in Argentina and worldwide.

168
0:10:14.49,000 --> 0:10:17,000
When the first cases began to come to light,

169
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we, here in Argentina, were entering the winter season.

170
0:10:21.91,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We knew absolutely nothing.

171
0:10:24.12,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Everything was a mess.

172
0:10:25.53,000 --> 0:10:3,000
People wore masks on the street, ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.

173
0:10:30.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
People would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine,

174
0:10:34.25,000 --> 0:10:36,000
without even knowing if it was the right vaccine

175
0:10:36.81,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that would protect them against this new virus.

176
0:10:39.35,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We knew absolutely nothing.

177
0:10:41.65,000 --> 0:10:45,000
At that time, in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation,

178
0:10:46.74,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company.

179
0:10:51.67,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I remember that I started my shift at 8 a.m.,

180
0:10:54.91,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and by 8, I already had a list of 50 scheduled visits.

181
0:10:59.06,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It was chaos; people didn't know what to do.

182
0:11:02.86,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I remember the types of patients that I was examining.

183
0:11:07.69,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter,

184
0:11:12.05,000 --> 0:11:14,000
with longer fevers.

185
0:11:14.39,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor,

186
0:11:18.07,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and he, for his part, had heard the same from a colleague,

187
0:11:21.59,000 --> 0:11:23,000
about the large number of pregnant women

188
0:11:24.32,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and young adults

189
0:11:26.01,000 --> 0:11:28,000
being hospitalized in intensive care,

190
0:11:28.25,000 --> 0:11:3,000
with hard-to-manage clinical profiles.

191
0:11:32.76,000 --> 0:11:37,000
At that time, we set out to understand what was happening.

192
0:11:39.3,000 --> 0:11:42,000
First thing Monday morning, we took the car

193
0:11:42.42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province,

194
0:11:45.35,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus.

195
0:11:51.02,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We arrived at the hospital; it was crowded.

196
0:11:53.55,000 --> 0:11:56,000
All health staff were dressed in NASA-like bio-safety suits.

197
0:11:57.47,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We all had face masks in our pockets.

198
0:11:59.67,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I, being a hypochondriac, didn't breathe for two hours.

199
0:12:02.4,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But we could see what was happening.

200
0:12:05.52,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Immediately, we started reaching out to pediatricians

201
0:12:09.21,000 --> 0:12:13,000
from six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province.

202
0:12:13.44,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Our main goal was to find out

203
0:12:16.77,000 --> 0:12:19,000
how this new virus behaved in contact with our children,

204
0:12:20.66,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the shortest time possible.

205
0:12:23.24,000 --> 0:12:25,000
A marathon work.

206
0:12:26.2,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In less than three months,

207
0:12:29.07,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we could see what effect this new H1N1 virus had

208
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
on the 251 children hospitalized by this virus.

209
0:12:41.52,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We could see which children got more seriously ill:

210
0:12:45.5,000 --> 0:12:48,000
children under four, especially those less than one year old;

211
0:12:49.12,000 --> 0:12:51,000
patients with neurological diseases;

212
0:12:51.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and young children with chronic pulmonary diseases.

213
0:12:55.21,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Identifying these at-risk groups was important

214
0:13:00.02,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to include them as priority groups

215
0:13:02.73,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine,

216
0:13:05.73,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not only here in Argentina,

217
0:13:07.59,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached.

218
0:13:12.75,000 --> 0:13:13,000
A year later,

219
0:13:14.43,000 --> 0:13:19,000
when a vaccine against the pandemic H1N1 virus became available,

220
0:13:19.52,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we wanted to see what happened.

221
0:13:22.24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
After a huge vaccination campaign

222
0:13:25.41,000 --> 0:13:29,000
aimed at protecting at-risk groups,

223
0:13:30.18,000 --> 0:13:36,000
these hospitals, with 93 percent of the at-risk groups vaccinated,

224
0:13:37.14,000 --> 0:13:4,000
had not hospitalized a single patient

225
0:13:40.77,000 --> 0:13:42,000
for the pandemic H1N1 virus.

226
0:13:43.45,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

227
0:13:47.92,000 --> 0:13:5,000
In 2009: 251.

228
0:13:53.49,000 --> 0:13:55,000
In 2010: zero.

229
0:13:56.44,000 --> 0:14:,000
Vaccination is an act of individual responsibility,

230
0:14:01.22,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but it has a huge collective impact.

231
0:14:06.79,000 --> 0:14:1,000
If I get vaccinated, not only am I protecting myself,

232
0:14:11.42,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but I am also protecting others.

233
0:14:15.52,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Sol had whooping cough.

234
0:14:19.5,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Sol was very young,

235
0:14:21.7,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough.

236
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I still wonder what would have happened

237
0:14:30.96,000 --> 0:14:35,000
if everyone around Sol had been vaccinated.

238
0:14:37.74,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

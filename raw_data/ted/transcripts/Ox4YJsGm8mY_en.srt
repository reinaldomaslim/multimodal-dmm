1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:14,000
(Music: "East Virginia")

2
0:00:15.458,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Banjo)

3
0:00:52.958,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Singing) I'm from

4
0:00:56.667,000 --> 0:01:02,000
old East Virginia.

5
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:07,000
North Carolina

6
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I did go.

7
0:01:11.708,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I met

8
0:01:13.583,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a fair, young maiden.

9
0:01:21.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Her name I did not know.

10
0:01:26.75,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Banjo)

11
0:02:05.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Don't that road

12
0:02:08.667,000 --> 0:02:13,000
look rough and rocky?

13
0:02:16.167,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Don't that sea look wide and deep?

14
0:02:21.792,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Don't my darlin'

15
0:02:25.917,000 --> 0:02:28,000
look

16
0:02:29.292,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the sweetest ...

17
0:02:33.417,000 --> 0:02:35,000
When she's in my arms asleep?

18
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Banjo)

19
0:03:05.167,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Her hair

20
0:03:08.958,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was a dark-brown curly.

21
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Her cheeks were chestnut red.

22
0:03:22.292,000 --> 0:03:24,000
On her breast

23
0:03:24.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
she wore a white lilly.

24
0:03:32.042,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Through the night, the tears she shed.

25
0:03:35.083,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Banjo)

26
0:04:06.833,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Captain,

27
0:04:10.458,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Captain, I am dyin'.

28
0:04:17.958,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Won't you take these words for me?

29
0:04:24.458,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Take them back

30
0:04:26.042,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to old East Virginia.

31
0:04:33.083,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Tell my darlin' she is free.

32
0:04:38.417,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Banjo)

33
0:04:41.375,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Music ends)

34
0:04:44.042,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Applause and cheers)

35
0:04:52.25,000 --> 0:04:54,000
That was a song called "East Virginia"

36
0:04:54.875,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I learned from a man named Clifton Hicks

37
0:04:56.833,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who lives down in Georgia.

38
0:04:59.333,000 --> 0:05:,000
The next song ...

39
0:05:02.417,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I have for you

40
0:05:05.375,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is called "John Brown's Dream."

41
0:05:07.667,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's an old dance tune.

42
0:05:09.708,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And you may notice that the banjo that I'm holding looks a little different

43
0:05:13.417,000 --> 0:05:15,000
than banjos you might be used to seeing

44
0:05:15.792,000 --> 0:05:18,000
or the one I just played, for example.

45
0:05:18.958,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And this banjo is sort of an earlier model.

46
0:05:24.042,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Banjos kind of evolved like a human has.

47
0:05:27.292,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I like to say that the sound that comes out of this banjo

48
0:05:31.375,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is a sound that was just a little closer to the source,

49
0:05:36.375,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which is Africa,

50
0:05:37.708,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and some people forget that,

51
0:05:39.167,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so, yeah ...

52
0:05:40.958,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Banjo tuning)

53
0:05:51.792,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Music: "John Brown's Dream")

54
0:05:54.125,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Banjo)

55
0:06:54.125,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Banjo continues)

56
0:07:43.542,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Singing) John Brown's dream,

57
0:07:45.667,000 --> 0:07:46,000
John Brown's dream the devil was dead.

58
0:07:47.542,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I'm gonna get that, get that, get that,

59
0:07:49.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

60
0:07:51.375,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Banjo)

61
0:08:38.708,000 --> 0:08:4,000
John Brown's dream,

62
0:08:40.833,000 --> 0:08:42,000
John Brown's dream the devil was dead.

63
0:08:42.958,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Banjo)

64
0:08:46.332,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Come on, Liza, Liza, Liza.

65
0:08:48.207,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Come on, Liza we'll be pickin' it again.

66
0:08:50.167,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'm gonna get that, get that, get that,

67
0:08:52.082,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

68
0:08:53.957,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Banjo)

69
0:09:00.125,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Music ends)

70
0:09:02.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Applause and cheers)

71
0:09:08.083,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Thank you very much.

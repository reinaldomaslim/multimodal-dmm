1
0:00:12.613,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So why do we learn mathematics?

2
0:00:15.652,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Essentially, for three reasons:

3
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:19,000
calculation,

4
0:00:19.828,000 --> 0:00:2,000
application,

5
0:00:21.728,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and last, and unfortunately least

6
0:00:24.415,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in terms of the time we give it,

7
0:00:26.52,000 --> 0:00:27,000
inspiration.

8
0:00:28.442,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Mathematics is the science of patterns,

9
0:00:30.714,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and we study it to learn how to think logically,

10
0:00:34.072,000 --> 0:00:36,000
critically and creatively,

11
0:00:36.599,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school

12
0:00:39.525,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is not effectively motivated,

13
0:00:41.844,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and when our students ask,

14
0:00:43.269,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Why are we learning this?"

15
0:00:44.944,000 --> 0:00:45,000
then they often hear that they'll need it

16
0:00:46.905,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in an upcoming math class or on a future test.

17
0:00:50.17,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But wouldn't it be great

18
0:00:51.972,000 --> 0:00:53,000
if every once in a while we did mathematics

19
0:00:54.49,000 --> 0:00:56,000
simply because it was fun or beautiful

20
0:00:57.439,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or because it excited the mind?

21
0:00:59.529,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, I know many people have not

22
0:01:01.251,000 --> 0:01:03,000
had the opportunity to see how this can happen,

23
0:01:03.57,000 --> 0:01:04,000
so let me give you a quick example

24
0:01:05.399,000 --> 0:01:07,000
with my favorite collection of numbers,

25
0:01:07.74,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)

26
0:01:10.468,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.

27
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That's great.

28
0:01:13.836,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now these numbers can be appreciated

29
0:01:15.952,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in many different ways.

30
0:01:17.83,000 --> 0:01:19,000
From the standpoint of calculation,

31
0:01:20.539,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they're as easy to understand

32
0:01:22.216,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as one plus one, which is two.

33
0:01:24.77,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Then one plus two is three,

34
0:01:26.773,000 --> 0:01:29,000
two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,

35
0:01:29.787,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and so on.

36
0:01:31.312,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci

37
0:01:33.489,000 --> 0:01:36,000
was actually named Leonardo of Pisa,

38
0:01:36.669,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,"

39
0:01:39.722,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which taught the Western world

40
0:01:41.372,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the methods of arithmetic that we use today.

41
0:01:44.199,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In terms of applications,

42
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Fibonacci numbers appear in nature

43
0:01:48.103,000 --> 0:01:49,000
surprisingly often.

44
0:01:49.96,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The number of petals on a flower

45
0:01:51.7,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is typically a Fibonacci number,

46
0:01:53.562,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or the number of spirals on a sunflower

47
0:01:56.332,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or a pineapple

48
0:01:57.743,000 --> 0:01:59,000
tends to be a Fibonacci number as well.

49
0:02:00.137,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers,

50
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but what I find most inspirational about them

51
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:08,000
are the beautiful number patterns they display.

52
0:02:08.934,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Let me show you one of my favorites.

53
0:02:11.128,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Suppose you like to square numbers,

54
0:02:13.349,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)

55
0:02:16.04,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Let's look at the squares

56
0:02:18.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of the first few Fibonacci numbers.

57
0:02:20.131,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So one squared is one,

58
0:02:22.161,000 --> 0:02:24,000
two squared is four, three squared is nine,

59
0:02:24.478,000 --> 0:02:27,000
five squared is 25, and so on.

60
0:02:27.651,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, it's no surprise

61
0:02:29.552,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,

62
0:02:32.38,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?

63
0:02:34.412,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That's how they're created.

64
0:02:35.807,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But you wouldn't expect anything special

65
0:02:37.58,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to happen when you add the squares together.

66
0:02:40.656,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But check this out.

67
0:02:42.002,000 --> 0:02:44,000
One plus one gives us two,

68
0:02:44.003,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and one plus four gives us five.

69
0:02:46.765,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And four plus nine is 13,

70
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
nine plus 25 is 34,

71
0:02:52.173,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and yes, the pattern continues.

72
0:02:54.832,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In fact, here's another one.

73
0:02:56.453,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Suppose you wanted to look at

74
0:02:58.297,000 --> 0:03:,000
adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers.

75
0:03:00.795,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Let's see what we get there.

76
0:03:02.403,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So one plus one plus four is six.

77
0:03:04.542,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Add nine to that, we get 15.

78
0:03:07.547,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Add 25, we get 40.

79
0:03:09.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Add 64, we get 104.

80
0:03:12.551,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now look at those numbers.

81
0:03:14.203,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Those are not Fibonacci numbers,

82
0:03:16.587,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but if you look at them closely,

83
0:03:18.466,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you'll see the Fibonacci numbers

84
0:03:20.349,000 --> 0:03:22,000
buried inside of them.

85
0:03:22.527,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Do you see it? I'll show it to you.

86
0:03:24.597,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,

87
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
40 is five times eight,

88
0:03:30.389,000 --> 0:03:32,000
two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?

89
0:03:33.317,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:34.504,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Fibonacci! Of course.

91
0:03:36.659,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,

92
0:03:40.442,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's even more satisfying to understand

93
0:03:42.924,000 --> 0:03:43,000
why they are true.

94
0:03:44.882,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Let's look at that last equation.

95
0:03:46.771,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight

96
0:03:50.639,000 --> 0:03:52,000
add up to eight times 13?

97
0:03:53.184,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.

98
0:03:56.145,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We'll start with a one-by-one square

99
0:03:58.832,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and next to that put another one-by-one square.

100
0:04:02.997,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.

101
0:04:06.405,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,

102
0:04:08.954,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and next to that, a three-by-three square,

103
0:04:11.749,000 --> 0:04:13,000
beneath that, a five-by-five square,

104
0:04:13.75,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and then an eight-by-eight square,

105
0:04:15.662,000 --> 0:04:17,000
creating one giant rectangle, right?

106
0:04:18.234,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now let me ask you a simple question:

107
0:04:20.15,000 --> 0:04:23,000
what is the area of the rectangle?

108
0:04:23.806,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Well, on the one hand,

109
0:04:25.777,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it's the sum of the areas

110
0:04:28.307,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of the squares inside it, right?

111
0:04:30.173,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Just as we created it.

112
0:04:31.532,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's one squared plus one squared

113
0:04:33.704,000 --> 0:04:35,000
plus two squared plus three squared

114
0:04:35.937,000 --> 0:04:37,000
plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?

115
0:04:38.536,000 --> 0:04:39,000
That's the area.

116
0:04:40.393,000 --> 0:04:42,000
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,

117
0:04:42.719,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the area is equal to its height times its base,

118
0:04:46.367,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the height is clearly eight,

119
0:04:48.414,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and the base is five plus eight,

120
0:04:51.317,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?

121
0:04:55.255,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So the area is also eight times 13.

122
0:04:58.618,000 --> 0:05:,000
Since we've correctly calculated the area

123
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:01,000
two different ways,

124
0:05:02.567,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they have to be the same number,

125
0:05:04.739,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight

126
0:05:08.13,000 --> 0:05:1,000
add up to eight times 13.

127
0:05:10.421,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, if we continue this process,

128
0:05:12.795,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,

129
0:05:16.773,000 --> 0:05:18,000
21 by 34, and so on.

130
0:05:19.167,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now check this out.

131
0:05:20.576,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you divide 13 by eight,

132
0:05:22.769,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you get 1.625.

133
0:05:24.812,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number,

134
0:05:28.239,000 --> 0:05:3,000
then these ratios get closer and closer

135
0:05:31.112,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to about 1.618,

136
0:05:33.765,000 --> 0:05:36,000
known to many people as the Golden Ratio,

137
0:05:37.066,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a number which has fascinated mathematicians,

138
0:05:39.662,000 --> 0:05:42,000
scientists and artists for centuries.

139
0:05:42.908,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, I show all this to you because,

140
0:05:45.139,000 --> 0:05:47,000
like so much of mathematics,

141
0:05:47.164,000 --> 0:05:48,000
there's a beautiful side to it

142
0:05:49.131,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that I fear does not get enough attention

143
0:05:51.146,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in our schools.

144
0:05:52.713,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We spend lots of time learning about calculation,

145
0:05:55.546,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but let's not forget about application,

146
0:05:58.302,000 --> 0:06:01,000
including, perhaps, the most important application of all,

147
0:06:01.756,000 --> 0:06:03,000
learning how to think.

148
0:06:03.832,000 --> 0:06:04,000
If I could summarize this in one sentence,

149
0:06:05.789,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it would be this:

150
0:06:07.25,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Mathematics is not just solving for x,

151
0:06:10.61,000 --> 0:06:12,000
it's also figuring out why.

152
0:06:13.535,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Thank you very much.

153
0:06:15.35,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

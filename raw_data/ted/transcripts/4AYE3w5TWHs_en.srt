1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The public debate about architecture

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the architectural object.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Is the latest tower in London

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a gherkin or a sausage

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or a sex tool?

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So recently, we asked ourselves

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
if we could invent a format

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
maybe combining images and drawings and words

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it already existed in the form of a comic book.

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So we basically copied the format of the comic book

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
how our projects actually evolve through adaptation

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and improvisation.

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the incidents of the real world.

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We call this comic book "Yes is More,"

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He triggered the modernist revolution.

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."

26
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced

27
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you could say promiscuity, or at least openness

29
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to new ideas with, "I am a whore."

30
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism

31
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at a sort of time of global financial crisis.

32
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"

33
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is basically trying to question this idea

34
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as who or what we are against.

36
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The cliche of the radical architect

37
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.

38
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,

39
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
this idea that things gradually evolve

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by adapting and improvising

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to the changes of the world.

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
who best explains our design process.

46
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
His famous evolutionary tree

47
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
could almost be a diagram of the way we work.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
As you can see, a project evolves through

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
a series of generations of design meetings.

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Only the best ones can survive.

52
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And through a process of architectural selection,

53
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we might choose a really beautiful model

54
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or we might have a very functional model.

55
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.

56
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And through these sort of generations of design meetings

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we arrive at a design.

58
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did

59
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.

60
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The design process was really tough,

61
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
almost like a struggle for survival,

62
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but gradually an idea evolved:

63
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
this sort of idea of a rational tower

64
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that melts together with the surrounding city,

65
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as

66
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,

67
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,

68
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
with the library.

69
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.

70
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.

71
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And quite often we sit in a design meeting

72
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and we discover that there is this great idea.

73
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It doesn't really work in this context.

74
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But for another client in another culture,

75
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it could really be the right answer to a different question.

76
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So as a result, we never throw anything out.

77
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We keep our office almost like an archive

78
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of architectural biodiversity.

79
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You never know when you might need it.

80
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And what I'd like to do now, in an act of

81
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
warp-speed storytelling,

82
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is tell the story of how two projects evolved

83
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
by adapting and improvising

84
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the happenstance of the world.

85
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai

86
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to do the competition for the Danish

87
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.

88
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And we saw this guy, Haibao.

89
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
He's the mascot of the expo,

90
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and he looks strangely familiar.

91
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In fact he looked like a building we had designed

92
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for a hotel in the north of Sweden.

93
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought

94
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly

95
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
look like something from the north of Sweden.

96
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.

97
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman

98
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who saw our design and said,

99
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"

100
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, apparently this is how you write "people,"

102
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as in the People's Republic of China.

103
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We even double checked.

104
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit

105
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.

106
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,

107
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so we hired a feng shui master.

108
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,

109
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and went to China.

110
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So the People's Building, as we called it.

112
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.

113
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,

114
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,

115
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to visit the exhibition.

116
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we had the chance to explain the project.

117
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world

118
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with most skyscrapers,"

119
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.

120
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture

121
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China

122
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and the progressive future of China.

123
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.

124
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

126
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.

127
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,

129
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because he is actually the Chinese character for "people."

130
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And they chose this mascot because

131
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."

132
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Sustainability.

133
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we thought, sustainability has grown into being

134
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
this sort of neo-Protestant idea

135
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that it has to hurt in order to do good.

136
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.

137
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.

138
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life

139
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is less fun than normal life.

140
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples

141
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
where a sustainable city

142
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
actually increases the quality of life.

143
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China

144
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that would be relevant?

145
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.

146
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
China symbolized by the dragon.

147
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.

148
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
China has many great poets,

150
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but we discovered that in the People's Republic

151
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
public school curriculum,

152
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,

153
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.

154
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese

155
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"

156
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."

157
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture

158
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
integrated into Chinese culture.

159
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.

160
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.

161
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.

162
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.

163
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.

165
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Copenhagen, Shanghai,

166
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
modern, European.

167
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But then we looked at recent urban development,

168
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,

169
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.

170
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.

171
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.

172
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.

173
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
A third of all the people commute by bike.

174
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike

175
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that you can borrow if you visit the city.

176
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?

177
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.

178
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,

179
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.

180
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,

181
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean

182
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that you can actually swim in it.

183
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
One of the first projects we ever did

184
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was the harbor bath in Copenhagen,

185
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
sort of continuing the public realm into the water.

186
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of

187
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
state financed propaganda,

188
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
images, statements, but no real experience.

189
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.

190
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You can try it.

191
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Like with the water, instead of talking about it,

192
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water

193
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
from Copenhagen to Shanghai,

194
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in

195
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and feel how clean it is.

196
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable

197
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to sail water from Copenhagen to China.

198
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But in fact, the container ships go

199
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
full of goods from China to Denmark,

200
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and then they sail empty back.

201
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So quite often you load water for ballast.

202
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.

203
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,

204
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.

205
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.

206
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And when she's gone, we're going to invite

207
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.

208
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop

209
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of exhibition and bikes.

210
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.

211
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,

212
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.

213
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So when we actually won the competition

214
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.

215
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back

216
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.

217
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.

218
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.

219
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,

220
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and then the Chinese state said,

221
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
"Suggest change to panda."

222
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

224
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to

225
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
move our national monument,

226
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.

227
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.

228
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.

229
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,

230
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they were discussing the bailout package --

231
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.

232
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.

233
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And then from 11 to 1,

234
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.

235
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

236
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

237
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December

238
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
next year, don't come to Copenhagen,

239
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because she's going to be in Shanghai.

240
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If you do come to Copenhagen,

241
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.

242
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.

243
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So the second story that I'd like to tell

245
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is, actually starts in my own house.

246
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This is my apartment.

247
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This is the view from my apartment,

248
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies

249
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.

250
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And they form this sort of vertical backyard

251
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors

252
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.

253
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.

254
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Trying to zigzag it to make sure

255
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that all of the apartments look at the straight views,

256
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
instead of into each other.

257
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Until recently, this was the view from my apartment,

258
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.

259
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block

260
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
next to a parking structure.

261
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments

262
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
looking straight into a big boring block of cars,

263
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,

264
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
put them on a podium of cars.

265
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And because Copenhagen is completely flat,

266
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,

267
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you basically have to do it yourself.

268
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Then we sort of cut up the volume,

269
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.

270
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space

272
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
underneath the apartments.

273
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments

274
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,

275
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,

276
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and a sort of dense urban location.

277
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is our first architectural model.

278
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.

279
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.

280
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.

281
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,

282
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.

283
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

284
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And the facade of the parking,

285
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,

286
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so we needed to perforate it.

287
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,

288
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we could actually turn the entire facade

289
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
into a gigantic, naturally ventilated,

290
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
rasterized image.

291
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,

292
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer

293
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,

294
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.

295
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause)

296
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,

297
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe

298
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
from cars and colors,

299
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.

300
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.

301
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.

302
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain

303
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is actually accumulated.

304
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And there is an automatic irrigation system

305
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,

306
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in one or two years it will sort of transform

307
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
into a Cambodian temple ruin,

308
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
completely covered in green.

309
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So, the Mountain is like our first built example

310
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.

311
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,

312
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
then at least added value by mixing

313
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
traditional ingredients, like normal apartments

314
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and normal parking,

315
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and in this case actually offer people

316
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the chance that they don't have to choose between

317
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
a life with a garden or a life in the city.

318
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They can actually have both.

319
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.

320
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city

321
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
in central Asia,

322
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because that's not really how you get commissions.

323
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise

324
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to the opportunities and accidents that happen,

325
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and the sort of turmoil of the world.

326
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
One last example is that recently we,

327
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like last summer, we won the competition

328
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to design a Nordic national bank.

329
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.

330
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Laughter)

331
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.

332
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Unfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.

333
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
At the same time, we actually had a visitor --

334
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.

335
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited

336
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
by this idea that you could actually make mountains

337
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
out of architecture,

338
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.

339
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So he asked us if we could actually imagine

340
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
an urban master plan

341
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
on an island outside the capital

342
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains

343
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of Azerbaijan.

344
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So we took the commission.

345
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.

346
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We quite often make little movies.

347
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We always argue a lot about the soundtrack,

348
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.

349
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay

350
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
overlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning --

351
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
almost like the diagram of their flag.

352
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And our main idea was

353
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains

354
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
of the topography of Azerbaijan

355
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,

356
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
inhabitable of human life.

357
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Then we place these mountains on the island,

358
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
surrounding this sort of central green valley,

359
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
almost like a central park.

360
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now

361
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.

362
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.

363
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,

364
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,

365
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and to use the thermal properties of water

366
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
to heat and cool the buildings.

367
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater

368
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
is filtered organically into the landscape,

369
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
gradually transforming the desert island

370
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
into sort of a green, lush landscape.

371
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So, you can say where an urban development

372
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
normally happens at the expense of nature,

373
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in this case it's actually creating nature.

374
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And the buildings, they don't only sort of

375
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
invoke the imagery of the mountains,

376
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
they also operate like mountains.

377
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
They create shelter from the wind.

378
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
They accumulate the solar energy.

379
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
They accumulate the water.

380
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So they actually transform the entire island

381
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
into a single ecosystem.

382
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So we recently presented the master plan,

383
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and it has gotten approved.

384
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And this summer we are starting the construction documents

385
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
of the two first mountains,

386
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island

387
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
in Central Asia.

388
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

389
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Yes, maybe just to round off.

390
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen

391
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.

392
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
With a little luck and some more evolution,

393
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.

394
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Thank you.

395
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I was growing up in Montana,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I had two dreams.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I wanted to be a paleontologist,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a dinosaur paleontologist,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And so that's what I've been striving for

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
all of my life.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was very fortunate

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
early in my career.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was fortunate

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in finding things.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I wasn't very good at reading things.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In fact, I don't read much of anything.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I am extremely dyslexic,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and so reading is the hardest thing I do.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But instead, I go out and I find things.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Then I just pick things up.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I basically practice for finding money on the street.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I wander about the hills,

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I have found a few things.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I have been fortunate enough

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the first dinosaur embryos

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and massive accumulations of bones.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it happened to be at a time

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when people were just starting to begin to realize

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that people had thought for so many years.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
People were starting to get an idea

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that dinosaurs were special.

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And so, at that time,

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
along with my colleagues.

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We were able to actually say

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that dinosaurs built nests

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and lived in colonies

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and cared for their young,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
brought food to their babies

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and traveled in gigantic herds.

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So it was pretty interesting stuff.

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I have gone on to find more things

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We have found a lot of evidence

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that dinosaurs changed

48
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The appearance of them would have been different --

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which it is in all social animals.

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In social groups of animals,

52
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the juveniles always look different than the adults.

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The adults can recognize the juveniles;

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the juveniles can recognize the adults.

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so we're making a better picture

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of what a dinosaur looks like.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But it is that social thing

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then Steven Spielberg, of course,

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
depicts these dinosaurs

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
as being very social creatures.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people

68
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You all know the story, right.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If you want to make a dinosaur,

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --

73
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
otherwise known as amber --

74
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that has some blood-sucking insects in it,

75
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
good ones,

76
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and you get your insect and you drill into it

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and you suck out some DNA,

78
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days

79
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
sucked dinosaur DNA out.

80
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and you clone it.

82
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,

83
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or something like that,

84
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and then you wait,

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.

86
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And everybody's happy about that.

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And they're happy over and over again.

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.

90
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And then, then, then, and then ...

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Then the dinosaurs, being social,

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
act out their socialness,

93
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and they get together,

94
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and they conspire.

95
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --

96
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.

97
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I assume everybody knows

98
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,

99
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and you drilled into it,

100
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and you got something out of that insect,

101
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,

102
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you'd have a room full of mosquitos.

103
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.

106
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now if you want dinosaur DNA,

107
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I say go to the dinosaur.

108
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So that's what we've done.

109
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Back in 1993 when the movie came out,

110
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation

111
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,

112
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we chose the dinosaur on the left,

113
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.

114
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And one of my former doctoral students,

115
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Dr. Mary Schweitzer,

116
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
actually had the background

117
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to do this sort of thing.

118
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,

119
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
one of the thigh bones,

120
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and she actually found

121
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
some very interesting structures in there.

122
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They found these red circular-looking objects,

123
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they looked, for all the world,

124
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
like red blood cells.

125
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And they're in

126
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
what appear to be the blood channels

127
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that go through the bone.

128
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so she thought, well, what the heck.

129
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So she sampled some material out of it.

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.

131
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But she did find heme,

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
which is the biological foundation

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of hemoglobin.

134
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And that was really cool.

135
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
That was interesting.

136
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.

137
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well we tried and tried

138
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.

139
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So a few years went by,

140
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and then we started the Hell Creek Project.

141
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking

142
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,

143
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and hopefully find some dinosaurs

144
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that had more material in them.

145
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And out in eastern Montana

146
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,

147
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and not very many people,

148
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.

149
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And we did find a lot of stuff.

150
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,

151
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but we found one special Tyrannosaur,

152
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we called it B-rex.

153
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And B-rex was found

154
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
under a thousand cubic yards of rock.

155
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It wasn't a very complete T. rex,

156
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it wasn't a very big T. rex,

157
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but it was a very special B-rex.

158
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I and my colleagues cut into it,

159
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we were able to determine,

160
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,

161
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that B-rex had died at the age of 16.

162
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,

163
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because we haven't found the oldest one yet.

164
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But this one died at the age of 16.

165
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,

166
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and she was actually able to determine

167
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that B-rex was a female

168
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
based on medullary tissue

169
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
found on the inside of the bone.

170
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,

171
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the calcium storage basically,

172
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
when an animal is pregnant,

173
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
when a bird is pregnant.

174
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So here was the character

175
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that linked birds and dinosaurs.

176
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But Mary went further.

177
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.

178
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now we all know that bones are fossilized,

179
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and so if you dump it into acid,

180
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
there shouldn't be anything left.

181
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But there was something left.

182
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There were blood vessels left.

183
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.

184
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.

185
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It was extraordinary.

186
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But she also found osteocytes,

187
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
which are the cells that laid down the bones.

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And try and try, we could not find DNA,

189
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but she did find evidence of proteins.

190
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But we thought maybe --

191
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
well, we thought maybe

192
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.

193
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And so we built a laboratory

195
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,

196
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and actually took the laboratory to the field

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
where we could get better samples.

198
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we did. We got better material.

199
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The cells looked better.

200
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The vessels looked better.

201
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Found the protein collagen.

202
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.

203
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But it's not dinosaur DNA.

204
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So we have discovered

205
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,

206
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
just breaks down too fast.

207
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We're just not going to be able

208
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."

209
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur

210
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
based on a dinosaur.

211
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But birds are dinosaurs.

212
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Birds are living dinosaurs.

213
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We actually classify them

214
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
as dinosaurs.

215
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs

216
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and avian dinosaurs.

217
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So the non-avian dinosaurs

218
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
are the big clunky ones that went extinct.

219
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.

220
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So we don't have to make a dinosaur

221
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because we already have them.

222
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.

224
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."

226
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
"You can call it a dinosaur,

228
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."

229
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"The chicken is not."

231
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So this is our problem,

233
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
as you can imagine.

234
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The chicken is a dinosaur.

235
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I mean it really is.

236
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You can't argue with it

237
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.

238
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Applause)

240
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But the sixth-graders demand it.

241
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Fix the chicken."

242
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

243
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So that's what I'm here to tell you about:

244
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
how we are going to fix a chicken.

245
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So we have a number of ways

246
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
that we actually can fix the chicken.

247
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Because evolution works,

248
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we actually have some evolutionary tools.

249
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We'll call them biological modification tools.

250
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We have selection.

251
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And we know selection works.

252
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We started out with a wolf-like creature

253
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and we ended up with a Maltese.

254
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I mean, that's --

255
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that's definitely genetic modification.

256
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.

257
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We also have transgenesis.

258
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Transgenesis is really cool too.

259
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.

260
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That's how people make GloFish.

261
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You take a glow gene

262
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
out of a coral or a jellyfish

263
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and you stick it in a zebrafish,

264
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and, puff, they glow.

265
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And that's pretty cool.

266
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.

267
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And now they're making Glow-rabbits

268
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.

269
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I guess we could make a glow chicken.

270
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.

272
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But there's another thing.

273
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
There's what we call atavism activation.

274
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And atavism activation

275
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is basically --

276
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.

277
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You heard

278
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that occasionally children are born with tails,

279
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.

280
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And so there are a number of atavisms

281
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that can happen.

282
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.

283
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And here's an example.

284
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This is a chicken with teeth.

285
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris

286
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison

287
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
actually figured out a way to stimulate

288
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the gene for teeth,

289
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on

290
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and produce teeth in chickens.

291
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now that's a good characteristic.

292
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We can save that one.

293
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We know we can use that.

294
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We can make a chicken with teeth.

295
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
That's getting closer.

296
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
That's better than a glowing chicken.

297
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

298
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,

299
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,

300
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is actually looking at atavisms.

301
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And he's looking at them

302
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
by looking at the embryo genesis of birds

303
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and actually looking at how they develop,

304
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.

305
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
He's also interested in the transformation

306
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
of the arm, the hand, to the wing.

307
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
He's looking for those genes as well.

308
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I said, "Well, if you can find those,

309
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I can just reverse them

310
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."

311
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And so he agreed.

312
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And so that's what we're looking into.

313
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
If you look at dinosaur hands,

314
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a velociraptor

315
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.

316
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,

317
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
still has that very primitive hand.

318
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But as you can see, the pigeon,

319
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
or a chicken or anything else, another bird,

320
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
has kind of a weird-looking hand,

321
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because the hand is a wing.

322
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But the cool thing is

323
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that, if you look in the embryo,

324
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as the embryo is developing

325
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the hand actually looks

326
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.

327
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It has the three fingers, the three digits.

328
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.

329
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And so what we're looking for is that gene.

330
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We want to stop that gene from turning on,

331
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
fusing those hands together,

332
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,

333
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
like the archaeopteryx.

334
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And the same goes for the tails.

335
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Birds have basically

336
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
rudimentary tails.

337
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And so we know

338
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that in embryo,

339
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as the animal is developing,

340
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
it actually has a relatively long tail.

341
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But a gene turns on

342
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.

343
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So that's the other gene we're looking for.

344
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.

345
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So what we're trying to do really

346
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is take our chicken,

347
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
modify it

348
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and make the chickenosaurus.

349
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

350
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's a cooler-looking chicken.

351
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But it's just the very basics.

352
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So that really is what we're doing.

353
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And people always say, "Why do that?

354
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Why make this thing?

355
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
What good is it?"

356
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Well, that's a good question.

357
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids

358
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
about evolutionary biology

359
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and developmental biology

360
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and all sorts of things.

361
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And quite frankly, I think

362
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
if Colonel Sanders

363
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
was to be careful how he worded it,

364
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
he could actually advertise an extra piece.

365
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

366
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Anyway --

367
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
When our dino-chicken hatches,

368
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
it will be, obviously, the poster child,

369
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
or what you might call a poster chick,

370
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
for technology, entertainment and design.

371
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Thank you.

372
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

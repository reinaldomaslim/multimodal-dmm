1
0:00:12.9,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The last time I heard my son's voice

2
0:00:15.42,000 --> 0:00:17,000
was when he walked out the front door

3
0:00:17.78,000 --> 0:00:18,000
on his way to school.

4
0:00:20.3,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He called out one word in the darkness:

5
0:00:23.14,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Bye."

6
0:00:24.82,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It was April 20, 1999.

7
0:00:28.7,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Later that morning, at Columbine High School,

8
0:00:31.78,000 --> 0:00:33,000
my son Dylan and his friend Eric

9
0:00:34.74,000 --> 0:00:36,000
killed 12 students and a teacher

10
0:00:38.1,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives.

11
0:00:42.98,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Thirteen innocent people were killed,

12
0:00:46.06,000 --> 0:00:49,000
leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma.

13
0:00:50.14,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Others sustained injuries,

14
0:00:52.02,000 --> 0:00:56,000
some resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability.

15
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But the enormity of the tragedy

16
0:00:59.5,000 --> 0:01:03,000
can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place.

17
0:01:04.54,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There's no way to quantify the psychological damage

18
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of those who were in the school,

19
0:01:09.94,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts.

20
0:01:14.1,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,

21
0:01:18.5,000 --> 0:01:2,000
especially when it can be a blueprint

22
0:01:20.78,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own.

23
0:01:25.42,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Columbine was a tidal wave,

24
0:01:28.02,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and when the crash ended,

25
0:01:29.3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it would take years for the community and for society

26
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to comprehend its impact.

27
0:01:36.54,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy.

28
0:01:41.58,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life

29
0:01:44.74,000 --> 0:01:47,000
showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew.

30
0:01:49.42,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Afterwards people asked,

31
0:01:51.82,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"How could you not know?

32
0:01:54.38,000 --> 0:01:55,000
What kind of a mother were you?"

33
0:01:57.06,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I still ask myself those same questions.

34
0:02:00.9,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Before the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom.

35
0:02:04.58,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Helping my children become caring,

36
0:02:07.06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
healthy, responsible adults

37
0:02:09.42,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was the most important role of my life.

38
0:02:13.58,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent,

39
0:02:17.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today.

40
0:02:23.06,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Aside from his father,

41
0:02:24.34,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most.

42
0:02:28.62,000 --> 0:02:3,000
If anyone could have known what was happening,

43
0:02:30.9,000 --> 0:02:31,000
it should have been me, right?

44
0:02:33.82,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But I didn't know.

45
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Today, I'm here to share the experience

46
0:02:39.18,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts.

47
0:02:44.02,000 --> 0:02:47,000
For years after the tragedy, I combed through memories,

48
0:02:47.9,000 --> 0:02:5,000
trying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent.

49
0:02:52.1,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But there are no simple answers.

50
0:02:54.86,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I can't give you any solutions.

51
0:02:57.34,000 --> 0:02:58,000
All I can do

52
0:02:59.58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is share what I have learned.

53
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings,

54
0:03:06.9,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I have three challenges to meet.

55
0:03:09.46,000 --> 0:03:12,000
First, when I walk into a room like this,

56
0:03:13.3,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I never know if someone there has experienced loss

57
0:03:16.9,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because of what my son did.

58
0:03:19.9,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family

59
0:03:24.06,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who isn't here to do it for himself.

60
0:03:26.9,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So first, with all of my heart,

61
0:03:30.14,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.

62
0:03:35.46,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The second challenge I have

63
0:03:37.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion

64
0:03:42.38,000 --> 0:03:45,000
when I talk about my son's death as a suicide.

65
0:03:46.3,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Two years before he died,

66
0:03:48.46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook

67
0:03:50.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that he was cutting himself.

68
0:03:53.02,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He said that he was in agony

69
0:03:54.66,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life.

70
0:03:57.98,000 --> 0:04:,000
I didn't know about any of this until months after his death.

71
0:04:02.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
When I talk about his death as a suicide,

72
0:04:05.98,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life.

73
0:04:10.66,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I'm trying to understand

74
0:04:12.66,000 --> 0:04:14,000
how his suicidal thinking

75
0:04:14.78,000 --> 0:04:15,000
led to murder.

76
0:04:16.9,000 --> 0:04:19,000
After a lot of reading and talking with experts,

77
0:04:20.14,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I have come to believe

78
0:04:21.82,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill

79
0:04:27.3,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but in his desire to die.

80
0:04:30.14,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The third challenge I have when I talk about my son's murder-suicide

81
0:04:35.46,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is that I'm talking about mental health --

82
0:04:39.5,000 --> 0:04:4,000
excuse me --

83
0:04:40.74,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is that I'm talking about mental health,

84
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or brain health, as I prefer to call it, because it's more concrete.

85
0:04:47.58,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And in the same breath, I'm talking about violence.

86
0:04:51.34,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding

87
0:04:54.94,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that already exists around mental illness.

88
0:04:58.18,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness

89
0:05:02.98,000 --> 0:05:04,000
are violent toward other people,

90
0:05:06.62,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but of those who die by suicide,

91
0:05:09.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent

92
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:17,000
have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind.

93
0:05:18.5,000 --> 0:05:19,000
As you all know very well,

94
0:05:19.78,000 --> 0:05:21,000
our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone,

95
0:05:23.82,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and not everyone with destructive thoughts

96
0:05:26.34,000 --> 0:05:27,000
fits the criteria

97
0:05:28.1,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for a specific diagnosis.

98
0:05:31.02,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Many who have ongoing feelings

99
0:05:33.06,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of fear or anger or hopelessness

100
0:05:36.82,000 --> 0:05:37,000
are never assessed or treated.

101
0:05:39.46,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Too often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis.

102
0:05:45.22,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If estimates are correct

103
0:05:47.3,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that about one to two percent of all suicides

104
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
involves the murder of another person,

105
0:05:53.9,000 --> 0:05:56,000
when suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations,

106
0:05:58.54,000 --> 0:06:,000
the murder-suicide rates will rise as well.

107
0:06:02.34,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I wanted to understand what was going on in Dylan's mind prior to his death,

108
0:06:07.86,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss.

109
0:06:13.46,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events,

110
0:06:18.02,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and whenever I could,

111
0:06:19.82,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis

112
0:06:24.34,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or attempt.

113
0:06:26.66,000 --> 0:06:28,000
One of the most helpful conversations I had

114
0:06:28.9,000 --> 0:06:29,000
was with a coworker

115
0:06:30.38,000 --> 0:06:31,000
who overheard me talking to someone else

116
0:06:32.309,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in my office cubicle.

117
0:06:34.58,000 --> 0:06:37,000
She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me

118
0:06:38.02,000 --> 0:06:4,000
if he could do something as horrible as he did.

119
0:06:41.82,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Later, when she found me alone,

120
0:06:44.58,000 --> 0:06:46,000
she apologized for overhearing that conversation,

121
0:06:47.06,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but told me that I was wrong.

122
0:06:49.7,000 --> 0:06:51,000
She said that when she was a young, single mother

123
0:06:52.34,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with three small children,

124
0:06:54.42,000 --> 0:06:58,000
she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe.

125
0:06:59.82,000 --> 0:07:01,000
At the time, she was certain

126
0:07:02.14,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that her children would be better off if she died,

127
0:07:05.42,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so she had made a plan to end her life.

128
0:07:08.7,000 --> 0:07:12,000
She assured me that a mother's love was the strongest bond on Earth,

129
0:07:12.78,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and that she loved her children more than anything in the world,

130
0:07:16.46,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but because of her illness,

131
0:07:18.7,000 --> 0:07:2,000
she was sure that they would be better off without her.

132
0:07:23.5,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What she said and what I've learned from others

133
0:07:25.9,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that we do not make the so-called decision or choice

134
0:07:30.66,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to die by suicide

135
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in the same way that we choose what car to drive

136
0:07:35.14,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or where to go on a Saturday night.

137
0:07:38.18,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When someone is in an extremely suicidal state,

138
0:07:41.3,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they are in a stage four medical health emergency.

139
0:07:46.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Their thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance.

140
0:07:52.14,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Even though they can make a plan and act with logic,

141
0:07:55.34,000 --> 0:07:58,000
their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain

142
0:07:59.3,000 --> 0:08:01,000
through which they interpret their reality.

143
0:08:02.7,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Some people can be very good at hiding this state,

144
0:08:06.38,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and they often have good reasons for doing that.

145
0:08:10.66,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point,

146
0:08:13.86,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide

147
0:08:17.38,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and devising a means to die

148
0:08:19.62,000 --> 0:08:21,000
are symptoms of pathology,

149
0:08:21.98,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and like many illnesses,

150
0:08:23.9,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the condition has to be recognized and treated

151
0:08:27.34,000 --> 0:08:28,000
before a life is lost.

152
0:08:30.42,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But my son's death was not purely a suicide.

153
0:08:34.02,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It involved mass murder.

154
0:08:36.9,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal.

155
0:08:43.74,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But research is sparse and there are no simple answers.

156
0:08:48.06,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.

157
0:08:52.499,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,

158
0:08:58.94,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and that made him less likely to seek help from others.

159
0:09:03.7,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He had experienced triggering events at the school

160
0:09:07.18,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad.

161
0:09:13.98,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And he had a complicated friendship

162
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation,

163
0:09:21.62,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and who was seriously disturbed,

164
0:09:24.74,000 --> 0:09:25,000
controlling and homicidal.

165
0:09:28.1,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And on top of this period in his life

166
0:09:30.98,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of extreme vulnerability and fragility,

167
0:09:35.1,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Dylan found access to guns

168
0:09:37.5,000 --> 0:09:39,000
even though we'd never owned any in our home.

169
0:09:40.62,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,

170
0:09:45.86,000 --> 0:09:49,000
both legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge.

171
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later,

172
0:09:56.9,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it's still appallingly easy.

173
0:10:00.98,000 --> 0:10:02,000
What Dylan did that day broke my heart,

174
0:10:05.06,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and as trauma so often does,

175
0:10:06.94,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it took a toll on my body and on my mind.

176
0:10:11.18,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Two years after the shootings, I got breast cancer,

177
0:10:15.02,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and two years after that, I began to have mental health problems.

178
0:10:20.3,000 --> 0:10:23,000
On top of the constant, perpetual grief

179
0:10:23.74,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I was terrified that I would run into a family member

180
0:10:27.34,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of someone Dylan had killed,

181
0:10:29.42,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or be accosted by the press

182
0:10:31.82,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or by an angry citizen.

183
0:10:34.74,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I was afraid to turn on the news,

184
0:10:37.34,000 --> 0:10:41,000
afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person.

185
0:10:45.14,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I started having panic attacks.

186
0:10:49.06,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The first bout started four years after the shootings,

187
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
when I was getting ready for the depositions

188
0:10:55.82,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and would have to meet the victims' families face to face.

189
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The second round started six years after the shootings,

190
0:11:02.82,000 --> 0:11:05,000
when I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide

191
0:11:06.3,000 --> 0:11:08,000
for the first time at a conference.

192
0:11:09.34,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Both episodes lasted several weeks.

193
0:11:13.98,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The attacks happened everywhere:

194
0:11:16.14,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in the hardware store, in my office,

195
0:11:19.46,000 --> 0:11:21,000
or even while reading a book in bed.

196
0:11:22.42,000 --> 0:11:27,000
My mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror

197
0:11:27.5,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and no matter how I hard I tried

198
0:11:29.62,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to calm myself down or reason my way out of it,

199
0:11:33.7,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I couldn't do it.

200
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me,

201
0:11:39.74,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and then, being afraid of being afraid

202
0:11:42.34,000 --> 0:11:43,000
consumed all of my thoughts.

203
0:11:45.02,000 --> 0:11:46,000
That's when I learned firsthand

204
0:11:46.94,000 --> 0:11:48,000
what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind,

205
0:11:50.46,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and that's when I truly became a brain health advocate.

206
0:11:55.58,000 --> 0:11:57,000
With therapy and medication and self-care,

207
0:11:58.58,000 --> 0:11:59,000
life eventually returned

208
0:12:00.42,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances.

209
0:12:05.06,000 --> 0:12:07,000
When I looked back on all that had happened,

210
0:12:07.14,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I could see that my son's spiral into dysfunction

211
0:12:11.5,000 --> 0:12:14,000
probably occurred over a period of about two years,

212
0:12:15.02,000 --> 0:12:17,000
plenty of time to get him help,

213
0:12:18.1,000 --> 0:12:21,000
if only someone had known that he needed help

214
0:12:21.14,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and known what to do.

215
0:12:27.5,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Every time someone asks me,

216
0:12:30.1,000 --> 0:12:32,000
"How could you not have known?",

217
0:12:32.58,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it feels like a punch in the gut.

218
0:12:35.66,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt

219
0:12:40.22,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that no matter how much therapy I've had

220
0:12:42.74,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I will never fully eradicate.

221
0:12:45.7,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But here's something I've learned:

222
0:12:48.54,000 --> 0:12:49,000
if love were enough

223
0:12:50.42,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to stop someone who is suicidal

224
0:12:52.58,000 --> 0:12:53,000
from hurting themselves,

225
0:12:54.82,000 --> 0:12:56,000
suicides would hardly ever happen.

226
0:12:58.14,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But love is not enough,

227
0:13:01.06,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and suicide is prevalent.

228
0:13:03.5,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's the second leading cause of death

229
0:13:06.34,000 --> 0:13:08,000
for people age 10 to 34,

230
0:13:09.46,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and 15 percent of American youth

231
0:13:12.14,000 --> 0:13:14,000
report having made a suicide plan

232
0:13:14.9,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in the last year.

233
0:13:17.98,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can,

234
0:13:22.82,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we cannot know or control

235
0:13:25.66,000 --> 0:13:26,000
everything our loved ones think and feel,

236
0:13:28.58,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different,

237
0:13:32.38,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves

238
0:13:35.82,000 --> 0:13:36,000
or someone else,

239
0:13:37.9,000 --> 0:13:39,000
can cause us to miss

240
0:13:39.94,000 --> 0:13:4,000
what's hidden in plain sight.

241
0:13:43.66,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And if worst case scenarios do come to pass,

242
0:13:48.34,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we'll have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing

243
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or for not asking the right questions

244
0:13:54.98,000 --> 0:13:56,000
or not finding the right treatment.

245
0:13:59.06,000 --> 0:14:,000
We should always assume

246
0:14:00.34,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that someone we love may be suffering,

247
0:14:03.7,000 --> 0:14:05,000
regardless of what they say

248
0:14:06.34,000 --> 0:14:07,000
or how they act.

249
0:14:08.54,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We should listen with our whole being,

250
0:14:11.62,000 --> 0:14:12,000
without judgments,

251
0:14:13.5,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and without offering solutions.

252
0:14:19.18,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I know that I will live with this tragedy,

253
0:14:22.42,000 --> 0:14:23,000
with these multiple tragedies,

254
0:14:24.38,000 --> 0:14:25,000
for the rest of my life.

255
0:14:27.14,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I know that in the minds of many,

256
0:14:32.9,000 --> 0:14:35,000
what I lost can't compare to what the other families lost.

257
0:14:38.06,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier.

258
0:14:42.82,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I know there are even some who think I don't have the right to any pain,

259
0:14:48.22,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but only to a life of permanent penance.

260
0:14:53.62,000 --> 0:14:55,000
In the end what I know comes down to this:

261
0:14:57.14,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us

262
0:15:03.34,000 --> 0:15:04,000
may not be able to help,

263
0:15:06.66,000 --> 0:15:08,000
but for love's sake,

264
0:15:08.86,000 --> 0:15:1,000
we must never stop trying

265
0:15:11.06,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to know the unknowable.

266
0:15:13.38,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Thank you.

267
0:15:14.62,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

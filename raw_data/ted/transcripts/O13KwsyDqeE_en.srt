1
0:00:12.019,000 --> 0:00:17,000
so I want to start this talk by showing

2
0:00:15.36,000 --> 0:00:2,000
y'all a photo and it's a photo many of

3
0:00:17.609,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you have probably seen before so I want

4
0:00:21.029,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you all to take a moment and look at

5
0:00:23.55,000 --> 0:00:27,000
this photo and really reflect on some of

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the things that come to mind and what

7
0:00:28.349,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are some of those things those words now

8
0:00:32.07,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm going to ask you all to look at me

9
0:00:35.54,000 --> 0:00:39,000
what words come to mind when you look at

10
0:00:38.91,000 --> 0:00:44,000
me

11
0:00:39.739,000 --> 0:00:45,000
what separates that man up there from me

12
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the man in that photo is named David

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Kirby and it was taken in 1990 as he was

14
0:00:50.489,000 --> 0:00:53,000
dying from age-related illness and it

15
0:00:52.5,000 --> 0:00:57,000
was subsequently published in Life

16
0:00:54.09,000 --> 0:01:,000
Magazine the only real thing separating

17
0:00:57.989,000 --> 0:01:01,000
me from Kirby is about 30 years of

18
0:01:01.05,000 --> 0:01:04,000
medical advancements in the way that we

19
0:01:02.699,000 --> 0:01:09,000
treat HIV and AIDS

20
0:01:04.61,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so what I want to ask next is this if we

21
0:01:10.619,000 --> 0:01:14,000
have made such exponential progress in

22
0:01:13.02,000 --> 0:01:17,000
combating HIV why haven't our

23
0:01:15.42,000 --> 0:01:21,000
perceptions of those with the virus

24
0:01:17.189,000 --> 0:01:23,000
evolved alongside why does HIV elicit

25
0:01:21.479,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this reaction from us when it's so

26
0:01:23.31,000 --> 0:01:27,000
easily managed

27
0:01:25.009,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when did the stigmatization even occur

28
0:01:28.29,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and why hasn't it subsided and these are

29
0:01:34.02,000 --> 0:01:37,000
not easy questions to answer

30
0:01:35.79,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they're the congealing of so many

31
0:01:37.439,000 --> 0:01:41,000
different factors and ideas powerful

32
0:01:40.35,000 --> 0:01:44,000
images like this one of Kirby these were

33
0:01:42.39,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the faces of the AIDS crisis in the 80s

34
0:01:44.369,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and 90s and at the time the crisis had a

35
0:01:47.009,000 --> 0:01:51,000
very obvious impact on an already

36
0:01:49.32,000 --> 0:01:54,000
stigmatized group of people and that was

37
0:01:51.42,000 --> 0:01:56,000
gay men so what the general straight

38
0:01:54.509,000 --> 0:01:58,000
public saw was this very awful thing

39
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:02,000
happening to a group of people who were

40
0:01:59.07,000 --> 0:02:04,000
already on the fringes of society the

41
0:02:02.25,000 --> 0:02:06,000
media at the time began to use the two

42
0:02:04.17,000 --> 0:02:09,000
almost interchangeably gay and AIDS and

43
0:02:06.99,000 --> 0:02:1,000
at the 1984 Republican National

44
0:02:09.509,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Convention one of the speaker's joked

45
0:02:11.459,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that gays stood for

46
0:02:13.66,000 --> 0:02:19,000
got AIDS yet and that was the mindset of

47
0:02:16.93,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the time but as we started to understand

48
0:02:20.02,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the virus more and how it was

49
0:02:21.61,000 --> 0:02:27,000
transmitted we realized that that risk

50
0:02:24.04,000 --> 0:02:31,000
had increased its territory the highly

51
0:02:27.88,000 --> 0:02:32,000
profiled case of Ryan White in 1985 he

52
0:02:31.18,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was a 13 year old haemophiliac who had

53
0:02:33.22,000 --> 0:02:37,000
contracted HIV from a contaminated blood

54
0:02:35.71,000 --> 0:02:4,000
treatment and this marked the most

55
0:02:38.17,000 --> 0:02:43,000
profound shift in America's perception

56
0:02:40.81,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of HIV no longer was it restricted to

57
0:02:43.99,000 --> 0:02:48,000
these dark corners of society to queers

58
0:02:46.63,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and drug users but now is affecting

59
0:02:49.21,000 --> 0:02:54,000
people that society deemed worthy of

60
0:02:51.43,000 --> 0:02:57,000
their empathy to children but that

61
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
permeating fear and that perception it

62
0:02:57.67,000 --> 0:03:02,000
still lingers and I want to show of

63
0:03:00.31,000 --> 0:03:05,000
hands for these next few questions how

64
0:03:03.04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
many of you in here were aware that with

65
0:03:05.35,000 --> 0:03:1,000
treatment those with HIV not only fend

66
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:12,000
off AIDS completely but they live full

67
0:03:10.66,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and normal lives

68
0:03:13.62,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Dola educated how many of you are aware

69
0:03:17.77,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that with treatment those with HIV can

70
0:03:21.07,000 --> 0:03:3,000
reach an undetectable status and that

71
0:03:23.11,000 --> 0:03:33,000
makes them virtually uninfected and

72
0:03:30.97,000 --> 0:03:34,000
post-exposure treatments that are

73
0:03:33.34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
available that reduced the risk of

74
0:03:35.05,000 --> 0:03:41,000
transmission by over 90 percent these

75
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
are incredible advancements that we have

76
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:46,000
made in fighting HIV yet they have not

77
0:03:44.65,000 --> 0:03:48,000
managed to dent the perception that most

78
0:03:47.05,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Americans have of the virus and those

79
0:03:48.88,000 --> 0:03:54,000
living with it and I don't want you to

80
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
think I'm downplaying the danger of this

81
0:03:55.63,000 --> 0:04:,000
virus and I am not ignorant of the

82
0:03:57.88,000 --> 0:04:01,000
harrowing past of the AIDS epidemic I am

83
0:04:01.09,000 --> 0:04:05,000
trying to convey that there is hope for

84
0:04:02.41,000 --> 0:04:08,000
those infected and HIV is not the death

85
0:04:05.2,000 --> 0:04:1,000
sentence it was in the 80s and now you

86
0:04:08.77,000 --> 0:04:12,000
may ask and I ask this question myself

87
0:04:10.36,000 --> 0:04:15,000
initially where are the stories where

88
0:04:13.63,000 --> 0:04:17,000
are these people living with HIV why

89
0:04:15.52,000 --> 0:04:19,000
haven't they been vocal how can I

90
0:04:17.89,000 --> 0:04:22,000
believe these successes are these

91
0:04:20.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
statistics without seeing the successes

92
0:04:23.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and this is actually a very easy

93
0:04:25.96,000 --> 0:04:31,000
question for me

94
0:04:27.139,000 --> 0:04:34,000
answer fear stigma and shame these keep

95
0:04:32.509,000 --> 0:04:37,000
those living with HIV in the closet so

96
0:04:35.09,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to speak our sexual histories are as

97
0:04:37.819,000 --> 0:04:4,000
personal to us as our medical histories

98
0:04:39.74,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and when you overlap the two you can

99
0:04:41.719,000 --> 0:04:46,000
find yourself in a very sensitive space

100
0:04:43.81,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the fear of how others perceive us when

101
0:04:46.759,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we're honest keeps us from doing many

102
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:53,000
things in life and this is the case for

103
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the hiv-positive population to face

104
0:04:53.93,000 --> 0:04:58,000
social scrutiny and ridicule is the

105
0:04:56.539,000 --> 0:05:01,000
price that we pay for transparency and

106
0:04:59.379,000 --> 0:05:04,000
why I become a martyr when you can

107
0:05:02.18,000 --> 0:05:06,000
effectively pass as someone without HIV

108
0:05:04.43,000 --> 0:05:08,000
after all there are no physical

109
0:05:06.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
indications you have the virus there's

110
0:05:08.99,000 --> 0:05:14,000
no sign that you where there is safety

111
0:05:12.979,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in assimilation and there is safety in

112
0:05:15.62,000 --> 0:05:23,000
invisibility I'm here to throw back that

113
0:05:20.06,000 --> 0:05:26,000
veil and share my story so in the fall

114
0:05:24.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of 2014 I was a sophomore in college

115
0:05:26.87,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and like most college students I was

116
0:05:29.449,000 --> 0:05:33,000
sexually active and I generally took

117
0:05:31.879,000 --> 0:05:35,000
precautions to minimize the risk that

118
0:05:33.86,000 --> 0:05:39,000
sex carries now I say generally because

119
0:05:36.77,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I wasn't always safe it only takes a

120
0:05:40.009,000 --> 0:05:43,000
single misstep before we're flat on the

121
0:05:41.75,000 --> 0:05:45,000
ground and my misstep is pretty obvious

122
0:05:43.969,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I had unprotected sex and I didn't think

123
0:05:46.639,000 --> 0:05:51,000
much of it fast forward about three

124
0:05:49.31,000 --> 0:05:54,000
weeks and it felt like I'd been trampled

125
0:05:52.279,000 --> 0:05:56,000
by a herd of wildebeest the aches in my

126
0:05:55.069,000 --> 0:06:,000
body were like nothing I have felt

127
0:05:56.75,000 --> 0:06:02,000
before or since I'll get these bouts of

128
0:06:00.139,000 --> 0:06:05,000
fever and chill I would real with nausea

129
0:06:02.9,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it was difficult to walk being a

130
0:06:05.87,000 --> 0:06:09,000
biology student I had some prior

131
0:06:07.879,000 --> 0:06:11,000
exposure to disease and being a fairly

132
0:06:10.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
informed gay man I had read a bit on HIV

133
0:06:12.71,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so to me it clicked that this was

134
0:06:15.229,000 --> 0:06:19,000
seroconversion or is it sometimes called

135
0:06:17.659,000 --> 0:06:21,000
acute HIV infection and this is the

136
0:06:20.15,000 --> 0:06:25,000
body's reaction in producing antibodies

137
0:06:22.099,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to the HIV antigen it's important to

138
0:06:25.49,000 --> 0:06:29,000
note that not everybody goes through

139
0:06:27.169,000 --> 0:06:31,000
this phase of sickness but I was one of

140
0:06:29.539,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the lucky ones who did and I was lucky

141
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
as then there were these physical

142
0:06:34.039,000 --> 0:06:39,000
symptoms that let me know hey something

143
0:06:36.589,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is wrong and it let me detect the virus

144
0:06:39.349,000 --> 0:06:44,000
prettier

145
0:06:40.58,000 --> 0:06:46,000
so just to clarify just to hit the nail

146
0:06:44.94,000 --> 0:06:48,000
on the head I got tested on campus and

147
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they called me or they said they would

148
0:06:49.47,000 --> 0:06:52,000
call me the next morning with the

149
0:06:50.58,000 --> 0:06:53,000
results and they called me

150
0:06:52.86,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but they asked me to come in and speak

151
0:06:54.54,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to the doctor on staff and the reaction

152
0:06:57.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
I received from her wasn't what I was

153
0:06:59.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
expecting

154
0:07:00.8,000 --> 0:07:04,000
she reassured me of what I already knew

155
0:07:03.06,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that this wasn't a death sentence and

156
0:07:05.07,000 --> 0:07:08,000
she even offered to put me in contact

157
0:07:06.81,000 --> 0:07:11,000
with her brother who had been living

158
0:07:08.49,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with HIV since the early 90s I declined

159
0:07:12.42,000 --> 0:07:17,000
her offer but I was deeply touched I was

160
0:07:15.66,000 --> 0:07:19,000
expecting to be reprimanded I was

161
0:07:17.67,000 --> 0:07:22,000
expecting pity and disappointment and I

162
0:07:20.49,000 --> 0:07:24,000
was shown compassion and human warmth

163
0:07:23.22,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I'm forever grateful for that first

164
0:07:25.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
exchange so obviously for a few weeks I

165
0:07:29.94,000 --> 0:07:34,000
was a physical mess emotionally mentally

166
0:07:33.36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I was doing okay I was taking it well

167
0:07:35.88,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but my body was ravaged and those close

168
0:07:39.21,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to me they weren't oblivious so I sat my

169
0:07:43.02,000 --> 0:07:47,000
roommates down and I let them know I'd

170
0:07:44.94,000 --> 0:07:48,000
been diagnosed with HIV that I was about

171
0:07:47.7,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to receive treatment and I didn't want

172
0:07:49.35,000 --> 0:07:54,000
them to worry and I remember the look on

173
0:07:52.62,000 --> 0:07:56,000
their faces they were holding each other

174
0:07:55.14,000 --> 0:07:59,000
on the couch and they were crying and I

175
0:07:57.2,000 --> 0:08:03,000
consoled them I consoled them about my

176
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:06,000
own bad news but it was heartwarming to

177
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
see that they cared but from that night

178
0:08:06.99,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I noticed a shift in the way that I was

179
0:08:09.6,000 --> 0:08:13,000
treated at home my roommates wouldn't

180
0:08:12.06,000 --> 0:08:18,000
touch anything of mine and they wouldn't

181
0:08:14.28,000 --> 0:08:2,000
eat anything I had cooked now in South

182
0:08:18.57,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Louisiana we all know that you don't

183
0:08:20.49,000 --> 0:08:26,000
refuse food and I'm a damn good cook so

184
0:08:23.88,000 --> 0:08:26,000
don't think that passed me by

185
0:08:27.289,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but from these first silent hints there

186
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:35,000
their version got gradually more obvious

187
0:08:32.25,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and more offensive I was asked to move

188
0:08:35.909,000 --> 0:08:4,000
my toothbrush from the bathroom I was

189
0:08:38.49,000 --> 0:08:42,000
asked to not share towels and I was even

190
0:08:41.459,000 --> 0:08:45,000
asked to wash my clothes on a hotter

191
0:08:43.11,000 --> 0:08:49,000
setting this wasn't headlights y'all

192
0:08:46.23,000 --> 0:08:51,000
this wasn't scabies this was HIV it can

193
0:08:49.11,000 --> 0:08:53,000
be transmitted through blood sexual

194
0:08:51.72,000 --> 0:08:56,000
fluids like semen or vaginal fluids and

195
0:08:54.089,000 --> 0:08:58,000
breast milk since I wasn't sleeping with

196
0:08:57.029,000 --> 0:09:01,000
my roommates

197
0:08:58.11,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I wasn't breastfeeding them and we

198
0:09:01.589,000 --> 0:09:07,000
weren't reenacting Twilight I was of no

199
0:09:04.35,000 --> 0:09:09,000
risk to them and and I made this aware

200
0:09:07.709,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to them but still this discomfort it

201
0:09:10.17,000 --> 0:09:14,000
continued until eventually I was asked

202
0:09:12.51,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to move out and I was asked him about

203
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because one of my roommates had shared

204
0:09:17.459,000 --> 0:09:22,000
my status with her parents she shared my

205
0:09:21.269,000 --> 0:09:26,000
personal medical information to

206
0:09:23.37,000 --> 0:09:28,000
strangers and now I'm doing that in a

207
0:09:26.399,000 --> 0:09:3,000
room full of 300 of y'all but at the

208
0:09:29.1,000 --> 0:09:32,000
time this was not something I was

209
0:09:30.75,000 --> 0:09:33,000
comfortable with and they expressed

210
0:09:32.88,000 --> 0:09:37,000
their discomfort with their daughter

211
0:09:34.709,000 --> 0:09:39,000
living with me so being gay raised in a

212
0:09:38.61,000 --> 0:09:42,000
religious household and living in the

213
0:09:40.589,000 --> 0:09:46,000
south discrimination wasn't new to me

214
0:09:43.07,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but this form was and it was

215
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:51,000
tremendously disappointing because it

216
0:09:48.66,000 --> 0:09:54,000
came from such an unlikely source not

217
0:09:52.41,000 --> 0:09:56,000
only were these college-educated people

218
0:09:54.8,000 --> 0:09:59,000
not only were they other members of the

219
0:09:57.3,000 --> 0:10:04,000
LGBT community but they were also my

220
0:10:00.51,000 --> 0:10:06,000
friends so I did I moved out at the end

221
0:10:04.769,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of the semester but it wasn't to appease

222
0:10:06.99,000 --> 0:10:11,000
them it was out of respect for myself I

223
0:10:09.89,000 --> 0:10:13,000
wasn't going to subject myself to people

224
0:10:12.51,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who were unwilling to remedy their

225
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
ignorant and I wasn't gonna let

226
0:10:16.649,000 --> 0:10:2,000
something that was now a part of me ever

227
0:10:18.54,000 --> 0:10:23,000
be used as a tool against me

228
0:10:20.79,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so I opted for transparency about my

229
0:10:24.48,000 --> 0:10:29,000
status always being visible and this is

230
0:10:28.47,000 --> 0:10:32,000
what I like to call being the everyday

231
0:10:29.85,000 --> 0:10:34,000
advocate the point of this transparency

232
0:10:32.579,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the point of this everyday advocacy was

233
0:10:35.61,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to dispel ignorant and ignorance is a

234
0:10:38.339,000 --> 0:10:42,000
very scary word

235
0:10:40.2,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we don't want to be seen as ignorant and

236
0:10:43.019,000 --> 0:10:47,000
we definitely don't want to be called it

237
0:10:44.91,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but ignorant is not synonymous with

238
0:10:47.25,000 --> 0:10:52,000
stupid it's not the inability to learn

239
0:10:50.22,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's the state you're in

240
0:10:52.35,000 --> 0:10:57,000
before you learn so when I saw someone

241
0:10:55.2,000 --> 0:11:,000
coming from a place of ignorance I saw

242
0:10:57.99,000 --> 0:11:01,000
an opportunity for them to learn and

243
0:11:00.529,000 --> 0:11:03,000
hopefully if I could spread some

244
0:11:02.639,000 --> 0:11:06,000
education than I could mitigate

245
0:11:04.47,000 --> 0:11:08,000
situations for others like I had

246
0:11:06.69,000 --> 0:11:09,000
experience with my roommates and save

247
0:11:08.579,000 --> 0:11:13,000
someone else down the line that

248
0:11:10.23,000 --> 0:11:18,000
humiliation so the reactions I received

249
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:2,000
haven't been all positive here in the

250
0:11:18.6,000 --> 0:11:22,000
South we have a lot of stigma due to

251
0:11:20.55,000 --> 0:11:25,000
religious pressures our lack of a

252
0:11:23.1,000 --> 0:11:27,000
comprehensive sex education and our

253
0:11:25.649,000 --> 0:11:3,000
general conservative outlook on anything

254
0:11:27.839,000 --> 0:11:33,000
sexual we view this as a gay disease

255
0:11:31.22,000 --> 0:11:36,000
globally most new HIV infections occur

256
0:11:34.019,000 --> 0:11:38,000
between heterosexual partners and here

257
0:11:36.72,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in the states women especially women of

258
0:11:38.519,000 --> 0:11:43,000
color are at an increased risk this is

259
0:11:41.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
not a gay disease it never has been it's

260
0:11:44.07,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a disease we should all be concerned

261
0:11:45.39,000 --> 0:11:52,000
with so initially I felt limited I

262
0:11:50.399,000 --> 0:11:57,000
wanted to expand my scope and reach

263
0:11:52.949,000 --> 0:11:59,000
beyond what was around me so naturally I

264
0:11:57.74,000 --> 0:12:03,000
turned to the dark underworld of online

265
0:12:00.839,000 --> 0:12:05,000
dating ads to apps like Grindr and for

266
0:12:04.56,000 --> 0:12:07,000
those of you who are unfamiliar these

267
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
are dating apps targeted towards gay men

268
0:12:07.829,000 --> 0:12:1,000
you can upload a profile in a picture

269
0:12:10.14,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and it'll show you available guys within

270
0:12:11.699,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a radius y'all have probably heard of

271
0:12:14.37,000 --> 0:12:18,000
tinder grinder has been around for a lot

272
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:2,000
longer since it was much harder to meet

273
0:12:18.779,000 --> 0:12:23,000
your future gay husband at church or the

274
0:12:21.48,000 --> 0:12:24,000
grocery store or what whatever straight

275
0:12:23.94,000 --> 0:12:28,000
people did before they found out they

276
0:12:25.47,000 --> 0:12:31,000
could date on their phones so unkind ER

277
0:12:29.43,000 --> 0:12:32,000
if you liked what you saw or read you

278
0:12:31.529,000 --> 0:12:36,000
could send someone a message you can

279
0:12:32.85,000 --> 0:12:38,000
meet up you can do other things so on my

280
0:12:36.99,000 --> 0:12:38,000
profile I obviously stated that I had

281
0:12:38.97,000 --> 0:12:4,000
HIV

282
0:12:39.48,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I was undetectable and I welcomed

283
0:12:41.73,000 --> 0:12:46,000
questions about my status and I received

284
0:12:44.94,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a lot of questions and a lot of comments

285
0:12:46.889,000 --> 0:12:51,000
both positive and negative and I want to

286
0:12:50.399,000 --> 0:12:53,000
start with the negative just to frame

287
0:12:52.649,000 --> 0:12:55,000
some of this ignorant

288
0:12:53.699,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that I've mentioned before and most of

289
0:12:56.519,000 --> 0:13:,000
these negative comments were passing

290
0:12:58.739,000 --> 0:13:02,000
remarks or assumptions they would assume

291
0:13:01.109,000 --> 0:13:05,000
things about my sex life or my sex

292
0:13:03.029,000 --> 0:13:08,000
habits they would assume I put myself or

293
0:13:05.549,000 --> 0:13:09,000
others at risk but very often I would

294
0:13:08.489,000 --> 0:13:13,000
just be met with these passing ignorant

295
0:13:10.35,000 --> 0:13:15,000
remarks in the gay community it's common

296
0:13:13.559,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to hear the word clean when you're

297
0:13:16.019,000 --> 0:13:2,000
referring to someone who's HIV negative

298
0:13:17.609,000 --> 0:13:22,000
of course the flip side to that is being

299
0:13:20.609,000 --> 0:13:25,000
unclean or dirty when you do have HIV

300
0:13:23.549,000 --> 0:13:28,000
now I'm not sensitive and I'm only truly

301
0:13:26.22,000 --> 0:13:32,000
dirty after a day in the field but this

302
0:13:29.489,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is damaging language this is a community

303
0:13:32.22,000 --> 0:13:36,000
driven stigma that keeps mini gay men

304
0:13:34.679,000 --> 0:13:38,000
from disclosing their status and it

305
0:13:37.079,000 --> 0:13:41,000
keeps those newly diagnosed from seeking

306
0:13:38.97,000 --> 0:13:42,000
support within their own community and I

307
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
find that truly distressing but

308
0:13:43.589,000 --> 0:13:47,000
thankfully the positive responses have

309
0:13:45.899,000 --> 0:13:49,000
been a lot more numerous and they came

310
0:13:47.819,000 --> 0:13:51,000
from guys who were curious and they were

311
0:13:49.949,000 --> 0:13:54,000
curious about the risks of transmission

312
0:13:52.23,000 --> 0:13:57,000
or what exactly undetectable meant or

313
0:13:54.989,000 --> 0:13:58,000
where they could get tested or some guys

314
0:13:57.629,000 --> 0:14:02,000
would ask me about my experiences and I

315
0:13:59.489,000 --> 0:14:04,000
could share my story with them but most

316
0:14:02.72,000 --> 0:14:06,000
importantly I would get approached by

317
0:14:05.189,000 --> 0:14:09,000
guys who were newly diagnosed with HIV

318
0:14:07.379,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and they were scared

319
0:14:09.449,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and they were alone and they didn't know

320
0:14:11.549,000 --> 0:14:15,000
what step to take next they didn't want

321
0:14:14.429,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to tell their family they didn't want to

322
0:14:16.169,000 --> 0:14:22,000
tell their friends and they felt damaged

323
0:14:18.209,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and they felt dirty and I did whatever I

324
0:14:22.41,000 --> 0:14:25,000
could to immediately calm them and then

325
0:14:24.839,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I would put them in contact with

326
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Acadiana cares which is a wonderful

327
0:14:28.139,000 --> 0:14:33,000
resource we have in our community for

328
0:14:30.899,000 --> 0:14:34,000
those with HIV and I put them in contact

329
0:14:33.569,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with people I knew personally so that

330
0:14:35.73,000 --> 0:14:38,000
they could not only have this safe space

331
0:14:37.769,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to feel human again

332
0:14:39.239,000 --> 0:14:42,000
but so they could also have the

333
0:14:40.949,000 --> 0:14:45,000
resources they needed in affording their

334
0:14:42.779,000 --> 0:14:48,000
treatment and this was by far the most

335
0:14:45.959,000 --> 0:14:51,000
humbling aspect of my transparency that

336
0:14:49.619,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I could have some positive impact on

337
0:14:52.919,000 --> 0:14:55,000
those those who are suffering like I did

338
0:14:54.959,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that I could help those who were in the

339
0:14:56.459,000 --> 0:15:,000
dark because I had been there and it

340
0:14:58.859,000 --> 0:15:01,000
wasn't a good place to be

341
0:15:00.48,000 --> 0:15:04,000
these guys came from all different

342
0:15:02.819,000 --> 0:15:05,000
backgrounds and many of them weren't as

343
0:15:04.949,000 --> 0:15:06,000
informed as I had been and they were

344
0:15:06.629,000 --> 0:15:1,000
coming to me

345
0:15:07.48,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a place of fear some of these people I

346
0:15:10.75,000 --> 0:15:15,000
knew personally are they knew of me but

347
0:15:13.449,000 --> 0:15:17,000
many more they were anonymous there were

348
0:15:15.91,000 --> 0:15:19,000
these blank profiles who were too afraid

349
0:15:18.04,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to show their faces after what they had

350
0:15:19.99,000 --> 0:15:24,000
told me and on the topic of transparency

351
0:15:23.56,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I want to leave Yale with a few thoughts

352
0:15:25.48,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I found that with whatever risk or

353
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
gamble I took in putting my face out

354
0:15:31.389,000 --> 0:15:36,000
there it was well worth any negative

355
0:15:34.12,000 --> 0:15:38,000
comment any flack I received because I

356
0:15:36.88,000 --> 0:15:41,000
felt I was able to make this real and

357
0:15:38.709,000 --> 0:15:44,000
this tangible impact and it showed me

358
0:15:42.339,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that our efforts resound that we can

359
0:15:45.1,000 --> 0:15:49,000
alter the lives that we encounter for

360
0:15:47.38,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the good and they in turn can take that

361
0:15:49.51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
momentum and push it even further and if

362
0:15:53.23,000 --> 0:15:56,000
any of you or anyone you know is dealing

363
0:15:55.36,000 --> 0:15:58,000
with HIV or if you want to see what

364
0:15:57.1,000 --> 0:16:01,000
resources you have in your community or

365
0:15:59.17,000 --> 0:16:03,000
just educate yourself more on the

366
0:16:01.389,000 --> 0:16:06,000
disease here are some wonderful national

367
0:16:03.94,000 --> 0:16:07,000
sites that you can access and you are

368
0:16:06.61,000 --> 0:16:09,000
more than welcome to find me after this

369
0:16:08.199,000 --> 0:16:13,000
talk and ask me anything you'd like

370
0:16:10.199,000 --> 0:16:16,000
we've all heard the phrase to see the

371
0:16:13.6,000 --> 0:16:18,000
forest through the trees so I'm for all

372
0:16:16.93,000 --> 0:16:2,000
of you here to really see the human

373
0:16:19.029,000 --> 0:16:25,000
through the disease it's a very easy

374
0:16:21.85,000 --> 0:16:27,000
thing to see numbers and statistics and

375
0:16:25.149,000 --> 0:16:31,000
only see the perceived dangers it's a

376
0:16:28.75,000 --> 0:16:34,000
much harder thing to see all the faces

377
0:16:31.3,000 --> 0:16:36,000
behind those numbers so when you find

378
0:16:35.079,000 --> 0:16:38,000
yourself thinking those things as words

379
0:16:37.209,000 --> 0:16:43,000
what you might have thought looking at

380
0:16:38.92,000 --> 0:16:47,000
David Kirby I asked you instead think

381
0:16:43.6,000 --> 0:16:52,000
son or think brother think front and

382
0:16:48.779,000 --> 0:16:54,000
most importantly think human seek

383
0:16:53.05,000 --> 0:16:58,000
education when faced with ignorance and

384
0:16:55.569,000 --> 0:17:02,000
always be mindful and always be

385
0:16:58.959,000 --> 0:17:01,000
compassionate thank you

1
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I used to have this recurring dream

2
0:00:14.929,000 --> 0:00:16,000
where I'd walk into a roomful of people,

3
0:00:18.388,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I'd try not to make eye contact with anyone.

4
0:00:22.22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Until someone notices me,

5
0:00:23.959,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I just panic.

6
0:00:26.213,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the person walks up to me,

7
0:00:28.041,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.

8
0:00:30.574,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And what is your name?"

9
0:00:32.313,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.

10
0:00:37.196,000 --> 0:00:39,000
After some awkward silence, he goes,

11
0:00:39.663,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Have you forgotten your name?"

12
0:00:41.851,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I'm still quiet.

13
0:00:44.293,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And then, slowly, all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me

14
0:00:48.963,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and ask, almost in unison,

15
0:00:51.83,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Voice-over, several voices) "Have you forgotten your name?"

16
0:00:56.616,000 --> 0:00:59,000
As the chant gets louder, I want to respond, but I don't.

17
0:01:02.35,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm a visual artist.

18
0:01:04.754,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Some of my work is humorous,

19
0:01:07.359,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And one thing that I really enjoy doing

21
0:01:16.891,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is making these little animations

22
0:01:19.181,000 --> 0:01:22,000
where I get to do the voice-over for all kinds of characters.

23
0:01:22.979,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I've been a bear.

24
0:01:24.261,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.

25
0:01:26.354,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:28.129,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.

27
0:01:29.813,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.

28
0:01:31.526,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:32.813,000 --> 0:01:33,000
SS: I've been a greeting card.

30
0:01:34.301,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.

31
0:01:36.378,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:37.481,000 --> 0:01:4,000
SS: And my personal favorite is Frankenstein's monster.

33
0:01:40.512,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Video) Frankenstein's monster (SS's voice): (Grunts)

34
0:01:43.233,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:44.297,000 --> 0:01:46,000
SS: I just had to grunt a lot for that one.

36
0:01:46.421,000 --> 0:01:48,000
A few years ago, I made this educational video

37
0:01:49.128,000 --> 0:01:51,000
about the history of video games.

38
0:01:52.048,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And for that one, I got to do the voice of Space Invader.

39
0:01:55.814,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.

40
0:01:57.894,000 --> 0:01:58,000
SS: A dream come true, really,

41
0:01:59.365,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:00.391,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And when that video was posted online,

43
0:02:02.494,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I just sat there on the computer, hitting "refresh,"

44
0:02:05.208,000 --> 0:02:06,000
excited to see the response.

45
0:02:07.208,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The first comment comes in.

46
0:02:08.646,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Video) Comment: Great job.

47
0:02:09.964,000 --> 0:02:1,000
SS: Yes!

48
0:02:11.709,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I hit "refresh."

49
0:02:12.988,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Video) Comment: Excellent video. I look forward to the next one.

50
0:02:16.115,000 --> 0:02:18,000
SS: This was just the first of a two-part video.

51
0:02:18.635,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was going to work on the second one next.

52
0:02:20.7,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I hit "refresh."

53
0:02:21.89,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO? WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P

54
0:02:25.75,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:27.292,000 --> 0:02:29,000
SS: People other than my mom were saying nice things about me,

56
0:02:30.259,000 --> 0:02:31,000
on the Internet!

57
0:02:31.449,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It felt like I had finally arrived.

58
0:02:33.806,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I hit "refresh."

59
0:02:35.132,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Video) Comment: His voice is annoying. No offense.

60
0:02:37.855,000 --> 0:02:39,000
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.

61
0:02:40.549,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Video) Comment: Could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth?

62
0:02:44.137,000 --> 0:02:48,000
SS: OK, at least the feedback is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."

63
0:02:48.628,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Video) Comment: Please don't use this narrator again

64
0:02:51.198,000 --> 0:02:52,000
u can barely understand him.

65
0:02:52.584,000 --> 0:02:53,000
SS: Refresh.

66
0:02:53.759,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow because of the Indian accent.

67
0:02:56.763,000 --> 0:02:57,000
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.

68
0:02:58.271,000 --> 0:03:,000
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,

69
0:03:00.367,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I have a Pakistani accent, OK?

70
0:03:02.318,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And number two, I clearly have a Pakistani accent.

71
0:03:05.482,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:08.233,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But comments like that kept coming in,

73
0:03:10.282,000 --> 0:03:12,000
so I figured I should just ignore them

74
0:03:13.051,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and start working on the second part of the video.

75
0:03:16.104,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I recorded my audio,

76
0:03:17.658,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but every time I sat down to edit,

77
0:03:20.681,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I just could not do it.

78
0:03:23.688,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Every single time, it would take me back to my childhood,

79
0:03:26.7,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when I had a much harder time speaking.

80
0:03:29.934,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I've stuttered for as long as I can remember.

81
0:03:34.285,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was the kid in class

82
0:03:35.586,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who would never raise his hand when he had a question --

83
0:03:38.247,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or knew the answer.

84
0:03:39.445,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Every time the phone rang,

85
0:03:40.784,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I would run to the bathroom so I would not have to answer it.

86
0:03:44.907,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.

87
0:03:48.14,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

88
0:03:51.721,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I hated introducing myself,

89
0:03:54.216,000 --> 0:03:55,000
especially in groups.

90
0:03:55.849,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'd always stutter on my name, and there was usually someone who'd go,

91
0:03:59.249,000 --> 0:04:,000
"Have you forgotten your name?"

92
0:04:00.8,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then everybody would laugh.

93
0:04:02.856,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That joke never got old.

94
0:04:06.727,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:09.635,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke,

96
0:04:13.466,000 --> 0:04:18,000
it would become obvious that there was something wrong with me,

97
0:04:18.645,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that I was not normal.

98
0:04:21.07,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So I mostly stayed quiet.

99
0:04:24.142,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work

100
0:04:27.929,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was a huge step for me.

101
0:04:29.991,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Every time I record audio,

102
0:04:31.611,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times,

103
0:04:35.13,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then I go back in

104
0:04:36.788,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and pick the ones where I think I suck the least.

105
0:04:42.997,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.

106
0:04:46.1,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.

107
0:04:49.935,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And if I stutter along the way, and if I stutter along the way,

108
0:04:53.706,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I just go back in and fix it.

109
0:04:55.349,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's magic.

110
0:04:56.768,000 --> 0:04:58,000
SS: Using my highly edited voice in my work

111
0:04:59.697,000 --> 0:05:02,000
was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself.

112
0:05:04.302,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But after the comments on the video,

113
0:05:06.924,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it no longer made me feel normal.

114
0:05:09.897,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so I stopped using my voice in my work.

115
0:05:13.984,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Since then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.

116
0:05:19.218,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I've come to understand

117
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that "normal" has a lot to do with expectations.

118
0:05:25.307,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Let me give you an example.

119
0:05:26.86,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I came across this story

120
0:05:28.214,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.

121
0:05:30.504,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, Homer mentions very few colors in his writing.

122
0:05:34.65,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And even when he does,

123
0:05:36.279,000 --> 0:05:38,000
he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.

124
0:05:38.936,000 --> 0:05:41,000
For example, the sea is described as wine red,

125
0:05:42.252,000 --> 0:05:45,000
people's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.

126
0:05:46.838,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But it's not just Homer.

127
0:05:48.237,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If you look at all of the ancient literature --

128
0:05:50.57,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian

129
0:05:52.794,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and even the original Hebrew Bible --

130
0:05:55.495,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they all mention very few colors.

131
0:05:58.745,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the most popular theory for why that might be the case

132
0:06:02.149,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is that cultures begin to recognize a color

133
0:06:04.577,000 --> 0:06:07,000
only once they have the ability to make that color.

134
0:06:07.686,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So basically, if you can make a color,

135
0:06:09.56,000 --> 0:06:1,000
only then can you see it.

136
0:06:11.727,000 --> 0:06:14,000
A color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make --

137
0:06:15.41,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they began to see that color fairly early on.

138
0:06:18.265,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But a color like blue, which was much harder to make --

139
0:06:21.032,000 --> 0:06:23,000
many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color

140
0:06:23.809,000 --> 0:06:24,000
until much later.

141
0:06:24.999,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.

142
0:06:27.539,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So until then, even though a color might be all around them,

143
0:06:31.213,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they simply did not have the ability to see it.

144
0:06:33.682,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It was invisIble.

145
0:06:34.864,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It was not a part of their normal.

146
0:06:38.593,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that story has helped put my own experience into context.

147
0:06:42.376,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So when I first read the comments on the video,

148
0:06:44.87,000 --> 0:06:46,000
my initial reaction was to take it all very personally.

149
0:06:48.543,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But the people commenting did not know

150
0:06:50.465,000 --> 0:06:52,000
how self-conscious I am about my voice.

151
0:06:54.258,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They were mostly reacting to my accent,

152
0:06:56.929,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent.

153
0:07:01.089,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But what is normal, anyway?

154
0:07:03.473,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We know that reviewers will find more spelling errors in your writing

155
0:07:06.859,000 --> 0:07:07,000
if they think you're black.

156
0:07:09.144,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students.

157
0:07:14.349,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And we know that resumes with white-sounding names

158
0:07:17.02,000 --> 0:07:19,000
get more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names.

159
0:07:21.043,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Why is that?

160
0:07:23.011,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Because of our expectations of what is normal.

161
0:07:26.135,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We think it is normal

162
0:07:27.738,000 --> 0:07:29,000
when a black student has spelling errors.

163
0:07:30.264,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We think it is normal

164
0:07:32.003,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when a female or minority student does not succeed.

165
0:07:35.962,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And we think it is normal

166
0:07:37.625,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee.

167
0:07:41.399,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But studies also show that discrimination of this kind,

168
0:07:44.017,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in most cases, is simply favoritism,

169
0:07:46.086,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to

170
0:07:50.493,000 --> 0:07:53,000
than the desire to harm people that you can't relate to.

171
0:07:54.944,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And not relating to people starts at a very early age.

172
0:07:58.175,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Let me give you an example.

173
0:07:59.949,000 --> 0:08:02,000
One library that keeps track of characters

174
0:08:03.522,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in the children's book collection every year,

175
0:08:06.839,000 --> 0:08:11,000
found that in 2014, only about 11 percent of the books

176
0:08:12.144,000 --> 0:08:14,000
had a character of color.

177
0:08:14.368,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And just the year before, that number was about eight percent,

178
0:08:18.069,000 --> 0:08:21,000
even though half of American children today come from a minority background.

179
0:08:21.901,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Half.

180
0:08:23.353,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So there are two big issues here.

181
0:08:25.001,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Number one, children are told that they can be anything,

182
0:08:27.682,000 --> 0:08:28,000
they can do anything,

183
0:08:28.857,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and yet, most stories that children of color consume

184
0:08:31.354,000 --> 0:08:32,000
are about people who are not like them.

185
0:08:33.256,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Number two is that majority groups don't get to realize

186
0:08:36.039,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the great extent to which they are similar to minorities --

187
0:08:39.096,000 --> 0:08:42,000
our everyday experiences, our hopes,

188
0:08:42.167,000 --> 0:08:43,000
our dreams, our fears

189
0:08:44.063,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and our mutual love for hummus.

190
0:08:45.86,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's delicious!

191
0:08:47.193,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:49.911,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Just like the color blue for Ancient Greeks,

193
0:08:52.618,000 --> 0:08:55,000
minorities are not a part of what we consider normal,

194
0:08:57.44,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because normal is simply a construction of what we've been exposed to,

195
0:09:02.425,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and how visible it is around us.

196
0:09:05.59,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And this is where things get a bit difficult.

197
0:09:08.714,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I can accept the preexisting notion of normal -- that normal is good,

198
0:09:13.018,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and anything outside of that very narrow definition of normal is bad.

199
0:09:17.758,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Or I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal

200
0:09:22.462,000 --> 0:09:23,000
with my work

201
0:09:24.034,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and with my voice

202
0:09:26.338,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and with my accent

203
0:09:28.632,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and by standing here onstage,

204
0:09:30.172,000 --> 0:09:33,000
even though I'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom.

205
0:09:33.519,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:34.86,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Applause)

207
0:09:45.301,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly starting to use my voice

208
0:09:48.496,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in my work again.

209
0:09:49.674,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And it feels good.

210
0:09:50.849,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown

211
0:09:52.841,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the next time a couple dozen people say that I talk

212
0:09:55.332,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Mumbling) like I have peanut butter in my mouth.

213
0:09:57.664,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:58.69,000 --> 0:10:,000
SS: It just means I now have a much better understanding

215
0:10:01.394,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of what's at stake,

216
0:10:03.162,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and how giving up is not an option.

217
0:10:08.519,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize

218
0:10:11.429,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that the sky was blue.

219
0:10:13.197,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring

220
0:10:16.659,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for so long.

221
0:10:18.893,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal,

222
0:10:22.738,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because doing so is going to allow us as a society

223
0:10:27.094,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to finally see the sky for what it is.

224
0:10:32.272,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

225
0:10:38.06,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)

226
0:10:39.675,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:40.71,000 --> 0:10:41,000
SS: Thank you.

228
0:10:41.885,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.827,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana

3
0:00:20.358,000 --> 0:00:22,000
had a very successful perfume business.

4
0:00:23.069,000 --> 0:00:25,000
For over 50 years she ran it.

5
0:00:25.326,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — (Laughter) —

6
0:00:28.111,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.

7
0:00:33.542,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,

8
0:00:37.408,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but as a poison, it was the best money could buy,

9
0:00:40.732,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.

10
0:00:44.525,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,

11
0:00:49.785,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.

12
0:00:53.954,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.

13
0:00:57.289,000 --> 0:01:,000
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.

14
0:01:00.553,000 --> 0:01:02,000
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops

15
0:01:03.124,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of a bitter substance or a sour substance,

16
0:01:05.687,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,

17
0:01:09.459,000 --> 0:01:11,000
as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.

18
0:01:12.331,000 --> 0:01:14,000
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes

19
0:01:15.283,000 --> 0:01:18,000
sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just

20
0:01:18.803,000 --> 0:01:2,000
about whether or not we're about to be poisoned,

21
0:01:21.255,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination

22
0:01:24.212,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.

23
0:01:28.343,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away

24
0:01:32.296,000 --> 0:01:34,000
from physical contaminants, and there's a growing

25
0:01:34.477,000 --> 0:01:37,000
body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion

26
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of disgust now influences our moral beliefs

27
0:01:41.002,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and even our deeply held political intuitions.

28
0:01:44.898,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Why this might be the case?

29
0:01:48.534,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We can understand this process by understanding

30
0:01:51.529,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,

31
0:01:54.679,000 --> 0:01:57,000
those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,

32
0:01:57.874,000 --> 0:01:59,000
exist because they motivate us to do good things

33
0:02:00.675,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they keep us away from doing bad things.

34
0:02:02.986,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So by and large, they are good for our survival.

35
0:02:06.369,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away

36
0:02:09.178,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from doing things that are really, really risky.

37
0:02:11.682,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This photo taken just before his death — (Laughter) —

38
0:02:15.522,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting

39
0:02:18.368,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is because most people would not do this, and if they did,

40
0:02:21.985,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they would not live to tell it, because fear would have

41
0:02:23.985,000 --> 0:02:26,000
kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.

42
0:02:27.66,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems

43
0:02:31.267,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is

44
0:02:33.601,000 --> 0:02:35,000
keeps us away from not things that might eat us,

45
0:02:36.196,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or heights, but rather things that might poison us,

46
0:02:38.861,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or give us disease and make us sick.

47
0:02:41.458,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such

48
0:02:44.715,000 --> 0:02:48,000
an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,

49
0:02:49.498,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,

50
0:02:52.381,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images

51
0:02:54.75,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I can probably make you feel disgust.

52
0:02:56.633,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.

53
0:02:59.828,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:00.961,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)

55
0:03:05.294,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Audience: Ewww.)

56
0:03:06.507,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.

57
0:03:09.516,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience

58
0:03:12.051,000 --> 0:03:15,000
feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,

59
0:03:15.886,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown

60
0:03:18.416,000 --> 0:03:2,000
sort of across the world to make people disgusted,

61
0:03:21.099,000 --> 0:03:24,000
things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.

62
0:03:24.703,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense

63
0:03:26.537,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.

64
0:03:29.791,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In fact, just having a diseased appearance

65
0:03:32.086,000 --> 0:03:34,000
or odd sexual acts, these things are also

66
0:03:34.486,000 --> 0:03:36,000
things that give us a lot of disgust.

67
0:03:37.477,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists

68
0:03:39.855,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to systematically investigate the human emotions,

69
0:03:41.798,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength

70
0:03:45.487,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the disgust response.

71
0:03:47.336,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.

72
0:03:50.607,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger

73
0:03:52.343,000 --> 0:03:54,000
some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...

74
0:03:54.848,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt

75
0:03:58.367,000 --> 0:04:,000
utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — (Laughter) —

76
0:04:01.365,000 --> 0:04:03,000
though his hands did not appear dirty."

77
0:04:03.522,000 --> 0:04:08,000
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages." (Laughter)

78
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists

79
0:04:11.664,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance

80
0:04:13.945,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,

81
0:04:16.235,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.

82
0:04:20.102,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex,

83
0:04:22.467,000 --> 0:04:25,000
are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions

84
0:04:25.489,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that are hard to jettison overnight."

85
0:04:30.189,000 --> 0:04:34,000
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that

86
0:04:34.226,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Professor Dawkins actually gagged.

87
0:04:36.869,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,

88
0:04:40.454,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and all three times he gagged. (Laughter)

89
0:04:44.01,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.

90
0:04:47.156,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One of the features, though, of disgust,

91
0:04:50.372,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is not just its universality and its strength,

92
0:04:53.302,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but the way that it works through association.

93
0:04:56.341,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,

94
0:05:00.076,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.

95
0:05:03.43,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to

96
0:05:06.637,000 --> 0:05:07,000
convince somebody that an object or an individual

97
0:05:08.403,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.

98
0:05:12.071,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out

99
0:05:14.612,000 --> 0:05:16,000
in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust

100
0:05:16.696,000 --> 0:05:19,000
properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness --

101
0:05:19.937,000 --> 0:05:21,000
have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...

102
0:05:22.237,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people --

103
0:05:26.089,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."

104
0:05:29.603,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful

105
0:05:32.735,000 --> 0:05:34,000
examples of how this has been used historically.

106
0:05:35.107,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:

107
0:05:38.697,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,

108
0:05:41.507,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...

109
0:05:44.817,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.

110
0:05:47.583,000 --> 0:05:49,000
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."

111
0:05:50.376,000 --> 0:05:52,000
A more modern example comes from people who try to

112
0:05:52.909,000 --> 0:05:54,000
convince us that homosexuality is immoral.

113
0:05:55.37,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is from an anti-gay website, where they said

114
0:05:59.055,000 --> 0:06:02,000
gays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."

115
0:06:02.332,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."

116
0:06:05.998,000 --> 0:06:07,000
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly

117
0:06:08.742,000 --> 0:06:11,000
linked to the social group that you should not like.

118
0:06:12.091,000 --> 0:06:14,000
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in

119
0:06:14.863,000 --> 0:06:17,000
moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in

120
0:06:18.732,000 --> 0:06:22,000
was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely

121
0:06:23.035,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.

122
0:06:26.1,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,

123
0:06:28.229,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are universal phenomena, it just really is true

124
0:06:30.845,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that some people are easier to disgust than others.

125
0:06:33.143,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You could probably see it in the audience members

126
0:06:34.829,000 --> 0:06:36,000
when I showed you those disgusting images.

127
0:06:36.886,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was

128
0:06:39.586,000 --> 0:06:41,000
constructed by some other psychologists

129
0:06:41.915,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations

130
0:06:44.772,000 --> 0:06:46,000
how likely they are to feel disgust.

131
0:06:46.873,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So here are a couple of examples.

132
0:06:48.666,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my

133
0:06:50.838,000 --> 0:06:53,000
favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."

134
0:06:54.646,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Do you agree or disagree?" (Laughter)

135
0:06:56.211,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,

136
0:06:58.491,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"

137
0:07:02.155,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall

138
0:07:04.811,000 --> 0:07:06,000
score of disgust sensitivity.

139
0:07:07.174,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.

140
0:07:09.647,000 --> 0:07:12,000
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask

141
0:07:12.724,000 --> 0:07:15,000
them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors

142
0:07:16.553,000 --> 0:07:21,000
like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,

143
0:07:21.575,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,

144
0:07:25.54,000 --> 0:07:27,000
your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not

145
0:07:28.531,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.

146
0:07:30.874,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The first time that we set out to collect data on this

147
0:07:33.472,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and associate it with political or moral beliefs,

148
0:07:35.482,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we found a general pattern --

149
0:07:38.359,000 --> 0:07:41,000
this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom --

150
0:07:41.661,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that in fact, across three studies we kept finding

151
0:07:45.681,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that people who reported that they were easily disgusted

152
0:07:48.202,000 --> 0:07:51,000
also reported that they were more politically conservative.

153
0:07:51.657,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Another way to say this, though, is that people

154
0:07:53.541,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)

155
0:07:58.948,000 --> 0:08:02,000
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at

156
0:08:03.218,000 --> 0:08:05,000
a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,

157
0:08:05.899,000 --> 0:08:07,000
this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,

158
0:08:08.491,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and we find the same pattern. As you can see,

159
0:08:11.268,000 --> 0:08:12,000
people who are on the very conservative side

160
0:08:13.213,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of answering the political orientation scale are

161
0:08:15.915,000 --> 0:08:17,000
also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.

162
0:08:18.685,000 --> 0:08:2,000
This data set also allowed us to statistically control

163
0:08:21.18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
for a number of things that we knew were both related

164
0:08:23.404,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.

165
0:08:26.319,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So we were able to control for gender, age, income,

166
0:08:28.924,000 --> 0:08:31,000
education, even basic personality variables,

167
0:08:32.215,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the result stays the same.

168
0:08:34.517,000 --> 0:08:37,000
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,

169
0:08:37.943,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically

170
0:08:40.843,000 --> 0:08:42,000
across the nation. What we found was that in regions

171
0:08:43.789,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,

172
0:08:47.686,000 --> 0:08:48,000
McCain got more votes.

173
0:08:49.673,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,

174
0:08:52.791,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but actual voting behavior. And also we were able,

175
0:08:55.163,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with this sample, to look across the world,

176
0:08:57.855,000 --> 0:09:,000
in 121 different countries we asked the same questions,

177
0:09:01.449,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed

178
0:09:05.376,000 --> 0:09:07,000
into 10 different geographical regions.

179
0:09:07.746,000 --> 0:09:09,000
No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size

180
0:09:10.37,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,

181
0:09:13.781,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.

182
0:09:17.42,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Other labs have actually looked at this as well

183
0:09:20.857,000 --> 0:09:22,000
using different measures of disgust sensitivity,

184
0:09:23.034,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,

185
0:09:25.586,000 --> 0:09:27,000
they hook people up to physiological measures,

186
0:09:27.926,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in this case skin conductance.

187
0:09:29.554,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report

188
0:09:31.782,000 --> 0:09:35,000
being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused

189
0:09:35.908,000 --> 0:09:38,000
when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.

190
0:09:39.482,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding

191
0:09:41.651,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that we kept getting in our previous studies as well

192
0:09:45.676,000 --> 0:09:48,000
was that one of the strongest influences here is that

193
0:09:49.423,000 --> 0:09:51,000
individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are

194
0:09:51.633,000 --> 0:09:53,000
more likely to report being politically conservative, but

195
0:09:53.719,000 --> 0:09:56,000
they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage

196
0:09:56.728,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of

197
0:09:58.877,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.

198
0:10:02.642,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study,

199
0:10:06.131,000 --> 0:10:07,000
attitudes toward gay marriage.

200
0:10:07.829,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity

201
0:10:11.048,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is

202
0:10:14.207,000 --> 0:10:17,000
what is the causal link here? Is it the case that

203
0:10:17.278,000 --> 0:10:2,000
disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?

204
0:10:20.552,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,

205
0:10:23.112,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab

206
0:10:25.887,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and disgust them and compare them to a control group

207
0:10:28.31,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over

208
0:10:30.718,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the past five years a number of researchers have done this,

209
0:10:33.446,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and by and large the results have all been the same,

210
0:10:36.272,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes

211
0:10:38.701,000 --> 0:10:4,000
shift towards the right of the political spectrum,

212
0:10:40.804,000 --> 0:10:42,000
toward more moral conservatism as well.

213
0:10:43.48,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,

214
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,

215
0:10:52.45,000 --> 0:10:54,000
images like the ones I've shown you, even just

216
0:10:54.816,000 --> 0:10:55,000
reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should

217
0:10:56.779,000 --> 0:10:59,000
be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,

218
0:11:00.418,000 --> 0:11:02,000
these all have similar effects on judgment.

219
0:11:03.198,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Let me just give you an example from a recent study

220
0:11:05.564,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that we conducted. We asked participants

221
0:11:08.524,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,

222
0:11:13.221,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and we either made the room smell gross or not.

223
0:11:17.633,000 --> 0:11:2,000
When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that

224
0:11:20.804,000 --> 0:11:23,000
individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.

225
0:11:24.475,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other

226
0:11:26.698,000 --> 0:11:28,000
social groups that we asked, including African-Americans,

227
0:11:29.091,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had

228
0:11:32.953,000 --> 0:11:33,000
toward gay men.

229
0:11:34.346,000 --> 0:11:37,000
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people --

230
0:11:37.907,000 --> 0:11:38,000
this was at a time when the swine flu was going around --

231
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread

232
0:11:42.317,000 --> 0:11:45,000
of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.

233
0:11:46.035,000 --> 0:11:5,000
For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires

234
0:11:50.45,000 --> 0:11:52,000
next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.

235
0:11:53.371,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire

236
0:11:55.891,000 --> 0:11:58,000
next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals

237
0:11:59.604,000 --> 0:12:02,000
report being more politically conservative.

238
0:12:02.767,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And when we asked them a variety of questions about

239
0:12:04.804,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also

240
0:12:08.227,000 --> 0:12:1,000
found was that simply being reminded that they ought

241
0:12:10.542,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.

242
0:12:13.851,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In particular, when we asked them questions about

243
0:12:16.148,000 --> 0:12:19,000
sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,

244
0:12:19.922,000 --> 0:12:21,000
just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands

245
0:12:22.548,000 --> 0:12:24,000
made them think that they were more morally wrong.

246
0:12:25.111,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless

247
0:12:27.511,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.

248
0:12:30.276,000 --> 0:12:33,000
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.

249
0:12:34.034,000 --> 0:12:36,000
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend

250
0:12:36.752,000 --> 0:12:37,000
on his grandma's bed.

251
0:12:38.1,000 --> 0:12:4,000
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating

252
0:12:40.597,000 --> 0:12:43,000
with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)

253
0:12:44.491,000 --> 0:12:46,000
People find these to be more morally abhorrent

254
0:12:47.123,000 --> 0:12:51,000
if they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)

255
0:12:51.439,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:54.631,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment

257
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
should come as no surprise. I mean,

258
0:13:00.043,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that's part of how emotions work.

259
0:13:01.444,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,

260
0:13:03.008,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but they change the way you think.

261
0:13:05.092,000 --> 0:13:07,000
In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising

262
0:13:07.882,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,

263
0:13:11.327,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust

264
0:13:14.206,000 --> 0:13:16,000
would make me change the way that I perceive

265
0:13:16.862,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the physical world whenever contamination is possible.

266
0:13:19.905,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built

267
0:13:22.837,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict

268
0:13:25.743,000 --> 0:13:28,000
who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.

269
0:13:29.119,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The question of whether disgust ought to influence

270
0:13:31.927,000 --> 0:13:33,000
our moral and political judgments

271
0:13:34.279,000 --> 0:13:37,000
certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly

272
0:13:37.415,000 --> 0:13:39,000
what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,

273
0:13:40.097,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method

274
0:13:42.103,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.

275
0:13:45.607,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is,

276
0:13:47.655,000 --> 0:13:49,000
at the very least, what we can do with this research is

277
0:13:50.474,000 --> 0:13:52,000
point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.

278
0:13:53.326,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Thank you. (Applause)

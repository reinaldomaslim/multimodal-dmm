1
0:00:12.496,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm very pleased to be here today

2
0:00:14.405,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to talk to you all about how we might repair

3
0:00:16.959,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the damaged brain,

4
0:00:18.995,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I'm particularly excited by this field,

5
0:00:21.237,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because as a neurologist myself,

6
0:00:23.722,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I believe that this offers one of the great ways

7
0:00:25.523,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that we might be able to offer hope

8
0:00:27.455,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for patients who today live with devastating

9
0:00:30.028,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.

10
0:00:33.986,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So here's the problem.

11
0:00:36.076,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You can see here the picture of somebody's brain

12
0:00:38.876,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with Alzheimer's disease

13
0:00:40.408,000 --> 0:00:41,000
next to a healthy brain,

14
0:00:42.327,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,

15
0:00:44.943,000 --> 0:00:48,000
ringed red, there's obvious damage -- atrophy, scarring.

16
0:00:49.661,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I could show you equivalent pictures

17
0:00:51.378,000 --> 0:00:53,000
from other disease: multiple sclerosis,

18
0:00:53.605,000 --> 0:00:55,000
motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,

19
0:00:56.123,000 --> 0:00:58,000
even Huntington's disease,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they would all tell a similar story.

21
0:01:01.229,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And collectively these brain disorders represent

22
0:01:03.369,000 --> 0:01:06,000
one of the major public health threats of our time.

23
0:01:06.935,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And the numbers here are really rather staggering.

24
0:01:11.183,000 --> 0:01:14,000
At any one time, there are 35 million people today

25
0:01:14.375,000 --> 0:01:16,000
living with one of these brain diseases,

26
0:01:17.332,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and the annual cost globally

27
0:01:19.871,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is 700 billion dollars.

28
0:01:21.891,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I mean, just think about that.

29
0:01:23.753,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's greater than one percent

30
0:01:25.24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of the global GDP.

31
0:01:27.986,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it gets worse,

32
0:01:29.892,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because all these numbers are rising

33
0:01:32.054,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because these are by and large

34
0:01:33.512,000 --> 0:01:36,000
age-related diseases, and we're living longer.

35
0:01:36.7,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,

36
0:01:39.095,000 --> 0:01:42,000
why, given the devastating impact of these diseases

37
0:01:43.092,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to the individual,

38
0:01:44.572,000 --> 0:01:46,000
never mind the scale of the societal problem,

39
0:01:47.325,000 --> 0:01:5,000
why are there no effective treatments?

40
0:01:50.906,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now in order to consider this,

41
0:01:52.884,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I first need to give you a crash course

42
0:01:55.167,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in how the brain works.

43
0:01:57.492,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So in other words, I need to tell you

44
0:01:59.378,000 --> 0:02:01,000
everything I learned at medical school.

45
0:02:01.434,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:03.474,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.

47
0:02:05.712,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Okay? (Laughter)

48
0:02:08.167,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So the brain is terribly simple:

49
0:02:10.136,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it's made up of four cells,

50
0:02:13.183,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and two of them are shown here.

51
0:02:14.985,000 --> 0:02:15,000
There's the nerve cell,

52
0:02:16.498,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and then there's the myelinating cell,

53
0:02:18.038,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or the insulating cell.

54
0:02:19.536,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's called oligodendrocyte.

55
0:02:22.026,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And when these four cells work together

56
0:02:23.815,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in health and harmony,

57
0:02:25.674,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity,

58
0:02:29.642,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and it is this electrical activity

59
0:02:31.882,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that underpins our ability to think, to emote,

60
0:02:35.255,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.

61
0:02:38.599,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But equally, each of these individual four cells

62
0:02:41.94,000 --> 0:02:46,000
alone or together, can go rogue or die,

63
0:02:47.03,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and when that happens, you get damage.

64
0:02:49.275,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You get damaged wiring.

65
0:02:50.49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You get disrupted connections.

66
0:02:53.554,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And that's evident here with the slower conduction.

67
0:02:57.712,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But ultimately, this damage will manifest

68
0:03:00.175,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as disease, clearly.

69
0:03:02.657,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And if the starting dying nerve cell

70
0:03:05.755,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is a motor nerve, for example,

71
0:03:07.571,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you'll get motor neuron disease.

72
0:03:09.986,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration

73
0:03:12.609,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of what happens with motor neuron disease.

74
0:03:16.017,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So this is a patient of mine called John.

75
0:03:18.546,000 --> 0:03:21,000
John I saw just last week in the clinic.

76
0:03:21.559,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I've asked John to tell us something about what were his problems

77
0:03:25.183,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that led to the initial diagnosis

78
0:03:27.082,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of motor neuron disease.

79
0:03:28.721,000 --> 0:03:32,000
John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,

80
0:03:33.67,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the main problem was a breathing problem,

81
0:03:37.25,000 --> 0:03:38,000
difficulty breathing.

82
0:03:38.943,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you caught all of that, but what John was telling us

83
0:03:41.203,000 --> 0:03:43,000
was that difficulty with breathing

84
0:03:43.443,000 --> 0:03:45,000
led eventually to the diagnosis

85
0:03:45.537,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of motor neuron disease.

86
0:03:48.39,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So John's now 18 months further down in that journey,

87
0:03:51.954,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I've now asked him to tell us something about

88
0:03:54.187,000 --> 0:03:56,000
his current predicament.

89
0:03:56.476,000 --> 0:03:58,000
John: What I've got now is the breathing's gotten worse.

90
0:03:59.336,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I've got weakness in my hands, my arms and my legs.

91
0:04:05.033,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.

92
0:04:09.853,000 --> 0:04:11,000
SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair

93
0:04:12.679,000 --> 0:04:14,000
most of the time.

94
0:04:14.803,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So what these two clips show

95
0:04:17.021,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is not just the devastating consequence of the disease,

96
0:04:19.777,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but they also tell us something about

97
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the shocking pace of the disease,

98
0:04:23.62,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because in just 18 months,

99
0:04:26.932,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a fit adult man has been rendered

100
0:04:29.628,000 --> 0:04:32,000
wheelchair- and respirator-dependent.

101
0:04:32.959,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And let's face it, John could be anybody's father,

102
0:04:35.264,000 --> 0:04:37,000
brother or friend.

103
0:04:37.451,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.

104
0:04:39.704,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But what happens when that myelin cell dies?

105
0:04:44.304,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You get multiple sclerosis.

106
0:04:46.524,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So the scan on your left

107
0:04:48.343,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is an illustration of the brain,

108
0:04:51.066,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and it's a map of the connections of the brain,

109
0:04:53.917,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and superimposed upon which

110
0:04:55.884,000 --> 0:04:56,000
are areas of damage.

111
0:04:57.258,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We call them lesions of demyelination.

112
0:04:59.449,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But they're damage, and they're white.

113
0:05:02.281,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I know what you're thinking here.

114
0:05:03.796,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up

115
0:05:06.304,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and said he's going to talk about hope,

116
0:05:08.235,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and all he's done is give a really rather bleak

117
0:05:10.744,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and depressing tale."

118
0:05:12.308,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I've told you these diseases are terrible.

119
0:05:13.903,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They're devastating, numbers are rising,

120
0:05:16.564,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,

121
0:05:18.691,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we have no treatment. Where's the hope?

122
0:05:20.977,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Well, you know what? I think there is hope.

123
0:05:23.522,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And there's hope in this next section,

124
0:05:25.916,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,

125
0:05:28.211,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because what it illustrates

126
0:05:29.739,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.

127
0:05:32.212,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It just doesn't do it well enough.

128
0:05:34.79,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And so again, there are two things I want to show you.

129
0:05:36.915,000 --> 0:05:39,000
First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.

130
0:05:40.341,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And again, it's another one of these white masses.

131
0:05:43.824,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But crucially, the area that's ringed red

132
0:05:47.262,000 --> 0:05:49,000
highlights an area that is pale blue.

133
0:05:49.485,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But that area that is pale blue was once white.

134
0:05:52.311,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So it was damaged. It's now repaired.

135
0:05:55.922,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.

136
0:05:58.684,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.

137
0:06:01.001,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is spontaneous repair.

138
0:06:03.184,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's amazing and it's occurred

139
0:06:04.732,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because there are stem cells in the brain, even,

140
0:06:07.946,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which can enable new myelin, new insulation,

141
0:06:11.12,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to be laid down over the damaged nerves.

142
0:06:13.449,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And this observation is important for two reasons.

143
0:06:17.936,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies

144
0:06:21.176,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that we learnt at medical school,

145
0:06:22.805,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or at least I did, admittedly last century,

146
0:06:26.425,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which is that the brain doesn't repair itself,

147
0:06:28.996,000 --> 0:06:31,000
unlike, say, the bone or the liver.

148
0:06:32.117,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But actually it does, but it just doesn't do it well enough.

149
0:06:35.616,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And the second thing it does,

150
0:06:37.258,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it gives us a very clear direction of travel for new therapies --

151
0:06:41.233,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist

152
0:06:42.952,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to know what to do here.

153
0:06:44.472,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You simply need to find ways of promoting

154
0:06:47.405,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the endogenous, spontaneous repair that occurs anyway.

155
0:06:51.929,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So the question is, why, if we've known that

156
0:06:54.386,000 --> 0:06:55,000
for some time, as we have,

157
0:06:56.343,000 --> 0:07:,000
why do we not have those treatments?

158
0:07:00.637,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And that in part reflects the complexity

159
0:07:02.756,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of drug development.

160
0:07:05.367,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, drug development you might think of

161
0:07:07.401,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as a rather expensive but risky bet,

162
0:07:10.125,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the odds of this bet are roughly this:

163
0:07:12.078,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they're 10,000 to one against,

164
0:07:14.675,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because you need to screen about 10,000 compounds

165
0:07:17.48,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to find that one potential winner.

166
0:07:19.551,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And then you need to spend 15 years

167
0:07:21.468,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and spend over a billion dollars,

168
0:07:22.966,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and even then, you may not have a winner.

169
0:07:26.109,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So the question for us is,

170
0:07:27.788,000 --> 0:07:28,000
can you change the rules of the game

171
0:07:29.379,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and can you shorten the odds?

172
0:07:31.928,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And in order to do that, you have to think,

173
0:07:33.972,000 --> 0:07:35,000
where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?

174
0:07:36.802,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery.

175
0:07:39.915,000 --> 0:07:42,000
All that screening occurs in animal models.

176
0:07:43.877,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But we know that the proper study of mankind is man,

177
0:07:47.336,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to borrow from Alexander Pope.

178
0:07:49.44,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So the question is, can we study these diseases

179
0:07:51.811,000 --> 0:07:53,000
using human material?

180
0:07:54.199,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And of course, absolutely we can.

181
0:07:56.262,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We can use stem cells,

182
0:07:57.791,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and specifically we can use human stem cells.

183
0:08:00.591,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And human stem cells are these extraordinary

184
0:08:02.695,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but simple cells that can do two things:

185
0:08:05.097,000 --> 0:08:07,000
they can self-renew or make more of themselves,

186
0:08:07.891,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but they can also become specialized

187
0:08:09.949,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,

188
0:08:12.548,000 --> 0:08:13,000
maybe even the motor nerve cell

189
0:08:14.388,000 --> 0:08:16,000
or the myelin cell.

190
0:08:16.548,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And the challenge has long been,

191
0:08:18.069,000 --> 0:08:19,000
can we harness the power,

192
0:08:20.041,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the undoubted power of these stem cells

193
0:08:22.326,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in order to realize their promise

194
0:08:24.344,000 --> 0:08:25,000
for regenerative neurology?

195
0:08:25.971,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I think we can now, and the reason we can

196
0:08:28.9,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is because there have been several major discoveries

197
0:08:31.808,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in the last 10, 20 years.

198
0:08:33.545,000 --> 0:08:34,000
One of them was here in Edinburgh,

199
0:08:35.157,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.

200
0:08:39.269,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,

201
0:08:40.894,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and Dolly was an example

202
0:08:42.577,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of the first cloning of a mammal

203
0:08:45.791,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from an adult cell.

204
0:08:47.739,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But I think the even more significant breakthrough

205
0:08:50.544,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for the purposes of our discussion today

206
0:08:53.466,000 --> 0:08:55,000
was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist

207
0:08:55.955,000 --> 0:08:56,000
called Yamanaka.

208
0:08:57.552,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And what Yamaka did,

209
0:08:58.856,000 --> 0:09:,000
in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,

210
0:09:01.288,000 --> 0:09:03,000
was he showed that four ingredients,

211
0:09:03.326,000 --> 0:09:04,000
just four ingredients,

212
0:09:05.189,000 --> 0:09:08,000
could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,

213
0:09:08.376,000 --> 0:09:1,000
into a master stem cell.

214
0:09:10.618,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,

215
0:09:13.602,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because what it means that from anybody in this room,

216
0:09:15.842,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but particularly patients,

217
0:09:17.646,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you could now generate

218
0:09:18.977,000 --> 0:09:2,000
a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.

219
0:09:21.703,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,

220
0:09:24.651,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so you could then make those cells

221
0:09:26.39,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that are relevant to their disease,

222
0:09:28.829,000 --> 0:09:3,000
both to study but potentially to treat.

223
0:09:31.471,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, the idea of that at medical school --

224
0:09:33.533,000 --> 0:09:35,000
this is a recurring theme, isn't it, me and medical school? —

225
0:09:36.158,000 --> 0:09:37,000
would have been ridiculous,

226
0:09:37.976,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but it's an absolute reality today.

227
0:09:40.035,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I see this as the cornerstone

228
0:09:42.169,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of regeneration, repair and hope.

229
0:09:45.346,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And whilst we're on the theme of hope,

230
0:09:47.296,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for those of you who might have failed at school,

231
0:09:49.437,000 --> 0:09:51,000
there's hope for you as well,

232
0:09:51.662,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because this is the school report of John Gerdon.

233
0:09:54.158,000 --> 0:09:55,000
["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."]

234
0:09:55.37,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So they didn't think much of him then.

235
0:09:56.806,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But what you may not know is that he got the Nobel Prize for medicine

236
0:09:59.664,000 --> 0:10:01,000
just three months ago.

237
0:10:02.216,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So to return to the original problem,

238
0:10:04.782,000 --> 0:10:06,000
what is the opportunity of these stem cells,

239
0:10:06.925,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or this disruptive technology,

240
0:10:08.586,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for repairing the damaged brain,

241
0:10:10.14,000 --> 0:10:12,000
which we call regenerative neurology?

242
0:10:12.271,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I think there are two ways you can think about this:

243
0:10:14.698,000 --> 0:10:17,000
as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,

244
0:10:18.146,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and/or as a form of therapy.

245
0:10:20.963,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those

246
0:10:22.99,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in the next few moments.

247
0:10:25.439,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Drug discovery in a dish is how people often

248
0:10:27.47,000 --> 0:10:28,000
talk about this.

249
0:10:28.7,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,

250
0:10:31.627,000 --> 0:10:32,000
let's say motor neuron disease,

251
0:10:33.446,000 --> 0:10:34,000
you take a skin sample,

252
0:10:35.203,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you do the pluripotent reprogramming,

253
0:10:38.261,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as I've already told you,

254
0:10:40.352,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and you generate live motor nerve cells.

255
0:10:42.869,000 --> 0:10:43,000
That's straightforward, because that's what

256
0:10:44.603,000 --> 0:10:45,000
pluripotent cells can do.

257
0:10:46.34,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But crucially, you can then compare their behavior

258
0:10:49.296,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,

259
0:10:51.719,000 --> 0:10:53,000
ideally from an unaffected relative.

260
0:10:53.749,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That way, you're matching for genetic variation.

261
0:10:56.991,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that's exactly what we did here.

262
0:10:59.338,000 --> 0:11:,000
This was a collaboration with colleagues:

263
0:11:01.261,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.

264
0:11:04.784,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And what you're looking at, and this is amazing,

265
0:11:07.306,000 --> 0:11:09,000
these are living, growing, motor nerve cells

266
0:11:10.106,000 --> 0:11:12,000
from a patient with motor neuron disease.

267
0:11:12.349,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It happens to be an inherited form.

268
0:11:14.274,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I mean, just imagine that.

269
0:11:15.973,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.

270
0:11:18.454,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So apart from seeing them grow and put out processes,

271
0:11:21.808,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,

272
0:11:24.25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but crucially, we can then track their individual health

273
0:11:27.309,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and compare the diseased motor nerve cells

274
0:11:29.829,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to the healthy ones.

275
0:11:31.701,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And when you do all that and put it together,

276
0:11:35.188,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you realize that the diseased ones,

277
0:11:37.287,000 --> 0:11:38,000
which is represented in the red line,

278
0:11:39.075,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are two and a half times more likely to die

279
0:11:42.696,000 --> 0:11:44,000
than the healthy counterpart.

280
0:11:45.401,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the crucial point about this is that you then have

281
0:11:48.044,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a fantastic assay to discover drugs,

282
0:11:51.633,000 --> 0:11:52,000
because what would you ask of the drugs,

283
0:11:53.542,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and you could do this through a high-throughput

284
0:11:55.303,000 --> 0:11:57,000
automated screening system,

285
0:11:57.712,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:

286
0:12:00.158,000 --> 0:12:02,000
find me a drug that will bring the red line

287
0:12:02.983,000 --> 0:12:03,000
closer to the blue line,

288
0:12:04.873,000 --> 0:12:07,000
because that drug will be a high-value candidate

289
0:12:08.092,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that you could probably take direct to human trial

290
0:12:10.992,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and almost bypass that bottleneck

291
0:12:13.579,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that I've told you about in drug discovery

292
0:12:15.98,000 --> 0:12:16,000
with the animal models,

293
0:12:17.793,000 --> 0:12:19,000
if that makes sense. It's fantastic.

294
0:12:20.446,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But I want to come back

295
0:12:22.01,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to how you might use stem cells directly

296
0:12:24.059,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to repair damage.

297
0:12:25.834,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And again there are two ways to think about this,

298
0:12:27.659,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and they're not mutually exclusive.

299
0:12:29.674,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The first, and I think in the long run

300
0:12:31.964,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the one that will give us the biggest dividend,

301
0:12:34.193,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but it's not thought of that way just yet,

302
0:12:36.797,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is to think about those stem cells that are already

303
0:12:40.053,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in your brain, and I've told you that.

304
0:12:41.893,000 --> 0:12:42,000
All of us have stem cells in the brain,

305
0:12:43.747,000 --> 0:12:44,000
even the diseased brain,

306
0:12:45.382,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and surely the smart way forward

307
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is to find ways that you can promote and activate

308
0:12:49.497,000 --> 0:12:51,000
those stem cells in your brain already

309
0:12:51.533,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to react and respond appropriately to damage

310
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to repair it.

311
0:12:56.004,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That will be the future.

312
0:12:57.436,000 --> 0:12:59,000
There will be drugs that will do that.

313
0:13:00.309,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,

314
0:13:04.572,000 --> 0:13:05,000
transplant them in,

315
0:13:06.376,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.

316
0:13:10.854,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And I want to tell you now an experiment,

317
0:13:12.942,000 --> 0:13:13,000
it's a clinical trial that we did,

318
0:13:14.836,000 --> 0:13:15,000
which recently completed,

319
0:13:16.692,000 --> 0:13:18,000
which is with colleagues in UCL,

320
0:13:19.209,000 --> 0:13:21,000
David Miller in particular.

321
0:13:21.964,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So this study was very simple.

322
0:13:23.877,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We took patients with multiple sclerosis

323
0:13:26.979,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and asked a simple question:

324
0:13:28.517,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Would stem cells from the bone marrow

325
0:13:30.191,000 --> 0:13:31,000
be protective of their nerves?

326
0:13:31.914,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So what we did was we took this bone marrow,

327
0:13:35.759,000 --> 0:13:37,000
grew up the stem cells in the lab,

328
0:13:37.976,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and then injected them back into the vein.

329
0:13:40.315,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I'm making this sound really simple.

330
0:13:42.115,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It took five years off a lot of people, okay?

331
0:13:45.222,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it put gray hair on me

332
0:13:46.91,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and caused all kinds of issues.

333
0:13:48.391,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But conceptually, it's essentially simple.

334
0:13:52.414,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So we've given them into the vein, right?

335
0:13:55.721,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So in order to measure whether this was successful or not,

336
0:13:59.354,000 --> 0:14:,000
we measured the optic nerve

337
0:14:01.102,000 --> 0:14:02,000
as our outcome measure.

338
0:14:02.788,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,

339
0:14:04.553,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because patients with M.S. sadly suffer

340
0:14:06.626,000 --> 0:14:07,000
with problems with vision --

341
0:14:08.098,000 --> 0:14:1,000
loss of vision, unclear vision.

342
0:14:10.288,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And so we measured the size of the optic nerve

343
0:14:12.371,000 --> 0:14:14,000
using the scans with David Miller

344
0:14:14.425,000 --> 0:14:16,000
three times -- 12 months, six months,

345
0:14:16.523,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and before the infusion --

346
0:14:18.139,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and you can see the gently declining red line.

347
0:14:21.265,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking,

348
0:14:23.493,000 --> 0:14:25,000
which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.

349
0:14:25.836,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We then gave the stem cell infusion

350
0:14:28.142,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and repeated the measurement twice --

351
0:14:30.243,000 --> 0:14:31,000
three months and six months --

352
0:14:31.882,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and to our surprise, almost,

353
0:14:33.855,000 --> 0:14:35,000
the line's gone up.

354
0:14:36.011,000 --> 0:14:38,000
That suggests that the intervention

355
0:14:38.542,000 --> 0:14:39,000
has been protective.

356
0:14:40.439,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I don't think myself that what's happened

357
0:14:42.356,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is that those stem cells have made new myelin

358
0:14:44.392,000 --> 0:14:45,000
or new nerves.

359
0:14:45.856,000 --> 0:14:47,000
What I think they've done is they've promoted

360
0:14:48.001,000 --> 0:14:5,000
the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,

361
0:14:50.61,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.

362
0:14:54.061,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So this is a proof of concept.

363
0:14:56.36,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I'm very excited about that.

364
0:14:58.985,000 --> 0:15:,000
So I just want to end with the theme I began on,

365
0:15:01.474,000 --> 0:15:02,000
which was regeneration and hope.

366
0:15:03.464,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So here I've asked John

367
0:15:05.234,000 --> 0:15:07,000
what his hopes are for the future.

368
0:15:07.532,000 --> 0:15:08,000
John: I would hope that

369
0:15:09.286,000 --> 0:15:1,000
sometime in the future

370
0:15:11.086,000 --> 0:15:13,000
through the research that you people are doing,

371
0:15:13.526,000 --> 0:15:15,000
we can come up with a cure

372
0:15:15.735,000 --> 0:15:18,000
so that people like me can lead a normal life.

373
0:15:19.559,000 --> 0:15:21,000
SC: I mean, that speaks volumes.

374
0:15:22.154,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --

375
0:15:24.693,000 --> 0:15:25,000
thanking John for allowing me to share

376
0:15:26.422,000 --> 0:15:29,000
his insights and these clips with you all.

377
0:15:29.592,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But I'd also like to add to John and to others

378
0:15:32.127,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.

379
0:15:34.704,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I do believe that the disruptive technologies

380
0:15:37.056,000 --> 0:15:39,000
like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you

381
0:15:39.114,000 --> 0:15:4,000
do offer very real hope.

382
0:15:40.935,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And I do think that the day that we might be able

383
0:15:42.698,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to repair the damaged brain

384
0:15:44.134,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is sooner than we think.

385
0:15:45.423,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you.

386
0:15:47.226,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Applause)

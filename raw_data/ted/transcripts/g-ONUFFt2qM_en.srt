1
0:00:12.991,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was four years old,

2
0:00:14.687,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my dad taught me the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance,

3
0:00:17.606,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a traditional dance born hundreds of years ago in Southwestern USA.

4
0:00:22.508,000 --> 0:00:24,000
A series of hoops are created out of willow wood,

5
0:00:25.452,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and they're threaded together to create formations of the natural world,

6
0:00:29.338,000 --> 0:00:31,000
showing the many beauties of life.

7
0:00:31.923,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In this dance, you're circling in a constant spin,

8
0:00:34.929,000 --> 0:00:36,000
mimicking the movement of the Sun

9
0:00:37.015,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the passage of time.

10
0:00:40.232,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Watching this dance was magic to me.

11
0:00:43.515,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Like with a time capsule,

12
0:00:44.897,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was taking a look through a cultural window to the past.

13
0:00:48.201,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I felt a deeper connection

14
0:00:50.133,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to how my ancestors used to look at the world around them.

15
0:00:54.046,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Since then, I've always been obsessed with time capsules.

16
0:00:57.819,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They take on many forms,

17
0:00:59.471,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but the common thread is that they're uncontrollably fascinating

18
0:01:02.58,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to us as human beings,

19
0:01:04.726,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because they're portals to a memory,

20
0:01:06.916,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and they hold the important power of keeping stories alive.

21
0:01:11.503,000 --> 0:01:13,000
As a filmmaker and composer,

22
0:01:13.636,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it's been my journey to find my voice,

23
0:01:16.239,000 --> 0:01:19,000
reclaim the stories of my heritage and the past

24
0:01:19.632,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and infuse them into music and film time capsules to share.

25
0:01:24.838,000 --> 0:01:26,000
To tell you a bit about how I found my voice,

26
0:01:27.188,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'd like to share a bit about how I grew up.

27
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In Southern California, I grew up in a multigenerational home,

28
0:01:33.296,000 --> 0:01:34,000
meaning I lived under the same roof

29
0:01:35.21,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as my parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents.

30
0:01:38.936,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese with immigrant parents,

31
0:01:43.583,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and my father is Ojibwe

32
0:01:45.593,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and an enrolled tribal member

33
0:01:47.221,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the Prairie Band's Potawatomi Tribe in Northeastern Kansas.

34
0:01:51.238,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So one weekend I'd be learning how to fold dumplings,

35
0:01:54.242,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and the next, I'd be traditional-style dancing

36
0:01:56.571,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at a powwow,

37
0:01:57.792,000 --> 0:02:,000
immersed in the powerful sounds of drums and singers.

38
0:02:02.405,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Being surrounded by many cultures was the norm,

39
0:02:05.035,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but also a very confusing experience.

40
0:02:08.5,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It was really hard for me to find my voice,

41
0:02:10.713,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because I never felt I was enough --

42
0:02:12.979,000 --> 0:02:15,000
never Chinese, Dutch-Indonesian or Native enough.

43
0:02:17.381,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Because I never felt I was a part of any community,

44
0:02:20.456,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I sought to learn the stories of my heritage

45
0:02:23.913,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and connect them together to rediscover my own.

46
0:02:27.254,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The first medium I felt gave me a voice was music.

47
0:02:32.043,000 --> 0:02:35,000
With layers of sounds and multiple instruments,

48
0:02:35.249,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I could create soundscapes and worlds that were much bigger than my own.

49
0:02:39.556,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Through music, I'm inviting you into a sonic portal

50
0:02:42.46,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of my memories and emotions,

51
0:02:44.486,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and I'm holding up a mirror to yours.

52
0:02:47.538,000 --> 0:02:5,000
One of my favorite instruments to play is the guzheng zither,

53
0:02:50.762,000 --> 0:02:51,000
a Chinese harp-like instrument.

54
0:02:53.19,000 --> 0:02:55,000
While the hoop dance is hundreds of years old,

55
0:02:55.518,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the guzheng has more than 2,000 years of history.

56
0:02:59.337,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I'm playing the styles that greatly influence me today,

57
0:03:02.036,000 --> 0:03:03,000
like electronic music,

58
0:03:03.697,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with an instrument that was used to play traditional folk music long ago.

59
0:03:08.235,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I noticed an interesting connection:

60
0:03:11.077,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the zither is tuned to the pentatonic scale,

61
0:03:13.532,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a scale that is universally known in so many parts of music

62
0:03:17.108,000 --> 0:03:18,000
around the world,

63
0:03:18.317,000 --> 0:03:2,000
including Native American folk songs.

64
0:03:21.781,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In both Chinese and Native folk,

65
0:03:23.727,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I sense this inherent sound of longing and holding onto the past,

66
0:03:28.008,000 --> 0:03:31,000
an emotion that greatly drives the music I create today.

67
0:03:32.603,000 --> 0:03:35,000
At the time, I wondered if I could make this feeling of immersion

68
0:03:36.165,000 --> 0:03:37,000
even more powerful,

69
0:03:37.347,000 --> 0:03:39,000
by layering visuals and music --

70
0:03:39.583,000 --> 0:03:41,000
visuals and images on top of the music.

71
0:03:42.87,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I turned to internet tutorials to learn editing software,

72
0:03:46.472,000 --> 0:03:48,000
went to community college to save money

73
0:03:48.593,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and created films.

74
0:03:51.012,000 --> 0:03:52,000
After a few years experimenting,

75
0:03:52.775,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was 17 and had something I wanted to tell and preserve.

76
0:03:56.197,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It started with a question:

77
0:03:58.692,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What happens when a story is forgotten?

78
0:04:02.985,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I lead with this in my latest documentary film,

79
0:04:05.679,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"Smoke That Travels,"

80
0:04:07.22,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which immerses people into the world of music, song, color and dance,

81
0:04:12.529,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as I explore my fear that a part of my identity, my Native heritage,

82
0:04:17.865,000 --> 0:04:19,000
will be forgotten in time.

83
0:04:20.728,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Many indigenous languages are dying due to historically forced assimilation.

84
0:04:25.619,000 --> 0:04:28,000
From the late 1800s to the early 1970s,

85
0:04:29.261,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Natives were forced into boarding schools,

86
0:04:31.72,000 --> 0:04:34,000
where they were violently punished if they practiced traditional ways

87
0:04:35.34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or spoke their native language,

88
0:04:37.086,000 --> 0:04:39,000
most of which were orally passed down.

89
0:04:39.892,000 --> 0:04:44,000
As of now, there are 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States,

90
0:04:45.591,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when there used to be countless more.

91
0:04:48.179,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In my father's words,

92
0:04:49.803,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"Being Native is not about wearing long hair in braids.

93
0:04:53.386,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's not about feathers or beadwork.

94
0:04:56.244,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's about the way we all center ourselves in the world as human beings."

95
0:05:01.776,000 --> 0:05:03,000
After traveling with this film for over a year,

96
0:05:04.099,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I met indigenous people from around the world,

97
0:05:06.524,000 --> 0:05:07,000
from the Ainu of Japan,

98
0:05:08.177,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Sami of Scandinavia,

99
0:05:09.651,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the Maori

100
0:05:10.85,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and many more.

101
0:05:12.108,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And they were all dealing with the exact same struggle

102
0:05:15.991,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to preserve their language and culture.

103
0:05:19.168,000 --> 0:05:22,000
At this moment, I not only realize the power storytelling has

104
0:05:22.782,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to connect all of us as human beings

105
0:05:25.198,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but the responsibility that comes with this power.

106
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It can become incredibly dangerous when our stories are rewritten or ignored,

107
0:05:32.802,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because when we are denied identity,

108
0:05:34.812,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we become invisible.

109
0:05:36.89,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We're all storytellers.

110
0:05:39.705,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Reclaiming our narratives and just listening to each other's

111
0:05:44.365,000 --> 0:05:47,000
can create a portal that can transcend time itself.

112
0:05:48.397,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Thank you.

113
0:05:49.604,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

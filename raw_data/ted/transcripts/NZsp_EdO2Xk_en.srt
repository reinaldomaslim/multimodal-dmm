1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to talk to you today about prosperity,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about our hopes

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for a shared and lasting prosperity.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And not just us,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but the two billion people worldwide

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who are still chronically undernourished.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And hope actually is at the heart of this.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In fact, the Latin word for hope

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is at the heart of the word prosperity.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in accordance with our hopes and expectations.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The irony is, though,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that we have cashed-out prosperity

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we've grown our economies so much

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that we now stand

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in a real danger

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
of undermining hope --

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
running down resources, cutting down rainforests,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
changing the climate --

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and the only thing that has actually

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
remotely slowed down the relentless rise

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is recession.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And recession, of course,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as we're busy finding out.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So we're caught in a kind of trap.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We can't live with it; we can't live without it.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Trash the system or crash the planet --

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And our best avenue of escape from this actually

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is a kind of blind faith

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and doing things more efficiently.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I think we are a clever species sometimes.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But I think we should also just check the numbers,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
take a reality check here.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So I want you to imagine a world,

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in 2050, of around nine billion people,

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
all aspiring to Western incomes,

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Western lifestyles.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I want to ask the question --

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because we believe in growth.

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I want to ask the question:

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
how far and how fast would be have to move?

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
How clever would we have to be?

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
How much technology would we need in this world

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to deliver our carbon targets?

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And here in my chart --

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on the left-hand side is where we are now.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in the economy at the moment.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In the world I describe to you,

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
at six grams of carbon.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's a 130-fold improvement,

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and that is 10 times further and faster

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Maybe we can even go further

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which is what we're going to need to be doing

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
by the end of the century.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But shouldn't we just check first

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that the economic system that we have

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is remotely capable of delivering

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
this kind of improvement?

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is sort of human terms.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So it looks a little bit like this.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and provide us with incomes,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
on more goods and services.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That's called the circular flow of the economy.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It looks harmless enough.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which is the role of investment.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now investment constitutes

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
only about a fifth of the national income

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in most modern economies,

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but it plays an absolutely vital role.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And what it does essentially

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is to stimulate further consumption growth.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It does this in a couple of ways --

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
chasing productivity,

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But I want to concentrate

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
on the role of investment

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in seeking out novelty,

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the production and consumption of novelty.

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Joseph Schumpeter called this

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"the process of creative destruction."

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
continually chasing expanding consumer markets,

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
consumer goods, new consumer goods.

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And this, this is where it gets interesting,

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because it turns out that human beings

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
have something of an appetite for novelty.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We love new stuff --

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
new material stuff for sure --

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but also new ideas, new adventures,

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
new experiences.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But the materiality matters too,

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because in every society

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that anthropologists have looked at,

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
material stuff

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
operates as a kind of language --

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a language of goods,

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a symbolic language

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that we use to tell each other stories --

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
stories, for example,

121
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
about how important we are.

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption

123
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
thrives from the language

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of novelty.

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And here, all of a sudden,

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we have a system

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that is locking economic structure with social logic --

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to drive an engine of growth.

130
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this engine is not just economic value;

131
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it is pulling material resources

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
relentlessly through the system,

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
driven by our own insatiable appetites,

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Adam Smith, 200 years ago,

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
spoke about our desire

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
for a life without shame.

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
A life without shame:

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and today, well, you still need the shirt,

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but you need the hybrid car,

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
driven by this anxiety.

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And even if we don't want them,

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we need to buy them,

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And to stop it crashing

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
over the last two to three decades,

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we've expanded the money supply,

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
expanded credit and debt,

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so that people can keep buying stuff.

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But this -- I just want to show you some data here.

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is what it looks like, essentially,

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
this credit and debt system, just for the U.K.

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This was the last 15 years before the crash,

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It was above the GDP for three years in a row

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
just before the crisis.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The savings ratio, net savings,

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
were below zero in the middle of 2008,

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
just before the crash.

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
just to stay in the game.

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is a strange, rather perverse, story,

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
just to put it in very simple terms.

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's a story about us, people,

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
being persuaded

172
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to spend money we don't have

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
on things we don't need

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to create impressions that won't last

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
on people we don't care about.

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But before we consign ourselves to despair,

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?

180
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Is this really how people are?

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Is this really how economies behave?"

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And almost straightaway

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The first one is in the crisis itself.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They want to spend less and save more.

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
from the system point of view.

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
saving slows down recovery.

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And politicians call on us continually

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to draw down more debt,

194
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to draw down our own savings even further,

195
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
just so that we can get the show back on the road,

196
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
so we can keep this growth-based economy going.

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's an anomaly,

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it's a place where the system actually is at odds

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
with who we are as people.

200
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Here's another one -- completely different one:

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Why is it

202
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do

203
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to combat climate change,

204
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
very, very simple things

205
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like buying energy-efficient appliances,

206
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
insulating our homes?

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
These things save carbon, they save energy,

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
they save us money.

210
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,

211
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we don't do them?

212
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, I had my own personal insight into this

213
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a few years ago.

214
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,

215
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it was just after --

216
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
actually, to be honest, too long after --

217
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we had moved into a new house.

218
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,

219
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
installing insulation around the windows and doors

220
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to keep out the drafts.

221
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And my, then, five year-old daughter

222
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.

223
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And we'd been doing this for a while,

224
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
when she turned to me very solemnly and said,

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"

226
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

227
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"Here they are, the giraffes."

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You can hear the five-year-old mind working.

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

231
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.

232
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But actually that childish misrepresentation

233
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
stuck with me,

234
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because it suddenly became clear to me

235
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.

236
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes --

237
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
putting the kids on the bus in the morning,

238
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
getting ourselves to work on time,

239
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
surviving email overload

240
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and shop floor politics,

241
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,

242
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening

243
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
into prime-time TV

244
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
or TED online,

245
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
getting from one end of the day to the other,

246
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
keeping out the giraffes.

247
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

248
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What is the objective?

249
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"What is the objective of the consumer?"

250
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
written 35 years ago.

252
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
"It is," she said,

253
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
"to help create the social world

254
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and find a credible place in it."

255
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That is a deeply humanizing

256
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
vision of our lives,

257
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and it's a completely different vision

258
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than the one that lies at the heart

259
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of this economic model.

260
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So who are we?

261
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Who are these people?

262
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,

263
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
selfish individuals?

264
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Or might we actually occasionally be

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
something like the selfless altruist

266
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?

267
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Well psychology actually says

268
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
there is a tension --

269
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a tension between self-regarding behaviors

270
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and other regarding behaviors.

271
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,

272
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
so selfish behavior

273
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is adaptive in certain circumstances --

274
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
fight or flight.

275
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But other regarding behaviors

276
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
are essential to our evolution

277
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as social beings.

278
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,

279
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors

280
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and tradition or conservation.

281
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing

282
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and you need to adapt yourself.

283
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability

284
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to raise families and form cohesive social groups.

285
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So here, all of a sudden,

286
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we're looking at a map of the human heart.

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And it reveals to us, suddenly,

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the crux of the matter.

289
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What we've done is we've created economies.

290
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We've created systems,

291
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
which systematically privilege, encourage,

292
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
one narrow quadrant

293
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of the human soul

294
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and left the others unregarded.

295
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because this isn't, therefore,

297
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
about changing human nature.

298
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.

299
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It is about opening up.

300
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom

301
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to become fully human,

302
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
recognizing the depth and the breadth

303
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of the human psyche

304
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and building institutions

305
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.

306
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
What does all this mean for economics?

307
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
What would economies look like

308
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
if we took that vision of human nature

309
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
at their heart

310
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and stretched them

311
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
along these orthogonal dimensions

312
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
of the human psyche?

313
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Well, it might look a little bit

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
like the 4,000 community-interest companies

315
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years

316
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,

317
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
enterprises

318
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that have ecological and social goals

319
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
written into their constitution

320
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at their heart --

321
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.

322
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this.

323
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Ecosia is an Internet search engine.

324
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Internet search engines work

325
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
by drawing revenues from sponsored links

326
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that appear when you do a search.

327
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.

328
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So we can do that here --

329
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we can just put in a little search term.

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The difference with Ecosia though

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is that, in Ecosia's case,

333
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it draws the revenues in the same way,

334
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but it allocates

335
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
80 percent of those revenues

336
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.

337
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And we're going to do it.

338
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.

339
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,

340
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that's the page to go to.

341
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And what happened then was

342
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,

343
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues

344
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to a rainforest protection project.

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's taking profits from one place

346
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and allocating them

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
into the protection of ecological resources.

348
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It's a different kind of enterprise

349
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
for a new economy.

350
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It's a form, if you like,

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of ecological altruism --

352
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.

353
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Whatever it is,

354
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
whatever this new economy is,

355
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
what we need the economy to do, in fact,

356
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is to put investment

357
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
back into the heart of the model,

358
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to re-conceive investment.

359
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Only now, investment

360
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
isn't going to be

361
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
about the relentless and mindless

362
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
pursuit of consumption growth.

363
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Investment has to be a different beast.

364
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Investment has to be,

365
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
in the new economy,

366
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
protecting and nurturing

367
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
the ecological assets on which our future depends.

368
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It has to be about transition.

369
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies

370
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and infrastructures.

371
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We have to invest, in fact,

372
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in the idea of a meaningful prosperity,

373
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
providing capabilities

374
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
for people to flourish.

375
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And of course, this task has material dimensions.

376
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing

377
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.

378
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.

379
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It has social and psychological aims --

380
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
family, friendship,

381
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
commitments, society,

382
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
participating in the life of that society.

383
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And this too

384
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
requires investment,

385
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
investment -- for example, in places --

386
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
places where we can connect,

387
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
places where we can participate,

388
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
shared spaces,

389
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
concert halls, gardens,

390
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
public parks,

391
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
libraries, museums, quiet centers,

392
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
places of joy and celebration,

393
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
places of tranquility and contemplation,

394
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
sites for the "cultivation

395
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
of a common citizenship,"

396
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.

397
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept --

398
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
is nothing more nor less

399
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
than a relationship

400
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
between the present and the future,

401
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a shared present and a common future.

402
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And we need that relationship to reflect,

403
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to reclaim hope.

404
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So let me come back, with this sense of hope,

405
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to the two billion people

406
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
still trying to live each day

407
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
on less than the price of a skinny latte

408
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
from the cafe next door.

409
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
What can we offer those people?

410
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It's clear that we have a responsibility

411
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to help lift them out of poverty.

412
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It's clear that we have a responsibility

413
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
to make room for growth

414
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
where growth really matters in those poorest nations.

415
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that

416
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
unless we're capable of redefining

417
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,

418
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
a prosperity that is more meaningful

419
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and less materialistic

420
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
than the growth-based model.

421
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So this is not just

422
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
a Western post-materialist fantasy.

423
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,

424
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
when "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,

425
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
pointing out the similarities

426
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
between this view of prosperity

427
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and the traditional African concept of ubuntu.

428
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Ubuntu says, "I am

429
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
because we are."

430
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Prosperity is a shared endeavor.

431
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Its roots are long and deep --

432
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
its foundations, I've tried to show,

433
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
exist already, inside each of us.

434
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So this is not about

435
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
standing in the way of development.

436
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It's not about

437
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
overthrowing capitalism.

438
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It's not about

439
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
trying to change human nature.

440
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
What we're doing here

441
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
is we're taking a few simple steps

442
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
towards an economics fit for purpose.

443
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And at the heart of that economics,

444
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
we're placing a more credible,

445
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
more robust,

446
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and more realistic vision

447
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
of what it means to be human.

448
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Thank you very much.

449
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Applause)

450
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.

451
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,

452
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
so you may need to work on the tone a little.

453
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
(Laughter)

454
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this?

455
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
I mean, can you picture

456
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
a politician standing up in Britain and saying,

457
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!

458
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,

459
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and our lives are better."

460
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.

461
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
You're not making news out of things falling down.

462
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.

463
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Can I picture politicians doing it?

464
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.

465
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
When we first started this kind of work,

466
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,

467
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.

468
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And actually in the period

469
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
through which we've been working over the last 18 years --

470
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
partly because of the financial crisis

471
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --

472
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
actually people are engaging in this issue

473
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
in all sorts of countries around the world.

474
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,

475
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
or is it going to be more just civil society and companies?

476
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.

477
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
But it has to have political leadership.

478
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
This is a kind of agenda,

479
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
which actually politicians themselves

480
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
are kind of caught in that dilemma,

481
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
because they're hooked on the growth model themselves.

482
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
But actually opening up the space

483
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
to think about different ways of governing,

484
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
different kinds of politics,

485
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and creating the space

486
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
for civil society and businesses to operate differently --

487
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
absolutely vital.

488
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
CA: And if someone could convince you

489
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
that we actually can make the -- what was it? --

490
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
the 130-fold improvement in efficiency,

491
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
of reduction of carbon footprint,

492
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
would you then actually like that picture of economic growth

493
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
into more knowledge-based goods?

494
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that

495
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and get below zero by the end of the century,

496
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,

497
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
and solve the problem of biodiversity

498
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and reduce the impact on land use

499
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.

500
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
If you can convince me we can do all that,

501
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
then, yes, I would take the two percent.

502
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you.

503
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000

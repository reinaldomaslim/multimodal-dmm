1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was listed on the online biography

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that said I was a design missionary.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's a bit lofty; I'm really more

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of something like a street walker.

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I spend a lot of time in urban areas

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
looking for design,

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and studying design in the public sector.

8
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I take about 5,000 photographs a year,

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I thought that I would edit from these,

10
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and try to come up with some images

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that might be appropriate and interesting to you.

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I used three criteria:

13
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the first was, I thought I'd talk about

14
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
real design within reach,

15
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
design that's free, not design not quite within reach,

16
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,

17
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
stuff that was available to all people,

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.

20
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A very common public design done in the '50s.

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,

23
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
very consistent with the Brazilian culture --

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think good design adds to culture.

25
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.

26
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But I think these are my sort of information highways:

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I live in much more of an analog world,

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
where pedestrian traffic and

29
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
interaction and diversity exchange,

30
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and where I think the simple things under our feet

31
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
have a great amount of meaning to us.

32
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
How did I get started in this business?

33
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,

34
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and just loved utilitarian form --

35
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
simple things that we use every day,

36
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
little compositions of color and surface on form.

37
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,

38
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a company dealing with simple forms,

39
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
making good designers available to us,

40
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and also selling the personalities and character of the designers

41
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as well, and it seems to have worked.

42
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
A couple of years into the process,

43
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.

44
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:

45
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I was there going into the design stores,

46
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and mixing with our crowd of designers,

47
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff

48
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization

49
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
has had that in our community also.

50
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,

51
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it's getting increasingly more difficult

52
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to find design that reflects a unique culture.

53
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam

54
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I recognized, you know, the big story

55
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,

56
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's what's out on the streets,

57
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and maybe it's self-explanatory,

58
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,

59
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,

60
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way

61
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in which people get around and where pedestrian rights

62
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are protected.

63
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,

64
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response

65
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that I realized that design, that common design,

66
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that's in the public area means a lot to people,

67
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.

68
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I then kind of thought about the other cities

69
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,

70
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --

71
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,

72
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps

73
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
there was something about these important design centers

74
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,

75
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there

76
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is that there are universities and schools

77
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where people can't afford cars,

78
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but it did seem that in many of these areas

79
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
pedestrian traffic was protected.

80
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:

81
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.

82
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam

83
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and recognized, you know, the first job of design

84
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is to serve a social purpose.

85
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,

86
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but being a very good example of design.

87
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time

88
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in the cities, looking at design

89
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for common evidence of design

90
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.

91
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was in Buenos Aires very recently,

92
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.

93
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He's a Spanish architect and designer.

94
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --

95
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --

96
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and it was a bit of a disappointment,

97
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.

98
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I recognized that oftentimes design,

99
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when you're set up to see design,

100
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it can be a bit of a letdown.

101
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But there were lots of other things going on in this area:

102
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it was a kind of construction zone;

103
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a lot of buildings were going up.

104
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;

105
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition

106
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.

107
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But to me it was an example of

108
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation

109
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.

110
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.

111
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I find these little vignettes,

112
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
these little accidental pieces of design,

113
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to be refreshing.

114
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They give me, I don't know,

115
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a sense of correctness in the world

116
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and some visual delight in the knowledge

117
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that the building will probably never look as good

118
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
as this simple industrial scaffolding

119
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that is there to serve.

120
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:

121
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines

122
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
going across, these magenta squiggles,

123
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,

124
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
just a nice, kind of, breakup

125
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of the urban place.

126
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And, you know, that no longer exists.

127
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's

128
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like listening to little songs or something:

129
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.

130
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Antoine Predock designed

131
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego

132
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
called Petco Park.

133
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
A terrific use of local materials,

134
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but inside you could find some interior compositions.

135
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;

136
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I go and see design relationships.

137
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,

138
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the way that the trees form vertical elements.

139
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Red is a color in the landscape

140
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that is often on stop signs.

141
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;

142
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it stares back at you the way that a figure might.

143
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.

144
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Construction site in New York:

145
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
red having this kind of emotional power

146
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that's almost an equivalent with the way in which --

147
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
cuteness of puppies and such.

148
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Side street in Italy.

149
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Red drew me into this little composition,

150
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
optimistic to me in the sense that maybe

151
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the public service's mailbox,

152
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
door service, plumbing.

153
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It looks as if these different public services

154
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
work together to create some nice little compositions.

155
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.

156
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Simple menus put on a board,

157
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.

158
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But I'm convinced that it's because

159
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you're walking around the streets and seeing things.

160
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention

161
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant

162
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.

163
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Color can animate simple blocks,

164
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
simple materials:

165
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
walking in New York, I'll stop.

166
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I don't always know why I take photographs of things.

167
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
A nice visual composition of symmetry.

168
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Curves against sharp things.

169
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with

170
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
public seating in the city of New York.

171
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I've come across some other just,

172
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
kind of, curious relationships

173
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of bollards on the street that have different interpretations,

174
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but -- these things amuse me.

175
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --

176
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a trash can that's been left there for 18 months

177
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
creates a nice 45-degree angle

178
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
against these other relationships,

179
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.

180
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work

181
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that I see in places that I go.

182
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Havana is a wonderful area.

183
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's quite free of commercial clutter:

184
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you don't see our logos and brands and names,

185
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and therefore you're alert to things physically.

186
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,

187
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.

188
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,

189
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because of the blockades and things,

190
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but a really wonderful playground.

191
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.

192
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In our area, in furnishings,

193
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they're sort of way at the top.

194
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.

195
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I came across this little street in Venice,

196
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
where the communist headquarters

197
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.

198
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place

199
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
where they can accept these different ideologies

200
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and deal with diversity and not have the problem,

201
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or they can choose to ignore them,

202
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but these -- you don't have warring factions,

203
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity

204
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which has made Italy so innovative

205
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and so tolerant.

206
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,

207
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I think that it's recognizable there,

208
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and has an important effect on culture,

209
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because their public spaces are protected,

210
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
their sidewalks are protected,

211
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
and you're actually able to confront these things

212
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
physically,

213
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I think this helps people get over

214
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
their fear of modernism and other such things.

215
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.

216
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I use this -- this is, sort of,

217
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
what I consider to be urban spam.

218
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,

219
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but here, private industry is really kind of

220
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
making a mess of the public sector.

221
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,

222
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the publications that report on problems in the urban area

223
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
also contribute to it,

224
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and it's just my call to say to all of us,

225
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
public policy won't change this at all;

226
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.

227
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The extreme might be in Italy where, again,

228
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
there's kind of some type of control

229
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
over what's happening in the environment is very evident,

230
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.

231
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,

232
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and I come down and park in this little spot.

233
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And I came down one day,

234
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and all the bikes were red.

235
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,

236
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
but this was an actual moment

237
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when I got off my bike,

238
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and I looked and I thought, it's as if

239
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
all of my biker brethren

240
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
had kind of gotten together and conspired

241
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to make a little statement.

242
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And it reminded me that --

243
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to keep in the present,

244
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to look out for these kinds of things.

245
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It gave me possibilities for wonder --

246
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,

247
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and create some installations.

248
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But it also reminded me of the power

249
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of pattern and repetition

250
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to make an effect in our mind.

251
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect

252
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
than pattern and the way it unites

253
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
kind of disparate elements.

254
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I was at the art show in Miami in December,

255
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,

256
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and amazed at the prices of art

257
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.

258
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service

259
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
had created, you know, quite a nice little collage

260
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
of these car keys,

261
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags

262
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that I had seen in Tokyo.

263
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And I thought that if

264
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
pattern can unite these disparate elements,

265
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it can do just about anything.

266
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I don't have very many shots of people,

267
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form.

268
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I was in a small restaurant in Spain,

269
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
having lunch --

270
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
one of those nice days where

271
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you had the place kind of to yourself,

272
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area

273
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and the culture and the food

274
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the quiet, and feeling very lucky,

275
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and a bus load of tourists arrived,

276
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
emptied out,

277
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
filled up the restaurant.

278
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
In a very short period of time,

279
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
completely changed the atmosphere

280
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and character with loud voices and large bodies and such,

281
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we had to get up and leave;

282
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
it was just that uncomfortable.

283
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And at that moment, the sun came out,

284
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and through this perforated screen,

285
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a pattern was cast over these bodies

286
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they kind of faded into the rear,

287
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and we left the restaurant kind of

288
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
feeling O.K. about stuff.

289
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I do think pattern

290
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
has the capability of eradicating

291
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
some of the most evil

292
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
forces of society,

293
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
such as bad form in restaurants,

294
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but quite seriously, it was a statement to me

295
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that one thing that you do, sort of, see

296
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is the aggressive nature

297
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of the industrial world has produced --

298
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
kind of,

299
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
large masses of things,

300
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and when you -- in monoculture,

301
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and I think the preservation of diversity in culture

302
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is something that's important to us.

303
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The last shots that I have deal with --

304
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
coming back to this theme of sidewalks,

305
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and I wanted to

306
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.

307
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Post-Second World War,

308
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the influence of the automobile

309
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.

310
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots

311
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in a sort of indiscriminate use.

312
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated

313
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars

314
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
as it is on Wal-Mart;

315
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I'm not going to do that.

316
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But they're real examples in urbanization

317
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and the change that's occurred in the last number of years,

318
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and the heightened sensitivity to the importance

319
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of our urban environments as cultural centers.

320
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I think that they are, that the statements that we make

321
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in this public sector

322
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are our contributions

323
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to a larger whole.

324
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Cities are the place where we're most likely

325
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to encounter diversity

326
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and to mix with other people.

327
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.

328
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But I think people have recognized

329
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the sanctity of our urban areas.

330
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
A place like Chicago

331
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
has really reached kind of a level of international stature.

332
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of

333
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
enlightened urban planning and renewal,

334
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and I want to single out a place like Chicago,

335
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero

336
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
for being able to work through the

337
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
political processes and all that to improve an area.

338
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
You would expect a city like this to have

339
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
upgraded flower boxes

340
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,

341
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but if you actually go along the street you find

342
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the flower boxes change from street to street:

343
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there's actual diversity in the plants.

344
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And the idea that a city group can maintain

345
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
different types of foliage

346
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is really quite exceptional.

347
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,

348
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and then there are your big-D design statements:

349
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.

350
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
My measure of this as being an important bit of design

351
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is not so much the way that it looks,

352
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but the fact that it performs a very important social function.

353
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
There are a lot of free concerts, for example,

354
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that go on in this area;

355
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
it has a phenomenal acoustic system.

356
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But the commitment that the city has made to the public area

357
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is significant, and almost an international model.

358
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,

359
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
on the International Design Council for Mayors,

360
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,

361
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.

362
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I thought that I should include at least one

363
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
shot of technology for you guys.

364
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,

365
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa

366
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
has created, kind of,

367
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
a digital readout in this park

368
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that reflects back

369
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the characters and personalities

370
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
of the people in this area.

371
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,

372
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
reflective of diversity, and I think

373
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
this marriage of both technology and art

374
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in the public sector is an area where the U.S.

375
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
can really take a leadership role,

376
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and Chicago is one example.

377
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Thank you very much.

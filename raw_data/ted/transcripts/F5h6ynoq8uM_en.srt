1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How do we get people engaged in solving global warming?

2
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'd like to start with running two short experiments with you all.

3
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So your task is to notice if you feel any difference as I speak.

4
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
OK?

5
0:00:30.12,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Here we go.

6
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We are seeing rising carbon dioxide levels,

7
0:00:35.44,000 --> 0:00:37,000
now about 410 ppms.

8
0:00:38.96,000 --> 0:00:4,000
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario,

9
0:00:41.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we need rapid decarbonization.

10
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The global carbon budget

11
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for 66 percent likelihood to meet the two-degree target

12
0:00:50.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is approximately 800 gigatons.

13
0:00:55.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:01:,000
OK, now let me try something else.

15
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We are heading for an uninhabitable earth:

16
0:01:06.52,000 --> 0:01:08,000
monster storms,

17
0:01:08.64,000 --> 0:01:09,000
killer floods,

18
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
devastating wildfires,

19
0:01:12.72,000 --> 0:01:15,000
crazy heat waves that will cook us under a blazing sun.

20
0:01:18.84,000 --> 0:01:21,000
2017 is already so unexpectedly warm,

21
0:01:22.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it's freaking out climate scientists.

22
0:01:24.84,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We have a three-year window to cut emissions, three years.

23
0:01:28.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If not, we will soon live in a boiling earth, a hellhole.

24
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
OK. So --

25
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:39.84,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now your task:

27
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How did these ways of speaking make you feel?

28
0:01:45.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The first, detached maybe or just confused?

29
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What's this guy talking about?

30
0:01:52.04,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The other, fearful or just numb?

31
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So again, the question I asked:

32
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
How do we get people engaged in solving global warming?

33
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And why don't these two ways of communicating work?

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You see, the biggest obstacle to dealing with climate disruptions

35
0:02:10.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
lies between your ears.

36
0:02:13.36,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Building on a rapidly growing body of psychology and social science,

37
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I spent years looking into the five inner defenses

38
0:02:21.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that stop people from engaging.

39
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:26,000
When people hear news about the climate coming straight at them,

40
0:02:27.64,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the first defense comes up rapidly:

41
0:02:31.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
distance.

42
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:34,000
When we hear about the climate,

43
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we hear about something far away in space --

44
0:02:36.72,000 --> 0:02:38,000
think Arctic ice, polar bears --

45
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
far away in time -- think 2100.

46
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's huge and slow-moving -- think gigatons and centuries.

47
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So it's not here. It's not now.

48
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Since it feels so far away from me,

49
0:02:54.72,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it seems outside my circle of influence,

50
0:02:58.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so I feel helpless about it.

51
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's nothing I can do.

52
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
In our everyday lives,

53
0:03:04.44,000 --> 0:03:06,000
most of us prefer to think about nearer things,

54
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:09,000
such as our jobs, our kids,

55
0:03:09.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
how many likes we get on Facebook.

56
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, that, that's real.

57
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Next defense is doom.

58
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Climate change is usually framed

59
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as a looming disaster,

60
0:03:25.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
bringing losses, cost and sacrifice.

61
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That makes us fearful.

62
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But after the first fear is gone,

63
0:03:33.72,000 --> 0:03:36,000
my brain soon wants to avoid this topic altogether.

64
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
After 30 years of scary climate change communications,

65
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
more than 80 percent of media articles still use disaster framings,

66
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but people habituate to and then --

67
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
desensitize

68
0:03:52.84,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to doom overuse.

69
0:03:54.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So many of us are now suffering a kind of apocalypse fatigue,

70
0:03:59.08,000 --> 0:04:01,000
getting numb from too much collapse porn.

71
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The third defense is dissonance.

72
0:04:06.8,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, if what we know,

73
0:04:09.72,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that fossil fuel use contributes to global warming,

74
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
conflicts with what we do -- drive, fly, eat beef --

75
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
then so-called cognitive dissonance sets in.

76
0:04:18.28,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is felt as an inner discomfort.

77
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We may feel like hypocrites.

78
0:04:22.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
To get rid of this discomfort,

79
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
our brain starts coming up with justifications.

80
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I can say, for instance,

81
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"My neighbor, he has a much bigger car than I do."

82
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Or, "Changing my diet doesn't amount to anything

83
0:04:38.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
if I am the only one to do it."

84
0:04:41.72,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Or, I could even want to doubt climate science itself.

85
0:04:45.4,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I could say, "You know, climate is always changing."

86
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So these justifications make us all feel better,

87
0:04:53.96,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but at the expense

88
0:04:56.6,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of dismissing what we know.

89
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Thus, behavior drives attitudes.

90
0:05:03.92,000 --> 0:05:05,000
My personal cognitive dissonance comes up

91
0:05:06.68,000 --> 0:05:09,000
when I recognize that I've been flying from Oslo to New York

92
0:05:10.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and back to Oslo

93
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in order to speak about the climate.

94
0:05:14.24,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For 14 minutes.

96
0:05:17.28,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:21.2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So that makes me want to move on to denial.

98
0:05:23.92,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:26.2,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So if we keep silent,

100
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
ignore or ridicule facts about climate disruptions,

101
0:05:32.08,000 --> 0:05:34,000
then we might find inner refuge

102
0:05:34.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from fear and guilt.

103
0:05:37.2,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Denial doesn't really come from lack of intelligence or knowledge.

104
0:05:40.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
No, denial is a state of mind

105
0:05:44.24,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in which I may be aware of some troubling knowledge,

106
0:05:47.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but I live and act as if I don't know.

107
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So you could call it a kind of double life,

108
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:54,000
both knowing and not knowing,

109
0:05:54.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and often this is reinforced by others,

110
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
my family or community,

111
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:01,000
agreeing not to raise this tricky topic.

112
0:06:03.24,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Finally, identity.

113
0:06:07.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Alarmed climate activists

114
0:06:10.68,000 --> 0:06:12,000
demand that government takes action,

115
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
either with regulation or carbon taxes.

116
0:06:15.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But consider what happens

117
0:06:17.6,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when people who hold conservative values, for instance,

118
0:06:21.36,000 --> 0:06:24,000
hear from an activist that government ought to expand even further.

119
0:06:26.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Particularly in rich Western democracies,

120
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they are then less likely to believe that science.

121
0:06:33.32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
How is that?

122
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance,

123
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I probably prefer big proper cars and small government

124
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.

125
0:06:47.24,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And if climate science comes and then says

126
0:06:50.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
government should expand further,

127
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
then I probably will trust that science less.

128
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:07:,000
In this way, cultural identity

129
0:07:01.32,000 --> 0:07:02,000
starts to override the facts.

130
0:07:03.32,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The values eat the facts,

131
0:07:05.52,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and my identity trumps truth any day.

132
0:07:11.24,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, after recognizing how these five D's kill engagement,

133
0:07:16.28,000 --> 0:07:17,000
how can we move beyond them?

134
0:07:19.24,000 --> 0:07:22,000
New research shows how we can flip these five defenses

135
0:07:22.84,000 --> 0:07:24,000
over into key success criteria

136
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
for a more brain-friendly climate communication.

137
0:07:28.88,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So this is where it gets really exciting

138
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and where we find the five S's,

139
0:07:35.04,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the five evidence-based solutions for what does work.

140
0:07:40.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
First, we can flip distance to social.

141
0:07:43.96,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We can make climate feel near, personal and urgent

142
0:07:47.44,000 --> 0:07:5,000
by bringing it home,

143
0:07:50.52,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and we can do that by spreading social norms

144
0:07:53.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that are positive to solutions.

145
0:07:55.8,000 --> 0:07:57,000
If I believe my friends or neighbors,

146
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you guys, will do something,

147
0:07:59.84,000 --> 0:08:,000
then I will, too.

148
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We can see, for instance, this from rooftop solar panels.

149
0:08:05.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They are spreading from neighbor to neighbor like a virus.

150
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's contagious.

151
0:08:09.68,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This is the power of peer-to-peer creating the new normal.

152
0:08:14.12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Next, we can flip doom to supportive.

153
0:08:17.8,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Rather than backfiring frames

154
0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:21,000
such as disaster and cost,

155
0:08:22.72,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we can reframe climate as being really about human health,

156
0:08:28.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for instance, with plant-based delicious burgers,

157
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:34,000
good for you and good for the climate.

158
0:08:35.28,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We can also reframe climate as being about new tech opportunities,

159
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
about safety and about new jobs.

160
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Solar jobs, for instance, are seeing an amazing growth.

161
0:08:45.64,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They just passed the three million jobs mark.

162
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Psychology says, in order to create engagement,

163
0:08:52.039,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we should present, on balance,

164
0:08:54.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
three positive or supportive framings

165
0:08:58.08,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for each climate threat we mention.

166
0:09:00.68,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Then we can flip dissonance

167
0:09:03.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to simpler actions.

168
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This is often called nudging.

169
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The idea is, by better choice architecture,

170
0:09:12.68,000 --> 0:09:15,000
we can make the climate-friendly behaviors

171
0:09:16.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
default and convenient.

172
0:09:19.48,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste.

173
0:09:22.4,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Food waste at buffets goes way down

174
0:09:25.84,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if the plate or the box size is reduced a little,

175
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because on the smaller plate it looks full

176
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but in the big box it looks half empty,

177
0:09:35.44,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so we put more in.

178
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So smaller plates make a big difference for food waste.

179
0:09:40.48,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And there are hundreds of smart nudges like this.

180
0:09:43.2,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The point is, dissonance goes down as more behaviors are nudged.

181
0:09:47.84,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Then we can flip denial

182
0:09:51.48,000 --> 0:09:54,000
by tailoring signals that visualize our progress.

183
0:09:55.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We can provide motivating feedback

184
0:09:57.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
on how well we're doing with our problem-solving.

185
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Say you improved your transport footprint

186
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:05,000
or cut energy waste in your buildings.

187
0:10:06.48,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Then one app that can share this well is called Ducky.

188
0:10:10.24,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The idea is, you log your actions there,

189
0:10:12.2,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then you can see how well your team or company is doing,

190
0:10:16.04,000 --> 0:10:17,000
so you get real-time signals.

191
0:10:18.72,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Finally, identity.

192
0:10:22.12,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We can flip identity with better stories.

193
0:10:25.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Our brain loves stories.

194
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So we need better stories of where we all want to go,

195
0:10:31.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and we need more stories of the heroes and heroines

196
0:10:34.24,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of all stripes that are making real change happen.

197
0:10:39.56,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I'm proud that my hometown of Oslo

198
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is now embarking on a bold journey of electrifying all transport,

199
0:10:47.68,000 --> 0:10:49,000
whether cars, bikes or buses.

200
0:10:51.24,000 --> 0:10:53,000
One of the people spearheading this is Christina Bu.

201
0:10:54.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
She is heading the Electric Vehicle Association for years

202
0:10:58.52,000 --> 0:11:,000
and she has been fighting every day.

203
0:11:00.56,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, the UK and France, India and China have also announced plans

204
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
for ending the sales of fossil cars.

205
0:11:07.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now, that's massive.

206
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And in Oslo, we can see how enthusiastic EV owners

207
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
go and tell their electric stories to friends and neighbors

208
0:11:18.28,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and bring them along.

209
0:11:19.6,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So we come full circle from story back to social.

210
0:11:25.52,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So thousands of climate communicators

211
0:11:28.72,000 --> 0:11:3,000
are now starting to use these solutions

212
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
all over the world.

213
0:11:32.8,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It is clear, however, that individual solutions

214
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:38,000
are not sufficient to solving climate alone,

215
0:11:39.92,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but they do build stronger bottom-up support

216
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
for policies and solutions that can.

217
0:11:49.24,000 --> 0:11:51,000
That is why engaging people is so crucial.

218
0:11:54.12,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I started this talk

219
0:11:56.32,000 --> 0:11:59,000
with testing two ways of communicating climate with you.

220
0:12:01.72,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There is another way, too,

221
0:12:03.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I'd like to share with you.

222
0:12:05.8,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It starts with reimagining climate itself

223
0:12:08.56,000 --> 0:12:09,000
as the living air.

224
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Climate isn't really about some abstract, distant climate

225
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:15,000
far, far away from us.

226
0:12:15.28,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's about this air that surrounds us.

227
0:12:18.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This air, you can feel in this room, too,

228
0:12:21.8,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the air that moves right now in your nostrils.

229
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This air is our earth's skin.

230
0:12:29.32,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's amazingly thin,

231
0:12:31.44,000 --> 0:12:35,000
compared to the size of the earth and the cosmos it shields us from,

232
0:12:36.12,000 --> 0:12:38,000
far thinner than the skin of an apple

233
0:12:38.64,000 --> 0:12:39,000
compared to its diameter.

234
0:12:41.84,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It may look infinite when we look up,

235
0:12:45.28,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but the beautiful, breathable air is only like five to seven miles thin,

236
0:12:50.44,000 --> 0:12:53,000
a fragile wrapping around a massive ball.

237
0:12:55.64,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Inside this skin,

238
0:12:57.52,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we're all closely connected.

239
0:13:00.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The breath that you just took

240
0:13:03.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
contained around 400,000 of the same argon atoms

241
0:13:08.12,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime.

242
0:13:12.96,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Inside this thin, fluctuating, unsettled film,

243
0:13:16.44,000 --> 0:13:19,000
all of life is nourished, protected and held.

244
0:13:21.44,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It insulates and regulates temperatures

245
0:13:23.4,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in a range that is just right for water and for life as we know it,

246
0:13:27.44,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and mediating between the blue ocean and black eternity,

247
0:13:31.44,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the clouds carry all the billions of tons of water

248
0:13:34.48,000 --> 0:13:35,000
needed for the soils.

249
0:13:36.48,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The air fills the rivers,

250
0:13:39.4,000 --> 0:13:4,000
stirs the waters,

251
0:13:41.04,000 --> 0:13:42,000
waters the forests.

252
0:13:42.92,000 --> 0:13:44,000
With a global weirding of the weather,

253
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:49,000
there are good reasons for feeling fear and despair,

254
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:56,000
yet we may first grieve today's sorry state and losses

255
0:13:56.48,000 --> 0:14:,000
and then turn to face the future with sober eyes and determination.

256
0:14:02.64,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The new psychology of climate action

257
0:14:05.72,000 --> 0:14:07,000
lies in letting go, not of science,

258
0:14:08.56,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but of the crutches of abstractions and doomism,

259
0:14:12.6,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and then choosing to tell the new stories.

260
0:14:15.64,000 --> 0:14:16,000
These are the stories

261
0:14:17.48,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of how we achieve drawdown, the reversing of global warming.

262
0:14:20.84,000 --> 0:14:23,000
These are the stories of the steps we take

263
0:14:25.08,000 --> 0:14:28,000
as peoples, cities, companies

264
0:14:28.92,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and public bodies

265
0:14:30.32,000 --> 0:14:31,000
in caring for the air

266
0:14:32.24,000 --> 0:14:34,000
in spite of strong headwinds.

267
0:14:36.04,000 --> 0:14:38,000
These are the stories of the steps we take

268
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
because they ground us in what we are as humans:

269
0:14:42.84,000 --> 0:14:46,000
earthlings inside this living air.

270
0:14:48.64,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Thank you.

271
0:14:49.88,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

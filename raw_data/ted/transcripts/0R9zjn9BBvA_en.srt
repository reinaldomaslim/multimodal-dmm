1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm an artist.

2
0:00:15.24,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Being an artist is the greatest job there is.

3
0:00:18.76,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I really pity each and every one of you

4
0:00:21.08,000 --> 0:00:23,000
who has to spend your days discovering new galaxies

5
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or saving humanity from global warming.

6
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But being an artist is also a daunting job.

8
0:00:32.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I spend every day, from nine to six, doing this.

9
0:00:37.2,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I even started a side career that consists entirely

11
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of complaining about the difficulty of the creative process.

12
0:00:45.96,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But today, I don't want to talk about what makes my life difficult.

14
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I want to talk about what makes it easy.

15
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And that is you --

16
0:00:55.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and the fact that you are fluent in a language

17
0:00:58.32,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that you're probably not even aware of.

18
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You're fluent in the language of reading images.

19
0:01:06.72,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Deciphering an image like that

20
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
takes quite a bit of an intellectual effort.

21
0:01:10.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But nobody ever taught you how this works,

22
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you just know it.

23
0:01:15.28,000 --> 0:01:17,000
College, shopping, music.

24
0:01:17.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What makes a language powerful is that you can take a very complex idea

25
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and communicate it in a very simple, efficient form.

26
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
These images represent exactly the same ideas.

27
0:01:30.68,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But when you look, for example, at the college hat,

28
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:36,000
you know that this doesn't represent the accessory you wear on your head

29
0:01:36.56,000 --> 0:01:37,000
when you're being handed your diploma,

30
0:01:38.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but rather the whole idea of college.

31
0:01:42.04,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, what drawings can do is they cannot only communicate images,

32
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
they can even evoke emotions.

33
0:01:49.04,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Let's say you get to an unfamiliar place and you see this.

34
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You feel happiness and relief.

35
0:01:53.96,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:55.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
Or a slight sense of unease or maybe downright panic.

37
0:02:01.2,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:03.76,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Or blissful peace and quiet.

39
0:02:07.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But visuals, they're of course more than just graphic icons.

41
0:02:13.36,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You know, if I want to tell the story of modern-day struggle,

42
0:02:16.76,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I would start with the armrest between two airplane seats

43
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and two sets of elbows fighting.

44
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What I love there is this universal law

45
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that, you know, you have 30 seconds to fight it out

46
0:02:27.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and once it's yours, you get to keep it for the rest of the flight.

47
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now, commercial flight is full of these images.

49
0:02:36.76,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If I want to illustrate the idea of discomfort,

50
0:02:40.28,000 --> 0:02:41,000
nothing better than these neck pillows.

51
0:02:42.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They're designed to make you more comfortable --

52
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:47.12,000 --> 0:02:48,000
except they don't.

54
0:02:48.36,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So I never sleep on airplanes.

56
0:02:54.88,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What I do occasionally is I fall into a sort of painful coma.

57
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And when I wake up from that,

58
0:03:02.52,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I have the most terrible taste in my mouth.

59
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's a taste that's so bad, it cannot be described with words,

60
0:03:08.56,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but it can be drawn.

61
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The thing is, you know, I love sleeping.

63
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And when I sleep, I really prefer to do it while spooning.

64
0:03:22.92,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've been spooning on almost a pro level for close to 20 years,

65
0:03:26.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but in all this time, I've never figured out

66
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:3,000
what to do with that bottom arm.

67
0:03:31.48,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Applause)

69
0:03:36.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And the only thing --

70
0:03:39.64,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the only thing that makes sleeping even more complicated

71
0:03:42.52,000 --> 0:03:43,000
than trying to do it on an airplane

72
0:03:44.24,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is when you have small children.

73
0:03:47.04,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They show up at your bed at around 4am

74
0:03:50.04,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with some bogus excuse of, "I had a bad dream."

75
0:03:53.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then, of course you feel sorry for them, they're your kids,

77
0:03:58.52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so you let them into your bed.

78
0:03:59.96,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I have to admit, at the beginning, they're really cute and warm and snugly.

79
0:04:03.685,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The minute you fall back asleep, they inexplicably --

80
0:04:06.88,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:08.56,000 --> 0:04:09,000
start rotating.

82
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:12.44,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We like to call this the helicopter mode.

84
0:04:14.417,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:16.28,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now, the deeper something is etched into your consciousness,

86
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the fewer details we need to have an emotional reaction.

87
0:04:25.36,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:28.24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So why does an image like this work?

89
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It works, because we as readers

90
0:04:33.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
are incredibly good at filling in the blanks.

91
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, when you draw, there's this concept of negative space.

92
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And the idea is, that instead of drawing the actual object,

93
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you draw the space around it.

94
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So the bowls in this drawing are empty.

95
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But the black ink prompts your brain to project food into a void.

96
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:59,000
What we see here is not a owl flying.

97
0:05:00.113,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What we actually see is a pair of AA batteries

98
0:05:02.28,000 --> 0:05:04,000
standing on a nonsensical drawing,

99
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I animate the scene by moving my desk lamp up and down.

100
0:05:08.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:10.12,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The image really only exists in your mind.

102
0:05:13.64,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, how much information do we need to trigger such an image?

103
0:05:18.04,000 --> 0:05:22,000
My goal as an artist is to use the smallest amount possible.

104
0:05:23.12,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I try to achieve a level of simplicity

105
0:05:25.96,000 --> 0:05:27,000
where, if you were to take away one more element,

106
0:05:28.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the whole concept would just collapse.

107
0:05:31.52,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that's why my personal favorite tool as an artist is abstraction.

108
0:05:36.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I've come up with this system which I call the abstract-o-meter,

109
0:05:39.56,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and this is how it works.

110
0:05:40.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So you take a symbol, any symbol, for example the heart and the arrow,

111
0:05:44.84,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which most of us would read as the symbol for love,

112
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I'm an artist, so I can draw this

113
0:05:49.52,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in any given degree of realism or abstraction.

114
0:05:53.32,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now, if I go too realistic on it, it just grosses everybody out.

115
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:59.76,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If I go too far on the other side and do very abstract,

117
0:06:03.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
nobody has any idea what they're looking at.

118
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So I have to find the perfect place on that scale,

119
0:06:08.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in this case it's somewhere in the middle.

120
0:06:11.32,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, once we have reduced an image to a more simple form,

121
0:06:16.08,000 --> 0:06:18,000
all sorts of new connections become possible.

122
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And that allows for totally new angles in storytelling.

123
0:06:24.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so, what I like to do is,

125
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I like to take images from really remote cultural areas and bring them together.

126
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, with more daring references --

127
0:06:38.4,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I can have more fun.

129
0:06:43.56,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But of course, I know that eventually things become so obscure

130
0:06:46.56,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that I start losing some of you.

131
0:06:48.48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding

132
0:06:53.12,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.

133
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
With this image here, a comment on the Olympics in Athens,

134
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I assumed that the reader of the "New Yorker"

135
0:07:05.4,000 --> 0:07:07,000
would have some rudimentary idea of Greek art.

136
0:07:08.36,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If you don't, the image doesn't work.

137
0:07:10.88,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But if you do, you might even appreciate the small detail,

138
0:07:13.64,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like the beer-can pattern here on the bottom of the vase.

139
0:07:16.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:23,000
A recurring discussion I have with magazine editors,

141
0:07:23.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who are usually word people,

142
0:07:25.76,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is that their audience, you,

143
0:07:29.32,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are much better at making radical leaps with images

144
0:07:32.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
than they're being given credit for.

145
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And the only thing I find frustrating is that they often seem to push me

146
0:07:39.56,000 --> 0:07:42,000
towards a small set of really tired visual clichés

147
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that are considered safe.

148
0:07:44.8,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You know, it's the businessman climbing up a ladder,

149
0:07:47.8,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and then the ladder moves, morphs into a stock market graph,

150
0:07:50.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and anything with dollar signs; that's always good.

151
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
If there are editorial decision makers here in the audience,

153
0:07:58.84,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I want to give you a piece of advice.

154
0:08:00.64,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Every time a drawing like this is published,

155
0:08:03.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
a baby panda will die.

156
0:08:05.44,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:06.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Literally.

158
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Applause)

160
0:08:13.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When is a visual cliché good or bad?

161
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's a fine line.

162
0:08:18.92,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it really depends on the story.

163
0:08:21.24,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In 2011, during the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan,

164
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I was thinking of a cover.

165
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And I went through the classic symbols:

166
0:08:29.68,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the Japanese flag,

167
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"The Great Wave" by Hokusai, one of the greatest drawings ever.

168
0:08:35.52,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And then the story changed

169
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
when the situation at the power plant in Fukushima got out of hand.

170
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I remember these TV images of the workers in hazmat suits,

171
0:08:46.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
just walking through the site,

172
0:08:48.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and what struck me was how quiet and serene it was.

173
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And so I wanted to create an image of a silent catastrophe.

174
0:08:56.2,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And that's the image I came up with.

175
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Applause)

176
0:09:00.76,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Thank you.

177
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:05.28,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What I want to do is create an aha moment, for you, for the reader.

179
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And unfortunately, that does not mean

180
0:09:12.04,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that I have an aha moment when I create these images.

181
0:09:15.52,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I never sit at my desk

182
0:09:16.8,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with the proverbial light bulb going off in my head.

183
0:09:21.2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
What it takes is actually a very slow,

184
0:09:24.04,000 --> 0:09:27,000
unsexy process of minimal design decisions

185
0:09:27.48,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that then, when I'm lucky, lead to a good idea.

186
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So one day, I'm on a train, and I'm trying to decode

187
0:09:34.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the graphic rules for drops on a window.

188
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And eventually I realize,

189
0:09:38.8,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"Oh, it's the background blurry upside-down,

190
0:09:42.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
contained in a sharp image."

191
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I thought, wow, that's really cool,

192
0:09:45.61,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I have absolutely no idea what to do with that.

193
0:09:48.016,000 --> 0:09:5,000
A while later, I'm back in New York,

194
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and I draw this image of being stuck on the Brooklyn bridge in a traffic jam.

195
0:09:55.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's really annoying, but also kind of poetic.

196
0:09:58.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And only later I realized,

197
0:10:00.24,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I can take both of these ideas and put them together in this idea.

198
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And what I want to do is not show a realistic scene.

199
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But, maybe like poetry,

200
0:10:11.76,000 --> 0:10:14,000
make you aware that you already had this image with you,

201
0:10:15.24,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but only now I've unearthed it

202
0:10:17.12,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and made you realize that you were carrying it with you all along.

203
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But like poetry, this is a very delicate process

204
0:10:25.12,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that is neither efficient nor scalable, I think.

205
0:10:30.72,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And maybe the most important skill for an artist

206
0:10:34.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is really empathy.

207
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You need craft and you need --

208
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:41.28,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you need creativity --

210
0:10:42.56,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:44.12,000 --> 0:10:45,000
thank you --

212
0:10:45.36,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to come up with an image like that.

213
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But then you need to step back

214
0:10:49.8,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and look at what you've done from the perspective of the reader.

215
0:10:53.92,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.

216
0:10:59.28,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And for that, I started an exercise for myself

217
0:11:01.64,000 --> 0:11:03,000
which I call Sunday sketching,

218
0:11:03.88,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which meant, on a Sunday, I would take a random object I found around the house

219
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and try to see if that object could trigger an idea

220
0:11:13.44,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that had nothing to do with the original purpose of that item.

221
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And it usually just means I'm blank for a long while.

222
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And the only trick that eventually works is if I open my mind

223
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and run through every image I have stored up there,

224
0:11:28.08,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and see if something clicks.

225
0:11:30.64,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And if it does, just add a few lines of ink to connect --

226
0:11:35.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to preserve this very short moment of inspiration.

227
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And the great lesson there

228
0:11:42.52,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was that the real magic doesn't happen on paper.

229
0:11:45.76,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It happens in the mind of the viewer.

230
0:11:48.32,000 --> 0:11:53,000
When your expectations and your knowledge clash with my artistic intentions.

231
0:11:55.96,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Your interaction with an image,

232
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:02,000
your ability to read, question, be bothered or bored or inspired

233
0:12:03.2,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by an image

234
0:12:04.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is as important as my artistic contribution.

235
0:12:07.96,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Because that's what turns an artistic statement

236
0:12:13.72,000 --> 0:12:14,000
really, into a creative dialogue.

237
0:12:17.04,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And so, your skill at reading images

238
0:12:19.52,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is not only amazing,

239
0:12:21.56,000 --> 0:12:22,000
it is what makes my art possible.

240
0:12:24.88,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And for that, I thank you very much.

241
0:12:27.36,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Applause)

242
0:12:30.48,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Cheers)

243
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Thank you.

244
0:12:37.24,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

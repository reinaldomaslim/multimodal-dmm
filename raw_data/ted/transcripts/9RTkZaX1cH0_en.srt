1
0:00:12.943,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm really glad to be here.

2
0:00:15.015,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm glad you're here,

3
0:00:16.727,000 --> 0:00:17,000
because that would be a little weird.

4
0:00:19.46,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm glad we're all here.

5
0:00:22.303,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And by "here," I don't mean here.

6
0:00:26.831,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Or here.

7
0:00:28.728,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But here.

8
0:00:29.904,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I mean Earth.

9
0:00:31.627,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And by "we," I don't mean those of us in this auditorium,

10
0:00:35.594,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but life,

11
0:00:37.088,000 --> 0:00:38,000
all life on Earth --

12
0:00:38.561,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:44.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from complex to single-celled,

14
0:00:46.295,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from mold to mushrooms

15
0:00:48.643,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to flying bears.

16
0:00:50.045,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:53.736,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The interesting thing is,

18
0:00:55.269,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Earth is the only place we know of that has life --

19
0:00:58.324,000 --> 0:00:59,000
8.7 million species.

20
0:01:00.66,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We've looked other places,

21
0:01:01.938,000 --> 0:01:03,000
maybe not as hard as we should or we could,

22
0:01:04.059,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but we've looked and haven't found any;

23
0:01:06.01,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Earth is the only place we know of with life.

24
0:01:09.318,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Is Earth special?

25
0:01:11.591,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is a question I've wanted to know the answer to

26
0:01:14.069,000 --> 0:01:15,000
since I was a small child,

27
0:01:15.347,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium

28
0:01:17.403,000 --> 0:01:2,000
has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer.

29
0:01:20.879,000 --> 0:01:22,000
To understand whether there are any planets --

30
0:01:23.07,000 --> 0:01:25,000
out there in our solar system or beyond --

31
0:01:25.372,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that can support life,

32
0:01:26.854,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the first step is to understand what life here requires.

33
0:01:30.575,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species,

34
0:01:34.162,000 --> 0:01:36,000
life only needs three things.

35
0:01:37.032,000 --> 0:01:39,000
On one side, all life on Earth needs energy.

36
0:01:39.908,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Complex life like us derives our energy from the sun,

37
0:01:43.417,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but life deep underground can get its energy

38
0:01:45.542,000 --> 0:01:46,000
from things like chemical reactions.

39
0:01:47.288,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There are a number of different energy sources

40
0:01:49.463,000 --> 0:01:5,000
available on all planets.

41
0:01:51.4,000 --> 0:01:52,000
On the other side,

42
0:01:52.58,000 --> 0:01:54,000
all life needs food or nourishment.

43
0:01:55.741,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And this seems like a tall order, especially if you want a succulent tomato.

44
0:02:00.239,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:01.979,000 --> 0:02:04,000
However, all life on Earth derives its nourishment

46
0:02:05.069,000 --> 0:02:07,000
from only six chemical elements,

47
0:02:07.123,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and these elements can be found on any planetary body

48
0:02:10.151,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in our solar system.

49
0:02:12.537,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole,

50
0:02:15.788,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the thing that's hardest to achieve.

51
0:02:17.766,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Not moose, but water.

52
0:02:19.682,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:23.285,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Although moose would be pretty cool.

54
0:02:25.103,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:26.285,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And not frozen water, and not water in a gaseous state, but liquid water.

56
0:02:32.748,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is what life needs to survive, all life.

57
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And many solar system bodies don't have liquid water,

58
0:02:39.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so we don't look there.

59
0:02:40.7,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water,

60
0:02:43.717,000 --> 0:02:44,000
even more than Earth,

61
0:02:45.076,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,

62
0:02:47.55,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and so it's hard to access, it's hard to get to,

63
0:02:49.835,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it's hard to even find out if there's any life there.

64
0:02:53.475,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about.

65
0:02:56.494,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So let's make the problem simpler for ourselves.

66
0:02:58.947,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Let's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet.

67
0:03:02.312,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system,

68
0:03:05.292,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet,

69
0:03:07.898,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.

70
0:03:13.265,000 --> 0:03:16,000
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid.

71
0:03:16.661,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You have to be very careful with that atmosphere.

72
0:03:19.063,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You can't have too much atmosphere, too thick or too warm an atmosphere,

73
0:03:22.499,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because then you end up too hot like Venus,

74
0:03:25.428,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and you can't have liquid water.

75
0:03:27.189,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But if you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold,

76
0:03:31.166,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you end up like Mars, too cold.

77
0:03:33.865,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,

78
0:03:36.364,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and Earth is just right.

79
0:03:37.552,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically

80
0:03:41.051,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where life can survive in our solar system.

81
0:03:44.296,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's a Goldilocks-type problem,

82
0:03:45.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and it's so simple that a child could understand it.

83
0:03:49.452,000 --> 0:03:5,000
However,

84
0:03:51.45,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'd like to remind you of two things

85
0:03:54.402,000 --> 0:03:56,000
from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often

86
0:03:57.38,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but that I think are really relevant here.

87
0:04:00.056,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Number one:

88
0:04:02.311,000 --> 0:04:04,000
if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold

89
0:04:05.833,000 --> 0:04:07,000
when Goldilocks walks into the room,

90
0:04:08.642,000 --> 0:04:1,000
does that mean it's always been too cold?

91
0:04:11.825,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Or could it have been just right at some other time?

92
0:04:15.65,000 --> 0:04:18,000
When Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer

93
0:04:19.355,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that we get in the story.

94
0:04:21.114,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And the same is true with planets.

95
0:04:22.868,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They're not static things. They change.

96
0:04:24.918,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They vary. They evolve.

97
0:04:26.684,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And atmospheres do the same.

98
0:04:28.751,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So let me give you an example.

99
0:04:30.477,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Here's one of my favorite pictures of Mars.

100
0:04:32.503,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's not the highest resolution image, it's not the sexiest image,

101
0:04:35.658,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it's not the most recent image,

102
0:04:37.185,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but it's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet;

103
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:43,000
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;

104
0:04:45.515,000 --> 0:04:49,000
riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form.

105
0:04:50.425,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This can't happen on Mars today.

106
0:04:52.067,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold

107
0:04:54.572,000 --> 0:04:56,000
for water to be stable as a liquid.

108
0:04:56.737,000 --> 0:05:,000
This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed,

109
0:05:01.109,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it changed in big ways.

110
0:05:03.714,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable,

111
0:05:08.547,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because the three requirements for life were present long ago.

112
0:05:13.049,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Where did that atmosphere go

113
0:05:15.141,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that allowed water to be liquid at the surface?

114
0:05:17.985,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Well, one idea is it escaped away to space.

115
0:05:21.356,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free

116
0:05:24.047,000 --> 0:05:25,000
from the gravity of the planet,

117
0:05:25.724,000 --> 0:05:27,000
escaping away to space, never to return.

118
0:05:28.437,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres.

119
0:05:31.149,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Comets have tails

120
0:05:32.345,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape.

121
0:05:35.626,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time,

122
0:05:39.059,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and Mars and Earth as well.

123
0:05:40.743,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale.

124
0:05:44.092,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So we'd like to figure out how much escaped over time

125
0:05:46.792,000 --> 0:05:48,000
so we can explain this transition.

126
0:05:48.932,000 --> 0:05:5,000
How do atmospheres get their energy for escape?

127
0:05:51.567,000 --> 0:05:53,000
How do particles get enough energy to escape?

128
0:05:53.722,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There are two ways, if we're going to reduce things a little bit.

129
0:05:56.931,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Number one, sunlight.

130
0:05:58.106,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles

131
0:06:01.542,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and warm the particles.

132
0:06:03.28,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --

133
0:06:05.412,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:07.693,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.

135
0:06:09.629,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:11.145,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They get enough energy to escape and break free

137
0:06:14.172,000 --> 0:06:16,000
from the gravity of the planet just by warming.

138
0:06:16.696,000 --> 0:06:19,000
A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind.

139
0:06:19.882,000 --> 0:06:24,000
These are particles, mass, material, spit out from the surface of the sun,

140
0:06:24.932,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and they go screaming through the solar system

141
0:06:27.36,000 --> 0:06:28,000
at 400 kilometers per second,

142
0:06:29.169,000 --> 0:06:31,000
sometimes faster during solar storms,

143
0:06:31.787,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and they go hurtling through interplanetary space

144
0:06:34.533,000 --> 0:06:36,000
towards planets and their atmospheres,

145
0:06:37.003,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they may provide energy

146
0:06:38.652,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for atmospheric particles to escape as well.

147
0:06:41.182,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is something that I'm interested in,

148
0:06:43.175,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because it relates to habitability.

149
0:06:45.378,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story

150
0:06:48.534,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about,

151
0:06:51.542,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the second one is a little bit more subtle.

152
0:06:53.805,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,

153
0:06:58.18,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,

154
0:07:03.057,000 --> 0:07:06,000
shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder

155
0:07:07.081,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if we're following the trend?

156
0:07:10.195,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This thing that you've accepted your entire life,

157
0:07:12.531,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when you think about it a little bit more, may not be so simple.

158
0:07:16.513,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And of course, distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature.

159
0:07:20.565,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This has to play into habitability.

160
0:07:22.855,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about.

161
0:07:25.809,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Maybe it's the bowls themselves

162
0:07:27.449,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story,

163
0:07:30.529,000 --> 0:07:31,000
what is just right.

164
0:07:32.765,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics

165
0:07:35.654,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of these three planets

166
0:07:36.829,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that may influence habitability,

167
0:07:38.422,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but for selfish reasons related to my own research

168
0:07:41.04,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the fact that I'm standing up here holding the clicker and you're not --

169
0:07:44.652,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:45.682,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I would like to talk for just a minute or two

171
0:07:47.815,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about magnetic fields.

172
0:07:49.715,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.

173
0:07:52.825,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet

174
0:07:55.972,000 --> 0:07:58,000
by electrically conducting churning fluid material

175
0:07:59.713,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth.

176
0:08:02.642,000 --> 0:08:04,000
If you have a compass, you know which way north is.

177
0:08:05.062,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Venus and Mars don't have that.

178
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:07,000
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,

179
0:08:08.518,000 --> 0:08:09,000
congratulations, you're lost.

180
0:08:09.938,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:11.865,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Does this influence habitability?

182
0:08:15.175,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Well, how might it?

183
0:08:17.024,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet

184
0:08:19.652,000 --> 0:08:21,000
serves as a shield for the atmosphere,

185
0:08:22.071,000 --> 0:08:25,000
deflecting solar wind particles around the planet

186
0:08:25.45,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in a bit of a force field-type effect

187
0:08:27.289,000 --> 0:08:29,000
having to do with electric charge of those particles.

188
0:08:30.362,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.

189
0:08:34.013,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:36.962,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And yes, my colleagues who watch this later will realize

191
0:08:40.367,000 --> 0:08:42,000
this is the first time in the history of our community

192
0:08:42.935,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that the solar wind has been equated with mucus.

193
0:08:45.238,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:48.978,000 --> 0:08:51,000
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth may have been protected

195
0:08:52.477,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for billions of years,

196
0:08:53.67,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because we've had a magnetic field.

197
0:08:55.544,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.

198
0:08:57.747,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Mars, on the other hand, has been unprotected

199
0:08:59.878,000 --> 0:09:,000
because of its lack of magnetic field,

200
0:09:01.744,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and over billions of years,

201
0:09:03.72,000 --> 0:09:05,000
maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away

202
0:09:05.924,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to account for a transition from a habitable planet

203
0:09:08.541,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to the planet that we see today.

204
0:09:11.059,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Other scientists think that magnetic fields

205
0:09:14.072,000 --> 0:09:16,000
may act more like the sails on a ship,

206
0:09:16.958,000 --> 0:09:21,000
enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind

207
0:09:22.019,000 --> 0:09:25,000
than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself.

208
0:09:25.315,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The sails may gather energy from the solar wind.

209
0:09:27.83,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind

210
0:09:30.52,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen.

211
0:09:33.788,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's an idea that has to be tested,

212
0:09:36.066,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but the effect and how it works

213
0:09:37.975,000 --> 0:09:38,000
seems apparent.

214
0:09:39.15,000 --> 0:09:4,000
That's because we know

215
0:09:40.325,000 --> 0:09:43,000
energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere

216
0:09:43.424,000 --> 0:09:44,000
here on Earth.

217
0:09:44.599,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That energy is conducted along magnetic field lines

218
0:09:47.028,000 --> 0:09:48,000
down into the polar regions,

219
0:09:48.4,000 --> 0:09:5,000
resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.

220
0:09:50.56,000 --> 0:09:52,000
If you've ever experienced them, it's magnificent.

221
0:09:53.24,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We know the energy is getting in.

222
0:09:55.27,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We're trying to measure how many particles are getting out

223
0:09:58.327,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way.

224
0:10:02.722,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So I've posed a problem for you here,

225
0:10:05.126,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but I don't have a solution yet.

226
0:10:06.696,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We don't have a solution.

227
0:10:08.702,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But we're working on it. How are we working on it?

228
0:10:11.083,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, we've sent spacecraft to all three planets.

229
0:10:13.405,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Some of them are orbiting now,

230
0:10:14.905,000 --> 0:10:17,000
including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars,

231
0:10:18.001,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which I'm involved with and which is led here,

232
0:10:21.557,000 --> 0:10:22,000
out of the University of Colorado.

233
0:10:23.39,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's designed to measure atmospheric escape.

234
0:10:26.022,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth.

235
0:10:28.953,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Once we have all our measurements,

236
0:10:30.642,000 --> 0:10:32,000
we can combine all these together, and we can understand

237
0:10:33.541,000 --> 0:10:36,000
how all three planets interact with their space environment,

238
0:10:36.982,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with the surroundings.

239
0:10:38.168,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability

240
0:10:41.714,000 --> 0:10:42,000
or not.

241
0:10:42.896,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Once we have that answer, why should you care?

242
0:10:45.185,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I mean, I care deeply ...

243
0:10:48.128,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And financially as well, but deeply.

244
0:10:50.158,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:52.763,000 --> 0:10:53,000
First of all, an answer to this question

246
0:10:54.705,000 --> 0:10:56,000
will teach us more about these three planets,

247
0:10:56.832,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Venus, Earth and Mars,

248
0:10:58.016,000 --> 0:11:,000
not only about how they interact with their environment today,

249
0:11:00.951,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but how they were billions of years ago,

250
0:11:02.902,000 --> 0:11:04,000
whether they were habitable long ago or not.

251
0:11:04.988,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It will teach us about atmospheres

252
0:11:06.656,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that surround us and that are close.

253
0:11:09.127,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But moreover, what we learn from these planets

254
0:11:11.335,000 --> 0:11:13,000
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,

255
0:11:14.485,000 --> 0:11:16,000
including planets that we're now observing around other stars.

256
0:11:17.422,000 --> 0:11:18,000
For example, the Kepler spacecraft,

257
0:11:19.201,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which is built and controlled here in Boulder,

258
0:11:22.433,000 --> 0:11:25,000
has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky

259
0:11:25.742,000 --> 0:11:26,000
for a couple years now,

260
0:11:27.013,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it's found thousands of planets --

261
0:11:29.265,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky

262
0:11:32.202,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that we don't think is any different from any other part of the sky.

263
0:11:36.815,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We've gone, in 20 years,

264
0:11:38.649,000 --> 0:11:42,000
from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system,

265
0:11:42.71,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to now having so many,

266
0:11:44.487,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that we don't know which ones to investigate first.

267
0:11:49.269,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Any lever will help.

268
0:11:52.539,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In fact, based on observations that Kepler's taken

269
0:11:56.147,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and other similar observations,

270
0:11:58.3,000 --> 0:11:59,000
we now believe that,

271
0:11:59.493,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone,

272
0:12:04.786,000 --> 0:12:08,000
on average, every star has at least one planet.

273
0:12:10.819,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In addition to that,

274
0:12:12.346,000 --> 0:12:17,000
estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion

275
0:12:18.071,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of those planets that we would define as habitable

276
0:12:23.139,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in just our galaxy.

277
0:12:26.59,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We have the observations of those planets,

278
0:12:28.651,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but we just don't know which ones are habitable yet.

279
0:12:31.159,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot --

280
0:12:34.789,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

281
0:12:35.984,000 --> 0:12:36,000
on a stage

282
0:12:38.178,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and knowing that there are other worlds out there

283
0:12:43.042,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and desperately wanting to know more about them,

284
0:12:47.174,000 --> 0:12:5,000
wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them

285
0:12:51.132,000 --> 0:12:52,000
are a little bit like you.

286
0:12:54.244,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You can't do that. You can't go there, not yet.

287
0:12:56.827,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And so you have to use the tools that you've developed around you

288
0:13:00.844,000 --> 0:13:01,000
for Venus, Earth and Mars,

289
0:13:02.163,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and you have to apply them to these other situations,

290
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and hope that you're making reasonable inferences from the data,

291
0:13:09.72,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and that you're going to be able to determine the best candidates

292
0:13:12.862,000 --> 0:13:14,000
for habitable planets, and those that are not.

293
0:13:16.139,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In the end, and for now, at least,

294
0:13:18.878,000 --> 0:13:2,000
this is our red spot, right here.

295
0:13:22.376,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This is the only planet that we know of that's habitable,

296
0:13:25.736,000 --> 0:13:28,000
although very soon we may come to know of more.

297
0:13:28.951,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But for now, this is the only habitable planet,

298
0:13:31.711,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and this is our red spot.

299
0:13:33.976,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I'm really glad we're here.

300
0:13:36.507,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Thanks.

301
0:13:37.706,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.716,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Here's an intriguing fact.

2
0:00:15.06,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the developed world,

3
0:00:16.86,000 --> 0:00:21,000
everywhere, women live an average of six to eight years longer than men do.

4
0:00:22.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Six to eight years longer.

5
0:00:24.98,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's, like, a huge gap.

6
0:00:28.42,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article

7
0:00:31.54,000 --> 0:00:33,000
showing that men in rich countries

8
0:00:34.02,000 --> 0:00:36,000
are twice as likely to die as women are

9
0:00:37.02,000 --> 0:00:38,000
at any age.

10
0:00:38.9,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But there is one place in the world

11
0:00:41.82,000 --> 0:00:42,000
where men live as long as women.

12
0:00:44.299,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's a remote, mountainous zone,

13
0:00:46.38,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a blue zone,

14
0:00:47.62,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where super longevity

15
0:00:49.14,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is common to both sexes.

16
0:00:51.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This is the blue zone in Sardinia,

17
0:00:53.7,000 --> 0:00:55,000
an Italian island in the Mediterranean,

18
0:00:55.74,000 --> 0:00:57,000
between Corsica and Tunisia,

19
0:00:58.38,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where there are six times as many centenarians

20
0:01:01.78,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as on the Italian mainland,

21
0:01:03.7,000 --> 0:01:04,000
less than 200 miles away.

22
0:01:05.74,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There are 10 times as many centenarians

23
0:01:07.66,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as there are in North America.

24
0:01:09.86,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's the only place where men live as long as women.

25
0:01:12.98,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But why?

26
0:01:14.3,000 --> 0:01:15,000
My curiosity was piqued.

27
0:01:16.54,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I decided to research the science and the habits of the place,

28
0:01:19.9,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I started with the genetic profile.

29
0:01:22.34,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I discovered soon enough

30
0:01:24.42,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that genes account for just 25 percent of their longevity.

31
0:01:28.46,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

32
0:01:32.02,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So what does it take to live to 100 or beyond?

33
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What are they doing right?

34
0:01:37.22,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What you're looking at is an aerial view of Villagrande.

35
0:01:40.5,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's a village at the epicenter of the blue zone

36
0:01:43.06,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where I went to investigate this,

37
0:01:45.22,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and as you can see, architectural beauty is not its main virtue,

38
0:01:50.66,000 --> 0:01:51,000
density is:

39
0:01:52.3,000 --> 0:01:53,000
tightly spaced houses,

40
0:01:54.3,000 --> 0:01:56,000
interwoven alleys and streets.

41
0:01:56.86,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It means that the villagers' lives constantly intersect.

42
0:02:01.1,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And as I walked through the village,

43
0:02:02.86,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me

44
0:02:06.02,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from behind doorways and curtains,

45
0:02:08.66,000 --> 0:02:09,000
from behind shutters.

46
0:02:10.42,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because like all ancient villages,

47
0:02:12.86,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Villagrande couldn't have survived

48
0:02:15.46,000 --> 0:02:18,000
without this structure, without its walls, without its cathedral,

49
0:02:18.74,000 --> 0:02:19,000
without its village square,

50
0:02:20.66,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because defense and social cohesion defined its design.

51
0:02:25.74,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Urban priorities changed as we moved towards the industrial revolution

52
0:02:29.74,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because infectious disease became the risk of the day.

53
0:02:32.62,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But what about now?

54
0:02:34.38,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, social isolation is the public health risk of our time.

55
0:02:39.78,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, a third of the population says

56
0:02:42.3,000 --> 0:02:44,000
they have two or fewer people to lean on.

57
0:02:45.78,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But let's go to Villagrande now as a contrast

58
0:02:48.58,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to meet some centenarians.

59
0:02:50.66,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Meet Giuseppe Murinu. He's 102, a supercentenarian

60
0:02:54.58,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and a lifelong resident of the village of Villagrande.

61
0:02:57.66,000 --> 0:02:58,000
He was a gregarious man.

62
0:02:59.62,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He loved to recount stories

63
0:03:01.94,000 --> 0:03:02,000
such as how he lived like a bird

64
0:03:03.62,000 --> 0:03:05,000
from what he could find on the forest floor

65
0:03:05.94,000 --> 0:03:08,000
during not one but two world wars,

66
0:03:09.34,000 --> 0:03:12,000
how he and his wife, who also lived past 100,

67
0:03:12.46,000 --> 0:03:15,000
raised six children in a small, homey kitchen

68
0:03:15.82,000 --> 0:03:16,000
where I interviewed him.

69
0:03:17.78,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Here he is with his sons Angelo and Domenico,

70
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:23,000
both in their 70s and looking after their father,

71
0:03:23.5,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and who were quite frankly very suspicious of me and my daughter

72
0:03:27.78,000 --> 0:03:29,000
who came along with me on this research trip,

73
0:03:30.54,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because the flip side of social cohesion

74
0:03:33.38,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.

75
0:03:36.22,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.

76
0:03:40.14,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He was a happy-go-lucky guy,

77
0:03:42.1,000 --> 0:03:45,000
very outgoing with a positive outlook.

78
0:03:45.78,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I wondered: so is that what it takes to live to be 100 or beyond,

79
0:03:50.34,000 --> 0:03:51,000
thinking positively?

80
0:03:53.82,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Actually, no.

81
0:03:55.06,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:00.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,

83
0:04:03.3,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the grumpiest person I have ever met.

84
0:04:06.34,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:07.86,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And he put a lie to the notion

86
0:04:09.58,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that you have to be positive to live a long life.

87
0:04:13.22,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And there is evidence for this.

88
0:04:14.98,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When I asked him why he lived so long,

89
0:04:17.54,000 --> 0:04:2,000
he kind of looked at me under hooded eyelids and he growled,

90
0:04:20.98,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Nobody has to know my secrets."

91
0:04:23.14,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:25.38,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But despite being a sourpuss,

93
0:04:27.62,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the niece who lived with him and looked after him

94
0:04:29.98,000 --> 0:04:31,000
called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure."

95
0:04:33.18,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And she respected him and loved him,

96
0:04:36.38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and she told me, when I questioned this obvious loss of her freedom,

97
0:04:41.22,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"You just don't understand, do you?

98
0:04:43.1,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Looking after this man is a pleasure.

99
0:04:45.82,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's a huge privilege for me.

100
0:04:47.82,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is my heritage."

101
0:04:49.86,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And indeed, wherever I went to interview these centenarians,

102
0:04:53.54,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I found a kitchen party.

103
0:04:55.281,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,

104
0:04:57.02,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Maria above him

105
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and beside him his great-niece Sara,

106
0:05:00.22,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who came when I was there to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.

107
0:05:04.02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I quickly discovered by being there

108
0:05:07.34,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that in the blue zone, as people age,

109
0:05:09.62,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and indeed across their lifespans,

110
0:05:12.1,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they're always surrounded by extended family, by friends,

111
0:05:16.22,000 --> 0:05:19,000
by neighbors, the priest, the barkeeper, the grocer.

112
0:05:19.54,000 --> 0:05:21,000
People are always there or dropping by.

113
0:05:21.86,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They are never left to live solitary lives.

114
0:05:25.58,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is unlike the rest of the developed world,

115
0:05:28.14,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where as George Burns quipped,

116
0:05:29.62,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"Happiness is having a large, loving, caring family in another city."

117
0:05:34.1,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:35.82,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, so far we've only met men,

119
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
long-living men, but I met women too,

120
0:05:41.38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and here you see Zia Teresa.

121
0:05:43.46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
She, at over 100, taught me how to make the local specialty,

122
0:05:47.9,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which is called culurgiones,

123
0:05:49.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which are these large pasta pockets

124
0:05:52.38,000 --> 0:05:54,000
like ravioli about this size,

125
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
this size,

126
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and they're filled with high-fat ricotta and mint

127
0:05:59.06,000 --> 0:06:,000
and drenched in tomato sauce.

128
0:06:00.86,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And she showed me how to make just the right crimp

129
0:06:04.82,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so they wouldn't open,

130
0:06:06.62,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and she makes them with her daughters every Sunday

131
0:06:09.66,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and distributes them by the dozens to neighbors and friends.

132
0:06:13.38,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that's when I discovered a low-fat, gluten-free diet

133
0:06:16.5,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is not what it takes to live to 100 in the blue zone.

134
0:06:19.14,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

135
0:06:22.42,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, these centenarians' stories along with the science that underpins them

136
0:06:27.06,000 --> 0:06:29,000
prompted me to ask myself some questions too,

137
0:06:29.9,000 --> 0:06:32,000
such as, when am I going to die and how can I put that day off?

138
0:06:34.14,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And as you will see, the answer is not what we expect.

139
0:06:38.66,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher at Brigham Young University

140
0:06:42.58,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and she addressed this very question

141
0:06:44.5,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in a series of studies

142
0:06:46.02,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of tens of thousands of middle aged people

143
0:06:48.94,000 --> 0:06:5,000
much like this audience here.

144
0:06:51.1,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And she looked at every aspect of their lifestyle:

145
0:06:54.06,000 --> 0:06:56,000
their diet, their exercise,

146
0:06:56.22,000 --> 0:06:57,000
their marital status,

147
0:06:57.74,000 --> 0:06:58,000
how often they went to the doctor,

148
0:06:59.42,000 --> 0:07:01,000
whether they smoked or drank, etc.

149
0:07:01.94,000 --> 0:07:03,000
She recorded all of this

150
0:07:04.18,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years

151
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to see who would still be breathing.

152
0:07:11.58,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And of the people left standing,

153
0:07:14.7,000 --> 0:07:17,000
what reduced their chances of dying the most?

154
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That was her question.

155
0:07:19.9,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So let's now look at her data in summary,

156
0:07:23.46,000 --> 0:07:27,000
going from the least powerful predictor to the strongest.

157
0:07:28.22,000 --> 0:07:29,000
OK?

158
0:07:29.46,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So clean air, which is great,

159
0:07:31.74,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it doesn't predict how long you will live.

160
0:07:34.82,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Whether you have your hypertension treated

161
0:07:37.58,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is good.

162
0:07:38.94,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Still not a strong predictor.

163
0:07:40.74,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Whether you're lean or overweight, you can stop feeling guilty about this,

164
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because it's only in third place.

165
0:07:46.66,000 --> 0:07:48,000
How much exercise you get is next,

166
0:07:49.18,000 --> 0:07:51,000
still only a moderate predictor.

167
0:07:51.54,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Whether you've had a cardiac event and you're in rehab and exercising,

168
0:07:56.3,000 --> 0:07:57,000
getting higher now.

169
0:07:57.86,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.

170
0:07:59.5,000 --> 0:08:,000
Did anybody here know

171
0:08:00.78,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that having a flu vaccine protects you more than doing exercise?

172
0:08:06.54,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Whether you were drinking and quit,

173
0:08:09.06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
or whether you're a moderate drinker,

174
0:08:11.06,000 --> 0:08:14,000
whether you don't smoke, or if you did, whether you quit,

175
0:08:15.38,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and getting towards the top predictors

176
0:08:19.02,000 --> 0:08:22,000
are two features of your social life.

177
0:08:22.58,000 --> 0:08:24,000
First, your close relationships.

178
0:08:24.98,000 --> 0:08:28,000
These are the people that you can call on for a loan

179
0:08:29.3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if you need money suddenly,

180
0:08:31.94,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who will call the doctor if you're not feeling well

181
0:08:34.54,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or who will take you to the hospital,

182
0:08:36.38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or who will sit with you if you're having an existential crisis,

183
0:08:41.22,000 --> 0:08:42,000
if you're in despair.

184
0:08:43.22,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Those people, that little clutch of people

185
0:08:45.859,000 --> 0:08:48,000
are a strong predictor, if you have them, of how long you'll live.

186
0:08:49.42,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And then something that surprised me,

187
0:08:51.78,000 --> 0:08:53,000
something that's called social integration.

188
0:08:54.42,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This means how much you interact with people

189
0:08:58.5,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as you move through your day.

190
0:09:00.58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
How many people do you talk to?

191
0:09:02.7,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And these mean both your weak and your strong bonds,

192
0:09:06.3,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so not just the people you're really close to,

193
0:09:08.82,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who mean a lot to you,

194
0:09:10.22,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but, like, do you talk to the guy who every day makes you your coffee?

195
0:09:14.78,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Do you talk to the postman?

196
0:09:16.58,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Do you talk to the woman who walks by your house every day with her dog?

197
0:09:20.06,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Do you play bridge or poker, have a book club?

198
0:09:23.06,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Those interactions are one of the strongest predictors

199
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
of how long you'll live.

200
0:09:27.62,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, this leads me to the next question:

201
0:09:30.66,000 --> 0:09:35,000
if we now spend more time online than on any other activity,

202
0:09:36.1,000 --> 0:09:37,000
including sleeping,

203
0:09:37.78,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we're now up to 11 hours a day,

204
0:09:39.98,000 --> 0:09:41,000
one hour more than last year, by the way,

205
0:09:42.5,000 --> 0:09:43,000
does it make a difference?

206
0:09:44.34,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Why distinguish between interacting in person

207
0:09:48.38,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and interacting via social media?

208
0:09:50.62,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Is it the same thing as being there

209
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:56,000
if you're in contact constantly with your kids through text, for example?

210
0:09:58.02,000 --> 0:10:,000
Well, the short answer to the question is no,

211
0:10:00.18,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it's not the same thing.

212
0:10:01.86,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Face-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,

213
0:10:06.7,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present

214
0:10:10.02,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and well into the future.

215
0:10:11.9,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So simply making eye contact with somebody,

216
0:10:15.42,000 --> 0:10:17,000
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five

217
0:10:18.02,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is enough to release oxytocin,

218
0:10:20.1,000 --> 0:10:22,000
which increases your level of trust

219
0:10:22.34,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and it lowers your cortisol levels.

220
0:10:24.74,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So it lowers your stress.

221
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And dopamine is generated, which gives us a little high

222
0:10:30.1,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and it kills pain.

223
0:10:31.34,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's like a naturally produced morphine.

224
0:10:34.98,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, all of this passes under our conscious radar,

225
0:10:37.7,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which is why we conflate online activity with the real thing.

226
0:10:42.02,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But we do have evidence now, fresh evidence,

227
0:10:44.38,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that there is a difference.

228
0:10:45.74,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.

229
0:10:47.82,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland,

230
0:10:51.14,000 --> 0:10:52,000
tried to map the difference

231
0:10:52.98,000 --> 0:10:55,000
between what goes on in our brains when we interact in person

232
0:10:56.66,000 --> 0:10:59,000
versus when we're watching something that's static.

233
0:10:59.9,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And what she did was she compared the brain function

234
0:11:02.353,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of two groups of people,

235
0:11:04.42,000 --> 0:11:07,000
those interacting live with her

236
0:11:07.74,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or with one of her research associates

237
0:11:09.9,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in a dynamic conversation,

238
0:11:12.1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and she compared that to the brain activity of people

239
0:11:14.62,000 --> 0:11:17,000
who were watching her talk about the same subject

240
0:11:18.38,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but in a canned video, like on YouTube.

241
0:11:21.7,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And by the way, if you want to know

242
0:11:23.42,000 --> 0:11:25,000
how she fit two people in an MRI scanner at the same time,

243
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
talk to me later.

244
0:11:28.18,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So what's the difference?

245
0:11:31.1,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is your brain on real social interaction.

246
0:11:34.66,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What you're seeing is the difference in brain activity

247
0:11:37.58,000 --> 0:11:42,000
between interacting in person and taking in static content.

248
0:11:42.74,000 --> 0:11:46,000
In orange, you see the brain areas that are associated with attention,

249
0:11:47.74,000 --> 0:11:48,000
social intelligence --

250
0:11:48.98,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that means anticipating what somebody else is thinking

251
0:11:51.58,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and feeling and planning --

252
0:11:53.34,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and emotional reward.

253
0:11:54.9,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And these areas become much more engaged

254
0:11:57.7,000 --> 0:11:59,000
when we're interacting with a live partner.

255
0:12:01.94,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now, these richer brain signatures

256
0:12:04.66,000 --> 0:12:08,000
might be why recruiters from Fortune 500 companies

257
0:12:08.74,000 --> 0:12:09,000
evaluating candidates

258
0:12:10.7,000 --> 0:12:12,000
thought that the candidates were smarter

259
0:12:13.5,000 --> 0:12:14,000
when they heard their voices

260
0:12:15.98,000 --> 0:12:18,000
compared to when they just read their pitches in a text, for example,

261
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or an email or a letter.

262
0:12:20.7,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now, our voices and body language convey a rich signal.

263
0:12:23.5,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It shows that we're thinking, feeling,

264
0:12:25.54,000 --> 0:12:26,000
sentient human beings

265
0:12:27.22,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who are much more than an algorithm.

266
0:12:29.74,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley

267
0:12:31.82,000 --> 0:12:34,000
at the University of Chicago Business School

268
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing.

269
0:12:39.58,000 --> 0:12:41,000
If somebody hears your voice,

270
0:12:41.66,000 --> 0:12:42,000
they think you're smarter.

271
0:12:43.66,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.

272
0:12:47.14,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now, to return to the beginning,

273
0:12:49.86,000 --> 0:12:5,000
why do women live longer than men?

274
0:12:51.78,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And one major reason is that women are more likely

275
0:12:54.14,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to prioritize and groom their face-to-face relationships

276
0:12:57.54,000 --> 0:12:58,000
over their lifespans.

277
0:12:59.22,000 --> 0:13:,000
Fresh evidence shows

278
0:13:00.9,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that these in-person friendships

279
0:13:02.62,000 --> 0:13:05,000
create a biological force field against disease and decline.

280
0:13:06.62,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And it's not just true of humans

281
0:13:08.82,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but their primate relations, our primate relations as well.

282
0:13:12.22,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work shows that female baboons

283
0:13:15.9,000 --> 0:13:17,000
who have a core of female friends

284
0:13:18.82,000 --> 0:13:21,000
show lower levels of stress via their cortisol levels,

285
0:13:22.42,000 --> 0:13:25,000
they live longer and they have more surviving offspring.

286
0:13:26.46,000 --> 0:13:28,000
At least three stable relationships.

287
0:13:28.86,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That was the magic number.

288
0:13:30.38,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Think about it.

289
0:13:31.62,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I hope you guys have three.

290
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The power of such face-to-face contact

291
0:13:38.3,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is really why there are the lowest rates of dementia

292
0:13:41.14,000 --> 0:13:43,000
among people who are socially engaged.

293
0:13:43.98,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It's why women who have breast cancer

294
0:13:45.82,000 --> 0:13:5,000
are four times more likely to survive their disease than loners are.

295
0:13:51.14,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly to play poker

296
0:13:55.14,000 --> 0:13:56,000
or to have coffee

297
0:13:56.82,000 --> 0:13:58,000
or to play old-timer's hockey --

298
0:13:59.1,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'm Canadian, after all --

299
0:14:00.42,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Laughter)

300
0:14:01.58,000 --> 0:14:03,000
are better protected by that social contact

301
0:14:04.1,000 --> 0:14:06,000
than they are by medication.

302
0:14:06.14,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly --

303
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
this is something very powerful they can do.

304
0:14:11.74,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This face-to-face contact provides stunning benefits,

305
0:14:15.46,000 --> 0:14:19,000
yet now almost a quarter of the population says they have no one to talk to.

306
0:14:20.98,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We can do something about this.

307
0:14:23.34,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Like Sardinian villagers,

308
0:14:25.14,000 --> 0:14:28,000
it's a biological imperative to know we belong,

309
0:14:28.86,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and not just the women among us.

310
0:14:30.9,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Building in-person interaction into our cities, into our workplaces,

311
0:14:35.06,000 --> 0:14:36,000
into our agendas

312
0:14:37.66,000 --> 0:14:38,000
bolsters the immune system,

313
0:14:39.14,000 --> 0:14:43,000
sends feel-good hormones surging through the bloodstream and brain

314
0:14:43.18,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and helps us live longer.

315
0:14:45.66,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I call this building your village,

316
0:14:48.34,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and building it and sustaining it is a matter of life and death.

317
0:14:52.58,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Thank you.

318
0:14:53.82,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

319
0:14:59.95,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Helen Walters: Susan, come back. I have a question for you.

320
0:15:02.74,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I'm wondering if there's a middle path.

321
0:15:04.66,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face,

322
0:15:08.1,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but what about digital technology?

323
0:15:09.78,000 --> 0:15:11,000
We've seen enormous improvements in digital technology

324
0:15:12.38,000 --> 0:15:14,000
like FaceTime, things like that.

325
0:15:14.86,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Does that work too?

326
0:15:16.14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I mean, I see my nephew.

327
0:15:17.42,000 --> 0:15:19,000
He plays Minecraft and he's yelling at his friends.

328
0:15:19.86,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It seems like he's connecting pretty well.

329
0:15:21.9,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Is that useful? Is that helpful?

330
0:15:23.7,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Susan Pinker: Some of the data are just emerging.

331
0:15:26.06,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The data are so fresh that the digital revolution happened

332
0:15:29.06,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and the health data trailed behind.

333
0:15:31.82,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So we're just learning,

334
0:15:33.22,000 --> 0:15:35,000
but I would say there are some improvements

335
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that we could make in the technology.

336
0:15:37.1,000 --> 0:15:4,000
For example, the camera on your laptop is at the top of the screen,

337
0:15:40.58,000 --> 0:15:43,000
so for example, when you're looking into the screen,

338
0:15:43.66,000 --> 0:15:44,000
you're not actually making eye contact.

339
0:15:45.58,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So something as simple as even just looking into the camera

340
0:15:48.78,000 --> 0:15:5,000
can increase those neurotransmitters,

341
0:15:51.06,000 --> 0:15:53,000
or maybe changing the position of the camera.

342
0:15:53.66,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So it's not identical, but I think we are getting closer with the technology.

343
0:15:57.38,000 --> 0:15:58,000
HW: Great. Thank you so much.

344
0:15:59.14,000 --> 0:16:,000
SP: Thank you.

345
0:16:00.38,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Applause)

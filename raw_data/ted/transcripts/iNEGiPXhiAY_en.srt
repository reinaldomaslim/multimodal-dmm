1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But what we're going to talk about today

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is really design. Really good designers are like sponges:

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they really are curious

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and absorb every kind of information that comes their way,

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And so that gives me an opportunity,

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because every design show that I curate

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
kind of looks at a different world. And it's great,

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because it seems like every time I change jobs.

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
"Design and the Elastic Mind."

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The world that I decided to focus on this particular time

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is the world of science and the world of technology.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Technology always comes into play when design is involved,

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but science does a little less.

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and transforming them so that we can use them.

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And this is what this exhibition looks at.

22
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If you think about your life today,

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
you go every day through many different scales,

24
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
many different changes of rhythm and pace.

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.

27
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic,

28
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
others are a little slower,

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Other people are not as elastic.

32
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.

34
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And that's because there's some little bit of fear,

35
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have,

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
these kinds of discomforts that we have,

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and try to make life easier for us.

39
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we really need, we really cherish and we really work on.

41
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this exhibition is about the work of designers

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that help us be more elastic,

43
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and also of designers that really work on this elasticity

44
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as an opportunity. And one last thing is that

45
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.

46
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and into the preview, I would like to point out

48
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
this beautiful detail about scientists and design.

49
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You can say that the relationship between science and design

50
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
goes back centuries. You can of course talk about

51
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --

52
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and there's a gigantic history behind it.

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But according to a really great science historian you might know,

54
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --

55
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics

56
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
have brought to designers is this renewed interest,

57
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
this real passion for design.

58
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,

59
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.

60
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,

61
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
just like designers are seeking scientists.

62
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate

63
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --

64
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that's now a multimedia company, you might know it --

65
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we founded about a year ago a monthly salon

66
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.

67
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.

68
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --

69
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you know, scientists would tell designers,

70
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.

71
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,

72
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden

73
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
they really started talking each others' language,

74
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.

75
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,

76
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation

77
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in London at the Serpentine.

78
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And it's really interesting to see how this happens.

79
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The exhibition will talk about the work

80
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of both designers and scientists,

81
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.

82
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I'm showing to you

83
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
different sections of the show right now,

84
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
just to give you a taste of it.

85
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,

86
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
have really opened the designer's mind.

87
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work,

88
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.

89
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts,

90
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here

91
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is the work of some scientists from UCLA.

92
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --

93
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.

94
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms

95
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students

96
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
from the Royal College of Arts in London

97
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,

98
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain

99
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.

100
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
New sensing elements on the body --

101
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you can grow hairs on your nails,

102
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.

103
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They seem very, very obsessed

104
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with finding out more about the ideal mate.

105
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell --

106
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.

107
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Very interesting. This is a typeface designer

108
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from Israel who has designed -- he calls them "typosperma."

109
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept --

110
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,

111
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi --

112
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in order to make them become -- to almost have a song

113
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)

114
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.

115
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, tissue design.

116
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.

117
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.

118
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.

119
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.

120
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.

121
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.

122
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.

123
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so, the assignment to the students was,

124
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
how should the steak of tomorrow be?

125
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,

126
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
what should it be like?

127
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So this particular student, James King,

128
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
went around the beautiful English countryside,

129
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
picked the best, best cow that he could see,

130
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and then put her in the MRI machine.

131
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --

132
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,

133
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but you know, in the future it could be made better --

134
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.

135
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
Instead, this element here is much more banal.

136
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Something that you know can be done already

137
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring

138
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.

139
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.

140
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is SymbioticA, and they've been working --

141
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --

142
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.

143
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.

144
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse

145
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to be wearing everything leather in the future.

146
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know,

147
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as anything in our life today,

148
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,

149
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and at different levels.

150
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One of the most interesting and most important concepts

151
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is the idea of scale. We change scale very often:

152
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we change resolution of screens, and

153
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.

154
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So you go, even in the exhibition,

155
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale

156
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to the manipulation of really great amounts of data --

157
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.

158
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
In this particular case a section will be devoted

159
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to information design.

160
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" --

161
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.

162
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.

163
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized

164
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with all the go-to, go-back-to,

165
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
also made into a beautiful choreography.

166
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then also graphs by scientists,

167
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.

168
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.

169
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning

170
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the fact that many scientists

171
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,

172
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.

173
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So they pick the worst background

174
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.

175
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's only recently that this kind of marriage

176
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" --

177
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if we can say so -- scientific presentations.

178
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Another aspect of contemporary design

179
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that I think is mind-opening, promising

180
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and will really be the future of design,

181
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is the idea of collective design.

182
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,

183
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.

184
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So, the more the merrier.

185
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The more computers, the stronger the signal,

186
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and children work on the interface so that it's all based

187
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
on doing things together, tasks together.

188
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So the idea of collective design

189
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is something that will become even bigger in the future,

190
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and this is chosen as an example.

191
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance

192
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity

193
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is the idea of existence maximum.

194
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's a term that I coined a few years ago

195
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
while I was thinking of how pressed we are together,

196
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and at the same time how these small objects,

197
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
like the Walkman first and then the iPod,

198
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
create bubbles of space around us that enable us

199
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to have a metaphysical space

200
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
that is much bigger than our physical space.

201
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated

202
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and have your own room in your iPod.

203
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And this is the work of several designers

204
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion

205
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by means of various techniques.

206
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult

207
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to have a private conversation anywhere

208
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,

209
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool

210
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with this perfect temperature, and you can have

211
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this isolation tank phone conversation

212
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.

213
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.

214
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's actually already used by the military a little bit,

215
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else

216
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with your senses while you're removed from it physically.

217
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],

218
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
so if you're too shy to be really at the date,

219
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you can stay at a distance with your flowers

220
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and somebody else reenacts the date for you.

221
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Rapid manufacturing is another big area

222
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in which technology and design are, I think,

223
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.

224
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Rapid manufacturing is a computer file

225
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.

226
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.

227
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning

228
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it was machines carving out of a foam block

229
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
a model that was very, very fragile,

230
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and could not have any real use.

231
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.

232
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Techniques became better -- not only carving

233
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,

234
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,

235
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to the point that now we can have actual chairs

236
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
made by rapid manufacturing.

237
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,

238
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.

239
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,

240
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
customize your chair. You know, companies and designers

241
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
will be designing the matrix or the margins

242
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.

243
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner

244
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,

245
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
not only regarding the participation of the final buyer

246
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in the design process, but also no tracking,

247
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
no warehousing, no wasted materials.

248
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers

249
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
will have to retool their own business plans

250
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.

251
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine --

252
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much --

253
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer

254
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and print your own basketball.

255
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,

256
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
which is very interesting.

257
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.

258
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.

259
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.

260
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Mapping and tagging.

261
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,

262
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,

263
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do

264
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in order to then retrace our path.

265
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Also, we do it in order to share with other people.

266
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Again, this communal sense of experience

267
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that seems to be so important today.

268
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So, various ways to map and tag

269
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are also the work of many designers nowadays.

270
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand

271
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.

272
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And also animal senses in a way.

273
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This particular object that many people love so much

274
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment --

275
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,

276
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --

277
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex

278
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.

279
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And so this student at the RCA

280
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
designed this beautiful blown-glass object

281
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
where the bees move from one chamber to the other

282
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
if they detect that particular smell

283
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.

284
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Another shape is made for cancer.

285
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor

286
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that designers have really shaped for themselves.

287
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Some designers don't design objects, products,

288
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
things that we're going to actually use,

289
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.

290
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They're still very useful.

291
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
They help companies and other designers think better about the future.

292
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And usually they are accompanied by videos.

293
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."

294
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.

295
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We always think that robots will take care of us,

296
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.

297
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes

298
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
for about five minutes before it does something.

299
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,

300
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.

301
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So it's really a way to make us think more

302
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
about what robots mean to us.

303
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":

304
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the idea is that when you lose your loved one

305
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or you go through a bad breakup,

306
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
what you miss the most are those annoying things

307
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that you used to hate when you were with the other person.

308
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So he designed all these series of accessories.

309
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.

310
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck.

311
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There's another one that throws plates and breaks them.

312
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.

313
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Elio Caccavale: he took the idea

314
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of those dolls that explain leukemia.

315
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,

316
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.

317
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls

318
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that explain to children where babies come from today.

319
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,

320
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,

321
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
in-vitro -- there's the whole idea

322
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of how babies can be made today that has changed.

323
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.

324
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
One of the most beautiful things

325
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is that designers really work on life,

326
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
even though they take technology into account.

327
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And many designers have been working recently

328
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
on the idea of death and mourning,

329
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and what we can do about it today with new technologies.

330
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Or how we should behave about it with new technologies.

331
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
These three objects over there are hard drives

332
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality

333
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts

334
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that contain the whole desktop and computer memory

335
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
of somebody who passed away.

336
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So instead of having only the pictures,

337
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
you will be able to put this object next to the computer

338
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and all of a sudden have, you know,

339
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Gertrude's whole life and all of her files

340
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and her address book come alive.

341
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."

342
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.

343
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So to give them something tangible that shows that

344
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
there is something after death, they take the gastric juices

345
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
of people who passed away and concentrate them,

346
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and put them into a battery that can actually be used

347
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.

348
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,

349
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.

350
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition

351
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going --

352
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance

353
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
of where the world is going.

354
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:13.025,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a confession to make.

2
0:00:17.433,000 --> 0:00:23,000
As a scientist and engineer, I've focused on efficiency for many years.

3
0:00:25.213,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But efficiency can be a cult,

4
0:00:29.03,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and today I'd like to tell you about a journey

5
0:00:32.23,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality.

6
0:00:40.091,000 --> 0:00:45,000
A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. in London, I moved to Boston.

7
0:00:45.739,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.

8
0:00:49.381,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I bought a racing bicycle that summer,

9
0:00:52.576,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I bicycled every day to work.

10
0:00:55.306,000 --> 0:00:57,000
To find my way, I used my phone.

11
0:00:57.692,000 --> 0:01:,000
It sent me over Mass. Ave., Massachusetts Avenue,

12
0:01:01.593,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge.

13
0:01:05.842,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But after a month

14
0:01:07.909,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that I was cycling every day on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,

15
0:01:12.495,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I took a different route one day.

16
0:01:15.734,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day, a detour.

17
0:01:20.795,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I just remember a feeling of surprise;

18
0:01:25.184,000 --> 0:01:29,000
surprise at finding a street with no cars,

19
0:01:29.247,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars;

20
0:01:33.078,000 --> 0:01:38,000
surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.

21
0:01:38.395,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But after the feeling of surprise, I felt shame.

22
0:01:43.695,000 --> 0:01:46,000
How could I have been so blind?

23
0:01:46.822,000 --> 0:01:47,000
For an entire month,

24
0:01:48.728,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I was so trapped in my mobile app

25
0:01:51.816,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that a journey to work became one thing only:

26
0:01:55.322,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the shortest path.

27
0:01:57.783,000 --> 0:02:,000
In this single journey, there was no thought

28
0:02:00.876,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of enjoying the road,

29
0:02:03.507,000 --> 0:02:04,000
no pleasure in connecting with nature,

30
0:02:05.459,000 --> 0:02:08,000
no possibility of looking people in the eyes.

31
0:02:09.166,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And why?

32
0:02:10.951,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because I was saving a minute out of my commute.

33
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now let me ask you: Am I alone here?

34
0:02:20.399,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions?

35
0:02:26.227,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Most of you, if not all, have.

36
0:02:28.146,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And don't get me wrong -- mapping apps are the greatest game-changer

37
0:02:33.239,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for encouraging people to explore the city.

38
0:02:35.816,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go.

39
0:02:39.993,000 --> 0:02:41,000
However, the app also assumes

40
0:02:42.904,000 --> 0:02:47,000
there are only a handful of directions to the destination.

41
0:02:48.308,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It has the power to make those handful of directions

42
0:02:52.116,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the definitive direction to that destination.

43
0:02:57.015,000 --> 0:02:59,000
After that experience, I changed.

44
0:02:59.685,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I changed my research from traditional data-mining

45
0:03:03.052,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to understanding how people experience the city.

46
0:03:07.324,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I used computer science tools

47
0:03:09.553,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to replicate social science experiments at scale, at web scale.

48
0:03:14.996,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I became captivated by the beauty and genius

49
0:03:20.118,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of traditional social science experiments

50
0:03:23.02,000 --> 0:03:27,000
done by Jane Jacobs, Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.

51
0:03:27.525,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The result of that research has been the creation of new maps,

52
0:03:32.192,000 --> 0:03:36,000
maps where you don't only find the shortest path, the blue one,

53
0:03:37.021,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but also the most enjoyable path,

54
0:03:40.342,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the red one.

55
0:03:42.06,000 --> 0:03:45,000
How was that possible?

56
0:03:45.662,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Einstein once said,

57
0:03:47.513,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Logic will get you from A to B.

58
0:03:50.999,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Imagination will take you everywhere."

59
0:03:53.771,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So with a bit of imagination,

60
0:03:55.689,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we needed to understand

61
0:03:57.57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which parts of the city people find beautiful.

62
0:04:01.935,000 --> 0:04:03,000
At the University of Cambridge, with colleagues,

63
0:04:04.582,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we thought about this simple experiment.

64
0:04:07.74,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If I were to show you these two urban scenes,

65
0:04:10.898,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I were to ask you which one is more beautiful,

66
0:04:13.684,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which one would you say?

67
0:04:18.096,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Don't be shy.

68
0:04:21.161,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Who says A? Who says B?

69
0:04:24.411,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Brilliant.

70
0:04:26.013,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Based on that idea,

71
0:04:27.987,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we built a crowdsourcing platform,

72
0:04:29.799,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a web game.

73
0:04:30.913,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Players are shown pairs of urban scenes,

74
0:04:33.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and they're asked to choose which one is more beautiful, quiet and happy.

75
0:04:40.154,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Based on thousands of user votes,

76
0:04:42.104,000 --> 0:04:45,000
then we are able to see where consensus emerges.

77
0:04:45.308,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We are able to see which are the urban scenes

78
0:04:48.513,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that make people happy.

79
0:04:51.276,000 --> 0:04:53,000
After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,

80
0:04:54.225,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,

81
0:04:57.104,000 --> 0:05:,000
and together, we aggregated those winning locations in London

82
0:05:00.38,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to build a new map of the city,

83
0:05:03.726,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a cartography weighted for human emotions.

84
0:05:07.993,000 --> 0:05:1,000
On this cartography, you're not only able to see and connect

85
0:05:11.825,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from point A to point B the shortest segments,

86
0:05:16.677,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but you're also able to see the happy segment,

87
0:05:19.812,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the beautiful path, the quiet path.

88
0:05:23.504,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In tests, participants found the happy, the beautiful, the quiet path

89
0:05:28.148,000 --> 0:05:31,000
far more enjoyable than the shortest one,

90
0:05:31.723,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time.

91
0:05:37.528,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Participants also love to attach memories to places.

92
0:05:41.777,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Shared memories -- that's where the old BBC building was;

93
0:05:46.676,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and personal memories -- that's where I gave my first kiss.

94
0:05:51.601,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded.

95
0:05:56.034,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So what if we had a mapping tool

96
0:05:59.261,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that would return the most enjoyable routes

97
0:06:01.792,000 --> 0:06:03,000
based not only on aesthetics

98
0:06:04.412,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but also based on smell, sound, and memories?

99
0:06:07.721,000 --> 0:06:11,000
That's where our research is going right now.

100
0:06:11.826,000 --> 0:06:13,000
More generally, my research,

101
0:06:14.028,000 --> 0:06:18,000
what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path,

102
0:06:18.626,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live.

103
0:06:23.827,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Walk the path through the park, not through the car park,

104
0:06:27.565,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and you have an entirely different path.

105
0:06:29.957,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Walk the path full of people you love

106
0:06:32.905,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and not full of cars,

107
0:06:34.221,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you have an entirely different path.

108
0:06:35.939,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's that simple.

109
0:06:39.012,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I would like to end with this thought:

110
0:06:41.822,000 --> 0:06:43,000
do you remember "The Truman Show?"

111
0:06:43.842,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's a media satire in which a real person

112
0:06:46.86,000 --> 0:06:49,000
doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world.

113
0:06:50.413,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency.

114
0:06:55.567,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Look at some of your daily habits,

115
0:06:59.073,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and as Truman did in the movie, escape the fabricated world.

116
0:07:05.226,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Why?

117
0:07:06.736,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well, if you think that adventure is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.

118
0:07:13.416,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Thank you.

119
0:07:15.327,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Applause)

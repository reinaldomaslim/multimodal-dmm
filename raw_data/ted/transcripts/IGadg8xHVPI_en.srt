1
0:00:15.513,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Basking sharks are awesome creatures.

2
0:00:17.714,000 --> 0:00:18,000
They are just magnificent.

3
0:00:19.061,000 --> 0:00:22,000
They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.

4
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They might weigh up to two tons.

5
0:00:24.672,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Some say up to five tons.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
They're the second-largest fish in the world.

7
0:00:28.537,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They're also harmless plankton-feeding animals.

8
0:00:31.173,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour

9
0:00:36.633,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive.

10
0:00:41.394,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They're fantastic creatures.

11
0:00:42.783,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We're very lucky in Ireland,

12
0:00:44.164,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them.

13
0:00:47.768,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They were very important to coastal communities,

14
0:00:50.09,000 --> 0:00:51,000
going back hundreds of years,

15
0:00:51.55,000 --> 0:00:53,000
especially around the Claddaghduff, Connemara region

16
0:00:54.326,000 --> 0:00:57,000
where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats,

17
0:00:57.948,000 --> 0:00:59,000
sometimes way offshore to a place called the Sunfish Bank,

18
0:01:00.699,000 --> 0:01:01,000
about 30 miles west of Achill Island,

19
0:01:02.5,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to kill the basking sharks.

20
0:01:03.817,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is a woodcut from about the 1800s.

21
0:01:06.013,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They were very important, for the oil out of their liver.

22
0:01:08.788,000 --> 0:01:1,000
A third of the basking shark's size is their liver,

23
0:01:11.274,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it's full of oil, gallons of oil.

24
0:01:13.081,000 --> 0:01:15,000
That oil was used especially for lighting,

25
0:01:15.194,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but also for dressing wounds and other things.

26
0:01:17.391,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In fact, the streetlights in 1742,

27
0:01:19.301,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,

28
0:01:20.849,000 --> 0:01:21,000
were lit with sunfish oil.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"Sunfish" is one of the words for basking sharks.

30
0:01:24.674,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So they were incredibly important animals.

31
0:01:26.714,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They've been around a long time, very important to coastal communities.

32
0:01:30.107,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Probably the best-documented basking shark fishery in the world

33
0:01:33.425,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is that from Achill Island.

34
0:01:34.961,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.

35
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Sharks used to come into the bay,

36
0:01:39.537,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland,

37
0:01:42.562,000 --> 0:01:43,000
string it out, an old Manila net,

38
0:01:44.218,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and as the shark came round, it would hit the net,

39
0:01:46.591,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the net would collapse on it.

40
0:01:48.011,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It would often drown and suffocate.

41
0:01:49.73,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Or at times, they would row out in their small curraghs

42
0:01:52.609,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.

43
0:01:55.167,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour,

44
0:01:57.935,000 --> 0:01:58,000
boil them up, use the oil.

45
0:01:59.683,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer

46
0:02:03.631,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and also would fin the sharks.

47
0:02:06.551,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide --

48
0:02:09.416,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the finning of sharks.

49
0:02:11.479,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We're often frightened of sharks, thanks to "Jaws."

50
0:02:13.992,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.

51
0:02:17.07,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There was someone recently, wasn't there? Just a couple weeks ago.

52
0:02:20.269,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I don't know what the balance is,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them.

55
0:02:28.278,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was a well-documented fishery.

56
0:02:29.931,000 --> 0:02:31,000
As you can see here, it peaked in the '50s,

57
0:02:32.158,000 --> 0:02:34,000
where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year.

58
0:02:34.279,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And it declined very fast -- a classic boom-and-bust fishery,

59
0:02:37.237,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which suggests that a stock has been depleted

60
0:02:39.933,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or there's low reproductive rates.

61
0:02:41.895,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,

62
0:02:44.389,000 --> 0:02:46,000
literally just by stringing a Manila rope

63
0:02:47.343,000 --> 0:02:49,000
off the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.

64
0:02:50.437,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s,

65
0:02:52.874,000 --> 0:02:55,000
especially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford.

66
0:02:55.911,000 --> 0:02:57,000
About two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85,

67
0:02:58.764,000 --> 0:02:59,000
mainly by Norwegian vessels.

68
0:03:00.482,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You can't really see,

69
0:03:01.66,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels.

70
0:03:04.223,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel,

71
0:03:07.802,000 --> 0:03:09,000
rather than a whaling vessel.

72
0:03:09.898,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities

73
0:03:12.767,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is recognized through the language.

74
0:03:14.469,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I don't pretend to [know many Irish words],

75
0:03:16.778,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but in Kerry they were often known as "ainmhide Na seolta,"

76
0:03:20.36,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"the monster with the sails."

77
0:03:22.361,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Another title would be "liop an dá lapa,"

78
0:03:25.389,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"the unwieldy beast with two fins."

79
0:03:28.08,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.

80
0:03:31.119,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Or my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine," "the great fish of the sun."

81
0:03:34.646,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That's a lovely, evocative name.

82
0:03:36.206,000 --> 0:03:39,000
On Tory Island -- a strange place anyway -- they were known as "muldoons."

83
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:40.805,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No one seems to know why.

85
0:03:42.024,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Hope there's no one from Tory here. Lovely place.

86
0:03:44.383,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish.

87
0:03:48.43,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface

88
0:03:51.163,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when the sun is out.

89
0:03:52.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted

90
0:03:54.932,000 --> 0:03:55,000
all throughout the world.

91
0:03:56.469,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Some say it's not population decline,

92
0:03:58.486,000 --> 0:04:,000
it might be a change in the distribution of plankton.

93
0:04:00.999,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's been suggested

94
0:04:02.18,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change,

95
0:04:05.428,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as they're basically continuous plankton recorders,

96
0:04:07.863,000 --> 0:04:08,000
swimming around with their mouth open.

97
0:04:09.707,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.

98
0:04:12.016,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.

99
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's now a ban on catching and even landing them,

100
0:04:17.48,000 --> 0:04:19,000
even landing ones caught accidentally.

101
0:04:19.569,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They're not protected in Ireland;

102
0:04:21.181,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever,

103
0:04:24.19,000 --> 0:04:25,000
despite our importance for the species

104
0:04:26.144,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside.

105
0:04:29.722,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We know very little about them.

106
0:04:31.96,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And most of what we do know

107
0:04:33.385,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is based on their habit of coming to the surface --

108
0:04:36.195,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.

109
0:04:39.621,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man,

110
0:04:42.713,000 --> 0:04:44,000
just how unusual it is to live somewhere

111
0:04:45.451,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably

112
0:04:49.022,000 --> 0:04:51,000
come to the surface to "bask."

113
0:04:51.986,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist

114
0:04:54.105,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to see and experience basking sharks.

115
0:04:55.93,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They are awesome creatures.

116
0:04:57.303,000 --> 0:05:,000
It gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them.

117
0:05:00.783,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What we've been doing for a couple years -- last year was a big year --

118
0:05:04.205,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is we started tagging sharks,

119
0:05:06.083,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement

120
0:05:09.153,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and things like that.

121
0:05:10.335,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry

122
0:05:13.66,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as the two areas where I was mainly active.

123
0:05:16.395,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech,

124
0:05:20.576,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with a big, long pole.

125
0:05:21.776,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.

126
0:05:24.426,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.

127
0:05:27.859,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And we were very effective.

128
0:05:29.431,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.

129
0:05:32.293,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.

130
0:05:35.968,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Half the challenge to get access

131
0:05:37.549,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is to be in the right place at the right time.

132
0:05:39.787,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like.

133
0:05:43.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.

134
0:05:46.155,000 --> 0:05:48,000
One, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark.

135
0:05:48.716,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well.

136
0:05:52.403,000 --> 0:05:53,000
These are archival tags.

137
0:05:53.736,000 --> 0:05:54,000
What they do is store the data.

138
0:05:55.699,000 --> 0:05:57,000
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water

139
0:05:58.609,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and can send a signal to the satellite.

140
0:06:00.53,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And sharks and fish are underwater most of the time,

141
0:06:03.009,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so this tag actually works out the locations of shark,

142
0:06:05.962,000 --> 0:06:08,000
depending on the timing and the setting of the sun,

143
0:06:09.348,000 --> 0:06:1,000
plus water temperature and depth.

144
0:06:11.323,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.

145
0:06:13.515,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What happens is,

146
0:06:14.712,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period --

147
0:06:17.826,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in this case, eight months --

148
0:06:19.248,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and literally to the day, the tag popped off,

149
0:06:21.38,000 --> 0:06:22,000
drifted up, said hello to the satellite

150
0:06:23.283,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use.

151
0:06:26.176,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements

152
0:06:29.444,000 --> 0:06:3,000
when they're underwater.

153
0:06:31.537,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.

154
0:06:33.66,000 --> 0:06:36,000
In that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry.

155
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Basically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.

156
0:06:40.349,000 --> 0:06:42,000
On Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge.

157
0:06:42.382,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet

158
0:06:44.35,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with sea-surface temperature and water depth,

159
0:06:46.499,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but again, the second shark spent most of its time

160
0:06:48.876,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in and around the Irish Sea.

161
0:06:50.249,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark

162
0:06:53.451,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.

163
0:06:56.659,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened.

164
0:07:00.006,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.

165
0:07:03.954,000 --> 0:07:04,000
His tags didn't really work.

166
0:07:05.418,000 --> 0:07:06,000
All he knows is where he tagged them,

167
0:07:07.275,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and where they popped off.

168
0:07:08.767,000 --> 0:07:1,000
His tags popped off in the Caribbean,

169
0:07:11.109,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and even in Brazil.

170
0:07:12.66,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We thought basking sharks were temperate animals

171
0:07:14.999,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and lived in our latitudes,

172
0:07:16.515,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well.

173
0:07:19.731,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So very simple things like that,

174
0:07:21.517,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we're trying to learn about basking sharks.

175
0:07:24.348,000 --> 0:07:28,000
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing

176
0:07:28.945,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.

177
0:07:31.934,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics.

178
0:07:35.419,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.

179
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Whereas I'm a field person,

180
0:07:39.136,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I get panic attacks

181
0:07:40.684,000 --> 0:07:43,000
if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.

182
0:07:43.856,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Take me away.

183
0:07:45.111,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So we can work with geneticists who understand that.

184
0:07:47.715,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks,

185
0:07:50.319,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they found that the diversity was incredibly low.

186
0:07:53.352,000 --> 0:07:54,000
If you look at the first line, really,

187
0:07:55.235,000 --> 0:07:58,000
you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar.

188
0:07:58.715,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I think this means they're all sharks

189
0:08:00.517,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they've come from a common ancestry.

190
0:08:02.471,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But if you look at nucleotide diversity,

191
0:08:04.565,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents,

192
0:08:07.809,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study,

193
0:08:10.666,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species.

194
0:08:14.66,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You can see this work was only done in 2006.

195
0:08:16.756,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks.

196
0:08:20.417,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We had no idea: Did they distinguish into different populations?

197
0:08:23.554,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Were there subpopulations?

198
0:08:24.853,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And that's very important if you want to know

199
0:08:27.028,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what the population size is, and the status of the animals.

200
0:08:29.829,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really.

201
0:08:33.464,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So he did another study using microsatellites,

202
0:08:40.073,000 --> 0:08:42,000
which is much more expensive, much more time-consuming,

203
0:08:42.708,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and to his surprise, came up with almost identical results.

204
0:08:45.993,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason,

205
0:08:48.929,000 --> 0:08:49,000
have incredibly low diversity.

206
0:08:50.723,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck,

207
0:08:53.241,000 --> 0:08:55,000
thought to have been 12,000 years ago,

208
0:08:55.336,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and this has caused a very low diversity.

209
0:08:57.884,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And yet, if you look at the whale shark,

210
0:08:59.868,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which is the other plankton-eating large shark,

211
0:09:02.607,000 --> 0:09:03,000
its diversity is much greater.

212
0:09:04.102,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So it doesn't really make sense at all.

213
0:09:06.561,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They found that there was no genetic differentiation

214
0:09:09.019,000 --> 0:09:11,000
between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks:

215
0:09:11.504,000 --> 0:09:13,000
even though they're found throughout the world,

216
0:09:13.766,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you couldn't tell the difference, genetically,

217
0:09:15.948,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.

218
0:09:19.405,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They all basically seem the same.

219
0:09:21.008,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Which, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that.

220
0:09:23.937,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I don't understand or pretend to understand this;

221
0:09:26.308,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I suspect most geneticists don't either,

222
0:09:28.242,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but they produce the numbers.

223
0:09:29.66,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So you can actually estimate the population size

224
0:09:32.011,000 --> 0:09:34,000
based on the diversity of the genetics.

225
0:09:34.205,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:

226
0:09:37.781,000 --> 0:09:38,000
8,200 animals.

227
0:09:39.638,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.

228
0:09:42.566,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You're thinking, "That's ridiculous. No way."

229
0:09:44.812,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So Les did a finer study,

230
0:09:46.66,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and he found out it came out about 9,000.

231
0:09:49.462,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Using different microsatellites gave the different results,

232
0:09:52.367,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but the mean of all these studies is about 5,000,

233
0:09:57.032,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which I personally don't believe.

234
0:09:58.66,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But then, I am a skeptic.

235
0:10:00.314,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But even if you toss a few numbers around,

236
0:10:02.767,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals.

237
0:10:06.208,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?

238
0:10:10.747,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So what it tells us, actually,

239
0:10:12.467,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species

240
0:10:15.743,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because its population is so small.

241
0:10:17.66,000 --> 0:10:18,000
In fact, of those 20,000,

242
0:10:19.215,000 --> 0:10:21,000
8,000 were thought to be females.

243
0:10:21.407,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?

244
0:10:24.118,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I don't know. I don't believe it.

245
0:10:26.385,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.

246
0:10:30.052,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They didn't get enough samples

247
0:10:31.659,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to really explore the genetics in enough detail.

248
0:10:35.974,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?

249
0:10:40.93,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Well, one obvious source is dead sharks --

250
0:10:43.742,000 --> 0:10:44,000
dead sharks, washed up.

251
0:10:45.018,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year,

252
0:10:48.298,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if we're kind of lucky.

253
0:10:49.844,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Another source would be fisheries' bycatch.

254
0:10:52.218,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.

255
0:10:55.231,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks.

256
0:10:58.041,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And some are caught in nets, in trawls.

257
0:10:59.982,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas --

258
0:11:03.624,000 --> 0:11:06,000
illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law --

259
0:11:06.675,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.

260
0:11:09.537,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They even put a recipe up on the wall,

261
0:11:11.385,000 --> 0:11:12,000
until they were told it was illegal.

262
0:11:13.187,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They actually did get a fine for that.

263
0:11:15.09,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So if you look at all those studies I showed you,

264
0:11:17.44,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the total number of samples worldwide

265
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is 86, at present.

266
0:11:22.118,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So it's very important work,

267
0:11:24.234,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they can ask some really good questions,

268
0:11:26.353,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure,

269
0:11:30.66,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but they're constrained by lack of samples.

270
0:11:34.004,000 --> 0:11:35,000
When we were out tagging our sharks --

271
0:11:35.877,000 --> 0:11:38,000
this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB, get in there fast --

272
0:11:39.211,000 --> 0:11:41,000
occasionally, the sharks do react.

273
0:11:41.401,000 --> 0:11:43,000
On one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal,

274
0:11:44.176,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail,

275
0:11:46.698,000 --> 0:11:49,000
more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it,

276
0:11:49.866,000 --> 0:11:5,000
rather than the tag going in.

277
0:11:52.217,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.

278
0:11:55.136,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,

279
0:11:59.15,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.

280
0:12:01.616,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats,

281
0:12:04.369,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and I remember fishermen saying

282
0:12:05.872,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net,

283
0:12:08.719,000 --> 0:12:09,000
because it leaves a black slime behind.

284
0:12:10.623,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So that must have come from the shark.

285
0:12:12.478,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics

286
0:12:15.896,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because we knew they were very valuable.

287
0:12:17.906,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We would use conventional methods;

288
0:12:19.587,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I have a crossbow -- you see it in my hand there,

289
0:12:21.928,000 --> 0:12:24,000
which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well.

290
0:12:25.438,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So I tried that, I tried many techniques.

291
0:12:27.437,000 --> 0:12:28,000
All it was doing was breaking my arrows,

292
0:12:29.39,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because the shark's skin is just so strong.

293
0:12:31.439,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.

294
0:12:34.239,000 --> 0:12:35,000
That wasn't going to work.

295
0:12:35.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,

296
0:12:38.421,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I thought, "If you take what you're given in this world ..."

297
0:12:41.422,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So I scraped it off.

298
0:12:42.61,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.

299
0:12:47.029,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen,

300
0:12:50.108,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and said, "You might try that."

301
0:12:51.648,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And they sat on it for months.

302
0:12:53.282,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.

303
0:12:56.118,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But I kept emailing Les, saying,

304
0:12:57.681,000 --> 0:12:59,000
"Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"

305
0:12:59.8,000 --> 0:13:,000
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later."

306
0:13:01.667,000 --> 0:13:03,000
He thought he'd better do it because I never met him before;

307
0:13:04.514,000 --> 0:13:06,000
he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.

308
0:13:07.293,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.

309
0:13:10.168,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They amplified it and they tested it,

310
0:13:12.027,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA,

311
0:13:14.849,000 --> 0:13:15,000
which was got from the slime.

312
0:13:17.828,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So he was very excited.

313
0:13:19.017,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It became known as "Simon's shark slime."

314
0:13:22.326,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this."

315
0:13:25.241,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime.

316
0:13:29.027,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...

317
0:13:35.247,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it --

318
0:13:38.708,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in my local hardware store in Kilrush

319
0:13:40.922,000 --> 0:13:41,000
for a mop handle,

320
0:13:42.716,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and even less money on some oven cleaners.

321
0:13:45.66,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle

322
0:13:49.155,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and ...

323
0:13:50.66,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

324
0:13:52.242,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.

325
0:13:55.797,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July,

326
0:14:00.214,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place

327
0:14:03.227,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to find sharks into August.

328
0:14:04.802,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets

329
0:14:07.256,000 --> 0:14:09,000
as soon as we heard there were sharks there,

330
0:14:09.35,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and managed to find some sharks.

331
0:14:10.901,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark

332
0:14:14.389,000 --> 0:14:15,000
as it swam under the boat --

333
0:14:15.981,000 --> 0:14:17,000
you see a shark running under the boat here --

334
0:14:18.515,000 --> 0:14:19,000
we managed to collect slime.

335
0:14:19.881,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And here it is.

336
0:14:21.153,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Look at that lovely black shark slime.

337
0:14:24.906,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And in about half an hour, we got five samples.

338
0:14:29.523,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Five individual sharks were sampled

339
0:14:31.3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.

340
0:14:34.156,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

341
0:14:35.995,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Applause)

342
0:14:41.35,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now,

343
0:14:44.628,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and they're a bit more dramatic.

344
0:14:46.191,000 --> 0:14:48,000
You probably saw the humpback whale footage

345
0:14:48.251,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we got a month or two ago off County Wexford.

346
0:14:50.385,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And you always think you might have some legacy

347
0:14:52.659,000 --> 0:14:53,000
you can leave the world behind,

348
0:14:54.177,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins.

349
0:14:57.136,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But hey -- sometimes these things are sent to you

350
0:14:59.545,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and you just have to take them when they come.

351
0:15:01.761,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So this is possibly going to be my legacy --

352
0:15:03.882,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Simon's Shark Slime.

353
0:15:05.548,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We got more money this year

354
0:15:07.206,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to carry on collecting more and more samples.

355
0:15:09.851,000 --> 0:15:11,000
One thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera --

356
0:15:12.815,000 --> 0:15:14,000
this is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera --

357
0:15:15.252,000 --> 0:15:16,000
where you can look underneath the shark.

358
0:15:17.215,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers,

359
0:15:20.008,000 --> 0:15:22,000
which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark.

360
0:15:22.652,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.

361
0:15:25.273,000 --> 0:15:28,000
If we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it,

362
0:15:29.044,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female.

363
0:15:32.175,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Because in the moment, they have no way, genetically,

364
0:15:34.702,000 --> 0:15:36,000
of telling the difference between a male and a female,

365
0:15:37.264,000 --> 0:15:38,000
which I find staggering,

366
0:15:38.447,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because they don't know what primers to look for.

367
0:15:41.056,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Being able to tell the gender of a shark

368
0:15:43.394,000 --> 0:15:47,000
is very important for things like policing the trade

369
0:15:47.66,000 --> 0:15:51,000
in basking shark and other species through the sightings,

370
0:15:52.08,000 --> 0:15:54,000
because it is illegal to trade in these sharks.

371
0:15:54.319,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And they are caught and are on the market.

372
0:15:56.381,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So as a field biologist,

373
0:15:57.776,000 --> 0:15:59,000
you just want to get encounters with these animals,

374
0:16:00.246,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and learn as much as you can.

375
0:16:01.66,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained.

376
0:16:05.094,000 --> 0:16:07,000
You just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.

377
0:16:08.023,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But isn't it fantastic

378
0:16:09.814,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that you can then offer these samples and opportunities

379
0:16:13.337,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to other disciplines, such as the geneticists,

380
0:16:16.181,000 --> 0:16:18,000
who can gain so much more from that.

381
0:16:18.66,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways.

382
0:16:22.39,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Grab them while you can.

383
0:16:23.66,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.

384
0:16:25.626,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Hopefully, I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic

385
0:16:28.737,000 --> 0:16:29,000
before I die.

386
0:16:30.01,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But for the time being, thank you for that.

387
0:16:32.439,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And keep an eye out for sharks.

388
0:16:33.949,000 --> 0:16:36,000
If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now set up.

389
0:16:37.719,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So thank you and thank you for listening.

390
0:16:39.713,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Applause)

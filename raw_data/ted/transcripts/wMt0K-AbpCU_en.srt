2
0:00:12.644,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So sometimes I get angry,

3
0:00:15.857,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and it took me many years to be able to say just those words.

4
0:00:20.125,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In my work,

5
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:24,000
sometimes my body thrums, I'm so enraged.

6
0:00:26.125,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But no matter how justified my anger has been,

7
0:00:30.023,000 --> 0:00:31,000
throughout my life,

8
0:00:31.834,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've always been led to understand that my anger is an exaggeration,

9
0:00:36.795,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a misrepresentation,

10
0:00:38.723,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that it will make me rude and unlikable.

11
0:00:42.406,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Mainly as a girl, I learned, as a girl, that anger is an emotion

12
0:00:47.917,000 --> 0:00:49,000
better left entirely unvoiced.

13
0:00:51.957,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Think about my mother for a minute.

14
0:00:53.861,000 --> 0:00:55,000
When I was 15, I came home from school one day,

15
0:00:56.688,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and she was standing on a long veranda outside of our kitchen,

16
0:01:00.13,000 --> 0:01:01,000
holding a giant stack of plates.

17
0:01:02.813,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Imagine how dumbfounded I was when she started to throw them like Frisbees...

18
0:01:08.292,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:09.622,000 --> 0:01:11,000
into the hot, humid air.

20
0:01:12.511,000 --> 0:01:15,000
When every single plate had shattered into thousands of pieces

21
0:01:16.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
on the hill below,

22
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:21,000
she walked back in and she said to me, cheerfully, "How was your day?"

23
0:01:21.747,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:25.674,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now you can see how a child would look at an incident like this

25
0:01:31.214,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and think that anger is silent, isolating, destructive, even frightening.

26
0:01:37.333,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Especially though when the person who's angry is a girl or a woman.

27
0:01:43.167,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The question is why.

28
0:01:45.375,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Anger is a human emotion, neither good nor bad.

29
0:01:49.375,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It is actually a signal emotion.

30
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It warns us of indignity, threat, insult and harm.

31
0:01:55.625,000 --> 0:02:,000
And yet, in culture after culture, anger is reserved as the moral property

32
0:02:01.5,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of boys and men.

33
0:02:03.792,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, to be sure, there are differences.

34
0:02:05.674,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So in the United States, for example,

35
0:02:07.958,000 --> 0:02:11,000
an angry black man is viewed as a criminal,

36
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but an angry white man has civic virtue.

37
0:02:15.5,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Regardless of where we are, however, the emotion is gendered.

38
0:02:19.917,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so we teach children to disdain anger in girls and women,

39
0:02:24.728,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and we grow up to be adults that penalize it.

40
0:02:29.917,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So what if we didn't do that?

41
0:02:32.708,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What if we didn't sever anger from femininity?

42
0:02:36.188,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Because severing anger from femininity means we sever girls and women

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from the emotion that best protects us from injustice.

44
0:02:43.583,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What if instead we thought about developing emotional competence

45
0:02:47.695,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for boys and girls?

46
0:02:49.833,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The fact is we still remarkably socialize children

47
0:02:53.606,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in very binary and oppositional ways.

48
0:02:56.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
Boys are held to absurd, rigid norms of masculinity --

49
0:03:01.448,000 --> 0:03:05,000
told to renounce the feminine emotionality of sadness or fear

50
0:03:05.542,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and to embrace aggression and anger as markers of real manhood.

51
0:03:10.083,000 --> 0:03:14,000
On the other hand, girls learn to be deferential,

52
0:03:14.542,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and anger is incompatible with deference.

53
0:03:18.081,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In the same way that we learned to cross our legs and tame our hair,

54
0:03:24.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we learned to bite our tongues and swallow our pride.

55
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What happens too often is that for all of us,

56
0:03:32.077,000 --> 0:03:35,000
indignity becomes imminent in our notions of femininity.

57
0:03:36.674,000 --> 0:03:4,000
There's a long personal and political tale to that bifurcation.

58
0:03:42.205,000 --> 0:03:47,000
In anger, we go from being spoiled princesses and hormonal teens,

59
0:03:47.823,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to high maintenance women and shrill, ugly nags.

60
0:03:52.6,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We have flavors, though; pick your flavor.

61
0:03:55.208,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Are you a spicy hot Latina when you're mad?

62
0:03:58.549,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Or a sad Asian girl? An angry black woman? Or a crazy white one?

63
0:04:05.675,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You can pick.

64
0:04:07.125,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But in fact, the effect is that when we say what's important to us,

65
0:04:11.824,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is what anger is conveying,

66
0:04:14.125,000 --> 0:04:17,000
people are more likely to get angry at us for being angry.

67
0:04:18.708,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Whether we're at home or in school or at work or in a political arena,

68
0:04:24.417,000 --> 0:04:27,000
anger confirms masculinity, and it confounds femininity.

69
0:04:29.055,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So men are rewarded for displaying it,

70
0:04:31.826,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and women are penalized for doing the same.

71
0:04:35.917,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This puts us at an enormous disadvantage,

72
0:04:38.547,000 --> 0:04:41,000
particularly when we have to defend ourselves and our own interests.

73
0:04:43.583,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If we're faced with a threatening street harasser, predatory employer,

74
0:04:47.734,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a sexist, racist classmate,

75
0:04:50.311,000 --> 0:04:53,000
our brains are screaming, "Are you kidding me?"

76
0:04:54.922,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And our mouths say, "I'm sorry, what?"

77
0:04:58.208,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

78
0:05:00.917,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Right?

79
0:05:03.097,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And it's conflicting because the anger gets all tangled up

80
0:05:06.255,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with the anxiety and the fear and the risk and retaliation.

81
0:05:09.708,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If you ask women what they fear the most in response to their anger,

82
0:05:13.384,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they don't say violence.

83
0:05:15.003,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They say mockery.

84
0:05:17.233,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Think about what that means.

85
0:05:20.487,000 --> 0:05:24,000
If you have multiple marginalized identities, it's not just mockery.

86
0:05:25.05,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If you defend yourself, if you put a stake in the ground,

87
0:05:29.423,000 --> 0:05:31,000
there can be dire consequences.

88
0:05:32.113,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now we reproduce these patterns not in big, bold and blunt ways,

89
0:05:37.042,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but in the everyday banality of life.

90
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
When my daughter was in preschool, every single morning

91
0:05:44.125,000 --> 0:05:47,000
she built an elaborate castle -- ribbons and blocks --

92
0:05:47.583,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and every single morning the same boy knocked it down gleefully.

93
0:05:51.708,000 --> 0:05:55,000
His parents were there, but they never intervened before the fact.

94
0:05:56.432,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They were happy to provide platitudes afterwards:

95
0:06:00.208,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Boys will be boys."

96
0:06:02.292,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"It's so tempting, he just couldn't help himself."

97
0:06:06.292,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I did what many girls and women learn to do.

98
0:06:10.128,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I preemptively kept the peace,

99
0:06:12.23,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I taught my daughter to do the same thing.

100
0:06:15.46,000 --> 0:06:16,000
She used her words.

101
0:06:18.333,000 --> 0:06:2,000
She tried to gently body block him.

102
0:06:20.958,000 --> 0:06:24,000
She moved where she was building in the classroom, to no effect.

103
0:06:25.777,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So I and the other adults mutually constructed a particular male entitlement.

104
0:06:32.417,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He could run rampant and control the environment,

105
0:06:35.747,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and she kept her feelings to herself and worked around his needs.

106
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We failed both of them by not giving her anger the uptake

107
0:06:45.417,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and resolution that it deserved.

108
0:06:48.103,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now that's a microcosm of a much bigger problem.

109
0:06:51.881,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Because culturally, worldwide,

110
0:06:55.929,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we preference the performance of masculinity --

111
0:06:59.873,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the power and privilege that come with that performance --

112
0:07:03.063,000 --> 0:07:07,000
over the rights and needs and words of children and women.

113
0:07:08.917,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So it will come as absolutely no surprise, probably, to the people in this room

114
0:07:13.392,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that women report being angrier in more sustained ways and with more intensity

115
0:07:19.388,000 --> 0:07:2,000
than men do.

116
0:07:21.71,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Some of that comes from the fact that we're socialized to ruminate,

117
0:07:24.941,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to keep it to ourselves and mull it over.

118
0:07:27.75,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But we also have to find socially palatable ways

119
0:07:31.425,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to express the intensity of emotion that we have

120
0:07:35.248,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and the awareness that it brings of our precarity.

121
0:07:39.63,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So we do several things.

122
0:07:42.186,000 --> 0:07:47,000
If men knew how often women were filled with white hot rage when we cried,

123
0:07:47.625,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they would be staggered.

124
0:07:49.402,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

125
0:07:51.083,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We use minimizing language.

126
0:07:53.042,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"We're frustrated. No, really, it's OK."

127
0:07:55.458,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:57.917,000 --> 0:08:,000
We self-objectify and lose the ability

129
0:08:01.027,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to even recognize the physiological changes that indicate anger.

130
0:08:07.667,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Mainly, though, we get sick.

131
0:08:11.125,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Anger has now been implicated in a whole array of illnesses

132
0:08:15.71,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that are casually dismissed as "women's illnesses."

133
0:08:19.21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Higher rates of chronic pain, autoimmune disorders, disordered eating,

134
0:08:24.797,000 --> 0:08:27,000
mental distress, anxiety, self harm, depression.

135
0:08:29.257,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Anger affects our immune systems, our cardiovascular systems.

136
0:08:33.374,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Some studies even indicate that it affects mortality rates,

137
0:08:37.717,000 --> 0:08:39,000
particularly in black women with cancer.

138
0:08:42.271,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired.

139
0:08:49.198,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Our anger brings great discomfort,

140
0:08:52.246,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and the conflict comes because it's our role to bring comfort.

141
0:08:57.372,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There is anger that's acceptable.

142
0:08:58.968,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We can be angry when we stay in our lanes and buttress the status quo.

143
0:09:05.255,000 --> 0:09:07,000
As mothers or teachers,

144
0:09:08.167,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we can be mad, but we can't be angry about the tremendous costs of nurturing.

145
0:09:13.875,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We can be angry at our mothers.

146
0:09:15.667,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Let's say, as teenagers -- patriarchal rules and regulations --

147
0:09:19.396,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we don't blame systems, we blame them.

148
0:09:21.626,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We can be angry at other women, because who doesn't love a good catfight?

149
0:09:26.411,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And we can be angry at men with lower status in an expressive hierarchy

150
0:09:32.284,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that supports racism or xenophobia.

151
0:09:35.864,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But we have an enormous power in this.

152
0:09:38.543,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Because feelings are the purview of our authority,

153
0:09:43.625,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and people are uncomfortable with our anger.

154
0:09:46.792,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We should be making people comfortable with the discomfort they feel

155
0:09:51.426,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when women say no, unapologetically.

156
0:09:55.917,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We can take emotions and think in terms of competence and not gender.

157
0:10:01.465,000 --> 0:10:04,000
People who are able to process their anger and make meaning from it

158
0:10:05.798,000 --> 0:10:07,000
are more creative, more optimistic,

159
0:10:08.958,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they have more intimacy,

160
0:10:10.917,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they're better problem solvers,

161
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
they have greater political efficacy.

162
0:10:17.251,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now I am a woman writing about women and feelings,

163
0:10:20.464,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so very few men with power

164
0:10:23.146,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are going to take what I'm saying seriously, as a matter of politics.

165
0:10:27.789,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We think of politics and anger in terms of the contempt and disdain and fury

166
0:10:33.761,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that are feeding a rise of macho-fascism in the world.

167
0:10:37.375,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But if it's that poison, it's also the antidote.

168
0:10:41.542,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We have an anger of hope, and we see it every single day

169
0:10:45.42,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in the resistant anger of women and marginalized people.

170
0:10:49.833,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's related to compassion and empathy and love,

171
0:10:54.358,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and we should recognize that anger as well.

172
0:10:59.643,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The issue is that societies that don't respect women's anger don't respect women.

173
0:11:07.543,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The real danger of our anger isn't that it will break bonds or plates.

174
0:11:14.167,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's that it exactly shows how seriously we take ourselves,

175
0:11:19.297,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and we expect other people to take us seriously as well.

176
0:11:24.074,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When that happens, chances are very good

177
0:11:27.958,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that women will be able to smile when they want to.

178
0:11:33.285,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

179
0:11:34.698,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Thank you.

180
0:11:35.873,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Applause) (Cheers)

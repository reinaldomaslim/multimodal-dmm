1
0:00:12.856,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to introduce you to an amazing woman.

2
0:00:15.69,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Her name is Davinia.

3
0:00:18.444,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Davinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18,

4
0:00:22.873,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and now lives just outside of Washington, DC.

5
0:00:26.262,000 --> 0:00:28,000
She's not a high-powered political staffer,

6
0:00:29.088,000 --> 0:00:3,000
nor a lobbyist.

7
0:00:30.676,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable,

8
0:00:33.629,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but she's having the most remarkable impact.

9
0:00:36.471,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What's incredible about Davinia

10
0:00:38.015,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is that she's willing to spend time every single week

11
0:00:40.902,000 --> 0:00:42,000
focused on people who are not her:

12
0:00:43.331,000 --> 0:00:47,000
people not her in her neighborhood, her state, nor even in her country --

13
0:00:47.734,000 --> 0:00:49,000
people she'd likely never meet.

14
0:00:49.991,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Davinia's impact started a few years ago

15
0:00:51.955,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook,

16
0:00:54.723,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and asked them to donate their pennies

17
0:00:56.93,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so she could fund girls' education.

18
0:00:59.397,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She wasn't expecting a huge response,

19
0:01:01.828,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but 700,000 pennies later,

20
0:01:04.635,000 --> 0:01:07,000
she's now sent over 120 girls to school.

21
0:01:07.975,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When we spoke last week,

22
0:01:09.186,000 --> 0:01:12,000
she told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank

23
0:01:12.248,000 --> 0:01:16,000
every time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies.

24
0:01:17.042,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now -- Davinia is not alone.

25
0:01:20.161,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Far from it.

26
0:01:21.717,000 --> 0:01:23,000
She's part of a growing movement.

27
0:01:24.027,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And there's a name for people like Davinia:

28
0:01:26.663,000 --> 0:01:27,000
global citizens.

29
0:01:28.935,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost

30
0:01:33.43,000 --> 0:01:36,000
not as a member of a state, a tribe or a nation,

31
0:01:37.256,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but as a member of the human race,

32
0:01:39.467,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and someone who is prepared to act on that belief,

33
0:01:44.331,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to tackle our world's greatest challenges.

34
0:01:47.25,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Our work is focused on finding,

35
0:01:49.727,000 --> 0:01:51,000
supporting and activating global citizens.

36
0:01:52.634,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They exist in every country

37
0:01:54.556,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and among every demographic.

38
0:01:57.008,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I want to make the case to you today

39
0:01:58.794,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that the world's future depends on global citizens.

40
0:02:01.896,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world,

41
0:02:06.222,000 --> 0:02:08,000
then every single one of the major challenges we face --

42
0:02:08.981,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from poverty, climate change, gender inequality --

43
0:02:12.603,000 --> 0:02:14,000
these issues become solvable.

44
0:02:14.811,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They are ultimately global issues,

45
0:02:17.431,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and they can ultimately only be solved

46
0:02:19.336,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.

47
0:02:24.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, some people's immediate reaction to this idea

48
0:02:27.256,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening.

49
0:02:31.561,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I'd like to share with you a little of my story today,

50
0:02:34.64,000 --> 0:02:35,000
how I ended up here,

51
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:37,000
how it connects with Davinia

52
0:02:38.187,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and, hopefully, with you.

53
0:02:40.256,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,

54
0:02:42.096,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I was one of those seriously irritating little kids

55
0:02:45.459,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"

56
0:02:47.807,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You might have been one yourself.

57
0:02:49.426,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I used to ask my mum the most annoying questions.

58
0:02:52.822,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I'd ask her questions like, "Mum, why I can't I dress up

59
0:02:55.645,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and play with puppets all day?"

60
0:02:57.596,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Why do you want fries with that?"

61
0:02:59.936,000 --> 0:03:,000
"What is a shrimp,

62
0:03:01.15,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie?"

63
0:03:03.846,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:04.871,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"And mum -- this haircut.

65
0:03:06.703,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Why?"

66
0:03:07.9,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:10.126,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The worst haircut, I think.

68
0:03:13.364,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Still terrible.

69
0:03:14.539,000 --> 0:03:16,000
As a "why" kid, I thought I could change the world,

70
0:03:17.365,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and it was impossible to convince me otherwise.

71
0:03:19.989,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And when I was 12 and in my first year of high school,

72
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I started raising money for communities in the developing world.

73
0:03:25.861,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We were a really enthusiastic group of kids,

74
0:03:28.08,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and we raised more money than any other school in Australia.

75
0:03:31.365,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more.

76
0:03:34.977,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It was 1998.

77
0:03:36.915,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila.

78
0:03:40.626,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It was there I became friends with Sonny Boy,

79
0:03:44.38,000 --> 0:03:47,000
who lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage.

80
0:03:48.617,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.

81
0:03:50.65,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But don't let the romance of that name fool you,

82
0:03:52.959,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill

83
0:03:55.344,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day

84
0:03:59.709,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to find something, anything of value.

85
0:04:03.304,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever,

86
0:04:06.604,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because when it came time to go to sleep,

87
0:04:08.651,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom

88
0:04:12.422,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with myself, Sonny Boy, and the rest of his family,

89
0:04:15.352,000 --> 0:04:16,000
seven of us in this long line,

90
0:04:16.987,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with the smell of rubbish all around us

91
0:04:19.405,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and cockroaches crawling all around.

92
0:04:21.952,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I didn't sleep a wink,

93
0:04:23.255,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but I lay awake thinking to myself,

94
0:04:24.988,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Why should anyone have to live like this

95
0:04:27.494,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when I have so much?

96
0:04:29.29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Why should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams

97
0:04:32.06,000 --> 0:04:34,000
be determined by where he's born,

98
0:04:34.13,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'"

99
0:04:37.197,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I just didn't get it,

100
0:04:38.978,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I needed to understand why.

101
0:04:41.656,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, I only later came to understand

102
0:04:44.026,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines

103
0:04:46.478,000 --> 0:04:5,000
was the result of decisions made or not made, man-made,

104
0:04:50.811,000 --> 0:04:53,000
by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments

105
0:04:54.24,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart.

106
0:04:57.429,000 --> 0:05:,000
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have.

107
0:05:01.253,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy,

108
0:05:03.878,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars

109
0:05:06.594,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived,

110
0:05:09.706,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because the core of the problem lay elsewhere.

111
0:05:12.214,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And as I worked on community development projects over the coming years

112
0:05:15.897,000 --> 0:05:16,000
trying to help build schools,

113
0:05:17.763,000 --> 0:05:2,000
train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,

114
0:05:20.828,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I came to see that community development

115
0:05:23.289,000 --> 0:05:25,000
should be driven by communities themselves,

116
0:05:25.869,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and that although charity is necessary, it's not sufficient.

117
0:05:29.646,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We need to confront these challenges

118
0:05:31.531,000 --> 0:05:33,000
on a global scale and in a systemic way.

119
0:05:34.221,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And the best thing I could do

120
0:05:35.69,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home

121
0:05:39.221,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change.

122
0:05:43.315,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That's why, a few years later,

123
0:05:45.339,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I joined with a group of college friends

124
0:05:47.632,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia.

125
0:05:51.447,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We had this dream of staging this small concert

126
0:05:54.849,000 --> 0:05:57,000
around the time of the G20 with local Aussie artists,

127
0:05:58.746,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it suddenly exploded one day

128
0:06:00.422,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when we got a phone call from Bono, the Edge and Pearl Jam,

129
0:06:04.048,000 --> 0:06:07,000
who all agreed to headline our concert.

130
0:06:07.341,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I got a little bit excited that day, as you can see.

131
0:06:09.966,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:11.928,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But to our amazement,

133
0:06:13.231,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the Australian government heard our collective voices,

134
0:06:16.347,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and they agreed to double investment into global health and development --

135
0:06:20.065,000 --> 0:06:22,000
an additional 6.2 billion dollars.

136
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It felt like --

137
0:06:24.479,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:28.962,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It felt like this incredible validation.

139
0:06:31.579,000 --> 0:06:34,000
By rallying citizens together, we helped persuade our government

140
0:06:34.969,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to do the unthinkable,

141
0:06:36.479,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders.

142
0:06:40.965,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But here's the thing:

143
0:06:43.156,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it didn't last.

144
0:06:44.999,000 --> 0:06:45,000
See, there was a change in government,

145
0:06:46.919,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and six years later, all that new money

146
0:06:49.631,000 --> 0:06:5,000
disappeared.

147
0:06:51.542,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What did we learn?

148
0:06:53.703,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We learned that one-off spikes are not enough.

149
0:06:57.225,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We needed a sustainable movement,

150
0:06:59.709,000 --> 0:07:02,000
not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician

151
0:07:03.717,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or the hint of an economic downturn.

152
0:07:06.018,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And it needed to happen everywhere;

153
0:07:08.144,000 --> 0:07:11,000
otherwise, every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism

154
0:07:12.073,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone.

155
0:07:17.405,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And so this is what we embarked upon.

156
0:07:20.103,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And as we embarked upon this challenge, we asked ourselves,

157
0:07:23.104,000 --> 0:07:26,000
how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army

158
0:07:26.625,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to win these fights for the long term?

159
0:07:29.419,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We could only think of one way.

160
0:07:32.034,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement

161
0:07:34.769,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign

162
0:07:37.69,000 --> 0:07:38,000
into long-term passion.

163
0:07:39.822,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It had to be part of their identity.

164
0:07:42.319,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal.

165
0:07:47.836,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And there was only one name for it:

166
0:07:50.359,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Global Citizen.

167
0:07:52.241,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But this is not about any one organization.

168
0:07:55.295,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is about citizens taking action.

169
0:07:58.041,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And research data tells us

170
0:07:59.826,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that of the total population who even care about global issues,

171
0:08:04.081,000 --> 0:08:07,000
only 18 percent have done anything about it.

172
0:08:08.237,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's not that people don't want to act.

173
0:08:10.595,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's often that they don't know how to take action,

174
0:08:13.05,000 --> 0:08:16,000
or that they believe that their actions will have no effect.

175
0:08:16.175,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens

176
0:08:19.724,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in dozens of countries

177
0:08:21.409,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically.

178
0:08:24.732,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And as we did so, we discovered something really thrilling,

179
0:08:28.261,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that when you make global citizenship your mission,

180
0:08:31.237,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies.

181
0:08:34.743,000 --> 0:08:37,000
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global.

182
0:08:38.632,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, too, is climate change,

183
0:08:40.52,000 --> 0:08:42,000
human rights, gender equality,

184
0:08:43.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
even conflict.

185
0:08:44.73,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder

186
0:08:47.346,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues.

187
0:08:51.316,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But how did we actually go about recruiting

188
0:08:53.377,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and engaging those global citizens?

189
0:08:55.327,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, we used the universal language:

190
0:08:59.034,000 --> 0:09:,000
music.

191
0:09:00.287,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We launched the Global Citizen Festival

192
0:09:02.574,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in the heart of New York City in Central Park,

193
0:09:05.448,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate.

194
0:09:09.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We made sure that these festivals coincided

195
0:09:11.58,000 --> 0:09:13,000
with the UN General Assembly meeting,

196
0:09:13.745,000 --> 0:09:15,000
so that leaders who need to hear our voices

197
0:09:16.223,000 --> 0:09:17,000
couldn't possible ignore them.

198
0:09:18.828,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But there was a twist:

199
0:09:20.884,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you couldn't buy a ticket.

200
0:09:22.563,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You had to earn it.

201
0:09:24.22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You had to take action on behalf of a global cause,

202
0:09:27.221,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify.

203
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Activism is the currency.

204
0:09:34.079,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing.

205
0:09:38.503,000 --> 0:09:42,000
For me, citizenship means you have to act, and that's what we required.

206
0:09:42.804,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And amazingly, it worked.

207
0:09:44.789,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens in the New York area alone

208
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:5,000
earned enough points to qualify.

209
0:09:51.447,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Globally, we've now signed up citizens in over 150 countries around the world.

210
0:09:55.835,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And last year, we signed up more than 100,000 new members

211
0:09:59.271,000 --> 0:10:,000
each and every week of the whole year.

212
0:10:01.708,000 --> 0:10:05,000
See, we don't need to create global citizens from nothing.

213
0:10:05.835,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We're already everywhere.

214
0:10:07.788,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We just need to be organized

215
0:10:09.991,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and motivated to start acting.

216
0:10:12.229,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia,

217
0:10:15.348,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012.

218
0:10:19.925,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Here's what she did.

219
0:10:21.587,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It wasn't rocket science.

220
0:10:23.537,000 --> 0:10:25,000
She started writing letters,

221
0:10:25.837,000 --> 0:10:27,000
emailing politicians' offices.

222
0:10:28.147,000 --> 0:10:3,000
She volunteered her time in her local community.

223
0:10:31.166,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That's when she got active on social media

224
0:10:33.802,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and started to collect pennies --

225
0:10:36.056,000 --> 0:10:37,000
a lot of pennies.

226
0:10:38.264,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now, maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you.

227
0:10:42.252,000 --> 0:10:43,000
How will that achieve anything?

228
0:10:44.502,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Well, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone.

229
0:10:48.22,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Her actions, alongside 142,000 other global citizens',

230
0:10:52.674,000 --> 0:10:54,000
led the US government to double their investment

231
0:10:55.339,000 --> 0:10:56,000
into Global Partnership for Education.

232
0:10:57.194,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And here's Dr. Raj Shah,

233
0:10:58.757,000 --> 0:11:,000
the head of USAID, making that announcement.

234
0:11:01.283,000 --> 0:11:04,000
See, when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other,

235
0:11:05.146,000 --> 0:11:07,000
it's amazing to see their collective power.

236
0:11:07.849,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Global citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank

237
0:11:11.285,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to boost their investment into water and sanitation.

238
0:11:13.984,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage

239
0:11:18.048,000 --> 0:11:19,000
at Global Citizen,

240
0:11:19.334,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment

241
0:11:22.864,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019.

242
0:11:28.494,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Global citizens encouraged by the late-night host Stephen Colbert

243
0:11:32.734,000 --> 0:11:34,000
launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.

244
0:11:35.71,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Erna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, got the message,

245
0:11:38.941,000 --> 0:11:41,000
committing to double investment into girls' education.

246
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Global citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian, UK,

247
0:11:46.259,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and Australian governments

248
0:11:47.684,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to boost their investment into polio eradication.

249
0:11:50.57,000 --> 0:11:54,000
They got together and committed 665 million dollars.

250
0:11:56.309,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But despite all of this momentum,

251
0:11:59.277,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we face some huge challenges.

252
0:12:02.008,000 --> 0:12:03,000
See, you might be thinking to yourself,

253
0:12:03.912,000 --> 0:12:05,000
how can we possibly persuade world leaders

254
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to sustain a focus on global issues?

255
0:12:09.474,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Indeed, the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said,

256
0:12:14.581,000 --> 0:12:15,000
"All politics is local."

257
0:12:17.762,000 --> 0:12:19,000
That's what always got politicians elected:

258
0:12:20.559,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to seek, gain and hold onto power

259
0:12:23.605,000 --> 0:12:26,000
through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests.

260
0:12:28.185,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I experienced this for the first time when I was 21 years old.

261
0:12:33.113,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I took a meeting

262
0:12:34.519,000 --> 0:12:38,000
with a then-Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless --

263
0:12:39.655,000 --> 0:12:4,000
[Alexander Downer]

264
0:12:40.97,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

265
0:12:43.515,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And behind closed doors,

266
0:12:44.761,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty.

267
0:12:47.261,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I said, "Minister -- Australia has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

268
0:12:51.204,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

269
0:12:53.917,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We can do this."

270
0:12:55.806,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And he paused,

271
0:12:57.268,000 --> 0:12:59,000
looked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes,

272
0:13:00.465,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and he said, "Hugh,

273
0:13:01.957,000 --> 0:13:03,000
no one gives a funk about foreign aid."

274
0:13:04.615,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Except he didn't use the word "funk."

275
0:13:07.528,000 --> 0:13:08,000
He went on.

276
0:13:08.713,000 --> 0:13:1,000
He said we need to look after our own backyard first.

277
0:13:11.872,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is, I believe,

278
0:13:13.059,000 --> 0:13:15,000
outdated, even dangerous thinking.

279
0:13:16.059,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Or as my late grandfather would say,

280
0:13:17.956,000 --> 0:13:18,000
complete BS.

281
0:13:19.958,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy

282
0:13:22.971,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another.

283
0:13:26.501,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another.

284
0:13:30.699,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The whole world is our backyard,

285
0:13:32.79,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and we ignore it at our peril.

286
0:13:34.695,000 --> 0:13:36,000
See, look what happened when we ignored Rwanda,

287
0:13:36.917,000 --> 0:13:37,000
when we ignore Syria,

288
0:13:38.409,000 --> 0:13:39,000
when we ignore climate change.

289
0:13:40.336,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Political leaders ought to give a "funk"

290
0:13:42.543,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty

291
0:13:45.23,000 --> 0:13:46,000
comes right to our shore.

292
0:13:47.11,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Now, global citizens -- they understand this.

293
0:13:49.744,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We live in a time that favors the global citizen,

294
0:13:53.018,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in an age where every single voice can be heard.

295
0:13:55.954,000 --> 0:13:56,000
See, do you remember

296
0:13:57.146,000 --> 0:14:,000
when the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year 2000?

297
0:14:00.636,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The most we could do in those days was fire off a letter

298
0:14:03.565,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and wait for the next election.

299
0:14:05.737,000 --> 0:14:06,000
There was no social media.

300
0:14:07.998,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Today, billions of citizens have more tools,

301
0:14:11.237,000 --> 0:14:12,000
more access to information,

302
0:14:13.079,000 --> 0:14:15,000
more capacity to influence than ever before.

303
0:14:16.151,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us.

304
0:14:20.377,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The world has changed,

305
0:14:22.467,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and those of us who look beyond our borders

306
0:14:24.888,000 --> 0:14:26,000
are on the right side of history.

307
0:14:28.063,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So where are we?

308
0:14:29.898,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So we run this amazing festival,

309
0:14:32.289,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we've scored some big policy wins,

310
0:14:34.628,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and citizens are signing up all over the world.

311
0:14:37.817,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But have we achieved our mission?

312
0:14:40.651,000 --> 0:14:41,000
No.

313
0:14:42.285,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We have such a long way to go.

314
0:14:44.946,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But this is the opportunity that I see.

315
0:14:48.414,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The concept of global citizenship,

316
0:14:51.716,000 --> 0:14:56,000
self-evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways,

317
0:14:57.436,000 --> 0:15:01,000
has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live.

318
0:15:02.044,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We, as global citizens,

319
0:15:03.22,000 --> 0:15:07,000
now have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change

320
0:15:07.831,000 --> 0:15:08,000
around the world.

321
0:15:09.554,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So in the months and years ahead,

322
0:15:11.737,000 --> 0:15:14,000
global citizens will hold world leaders accountable

323
0:15:14.805,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development

324
0:15:17.875,000 --> 0:15:18,000
are tracked and implemented.

325
0:15:20.048,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Global citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs

326
0:15:22.95,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to end diseases like polio and malaria.

327
0:15:26.243,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe,

328
0:15:29.434,000 --> 0:15:31,000
increasing the frequency, quality

329
0:15:32.114,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and impact of their actions.

330
0:15:34.851,000 --> 0:15:36,000
These dreams are within reach.

331
0:15:37.503,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Imagine an army of millions

332
0:15:40.067,000 --> 0:15:42,000
growing into tens of millions,

333
0:15:42.288,000 --> 0:15:45,000
connected, informed, engaged

334
0:15:46.638,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and unwilling to take no for an answer.

335
0:15:50.432,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Over all these years,

336
0:15:53.23,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.

337
0:15:56.77,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Sadly, I've been unable to.

338
0:16:00.611,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We met long before social media,

339
0:16:03.479,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and his address has now been relocated by the authorities,

340
0:16:06.267,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as often happens with slums.

341
0:16:09.923,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I'd love to sit down with him,

342
0:16:11.381,000 --> 0:16:12,000
wherever he is,

343
0:16:13.312,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.

344
0:16:18.68,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Thanks to him and so many others,

345
0:16:20.453,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people --

346
0:16:24.752,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world,

347
0:16:28.743,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the global citizens.

348
0:16:31.104,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Global citizens who stand together,

349
0:16:33.973,000 --> 0:16:34,000
who ask the question "Why?,"

350
0:16:36.663,000 --> 0:16:37,000
who reject the naysayers,

351
0:16:38.938,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share.

352
0:16:43.24,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I'm a global citizen.

353
0:16:45.19,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Are you?

354
0:16:46.841,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Thank you.

355
0:16:48.047,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Applause)

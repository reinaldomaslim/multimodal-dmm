1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi everyone.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Thank you.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I want to share with you my latest art project.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's a children's book for the iPad.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's a little quirky and silly.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's called "Pop-It,"

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Music)

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So this is about potty training --

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
as most of you, I hope, know.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You can tickle the rug.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can make the baby poop.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You can do all those fun things.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You can burst bubbles.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You can draw, as everyone should.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
But you know, I have a problem with children's books:

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I think they're full of propaganda.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's not the way I was brought up.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
If you notice carefully,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You don't like it?

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I have to tell you about my childhood.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I went to this very proper Christian school

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I am.

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which was probably the only Hindu house

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
I remember we cried profusely

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
when the little goats we played with in the summer

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
became biriani.

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We all had to fast during Ramadan.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It was a very beautiful time.

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But I must say,

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Babri Masjid --

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
one of the most beautiful mosques in India,

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was demolished by Hindu activists.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This caused major riots in my city.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And for the first time,

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I was affected

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by this communal unrest.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
My little five-year-old kid neighbor

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
comes running in,

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and he says, "Rags, Rags.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He's like, "Huh!"

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You know, my work is inspired

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
by events such as this.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Even in my gallery shows,

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I try and revisit historic events

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like Babri Masjid,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
distill only its emotional residue

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and image my own life.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Imagine history being taught differently.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Remember that children's book

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I have another idea.

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's a children's book about Indian independence --

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
very patriotic.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Applause)

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You have to separate fact from bias, right.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Even my books on children

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have cute, fuzzy animals.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But they're playing geopolitics.

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They're playing out Israel-Palestine,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
India-Pakistan.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You know, I'm making a very important argument.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And my argument [is]

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that the only way for us to teach creativity

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is by teaching children perspectives

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at the earliest stage.

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And conversely,

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
only when you teach perspectives

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
will a child be able to imagine

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and put themselves in the shoes

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of someone who is different from them.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm making an argument that art and creativity

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
are very essential tools in empathy.

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You know, I can't promise my child

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a life without bias --

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we're all biased --

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Thank you very much.

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.258,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula:

2
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."

3
0:00:17.189,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"Share a childhood story."

4
0:00:18.615,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"Divulge a personal secret."

5
0:00:20.646,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"End with an inspiring call to action."

6
0:00:23.441,000 --> 0:00:24,000
No.

7
0:00:24.615,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's not how to think of a TED Talk.

8
0:00:26.736,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In fact, if you overuse those devices,

9
0:00:28.749,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative.

10
0:00:32.916,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common,

11
0:00:36.82,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I would like to share that thing with you,

12
0:00:39.523,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat,

13
0:00:42.222,000 --> 0:00:46,000
listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these.

14
0:00:46.985,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time,

15
0:00:49.446,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and learned directly from them

16
0:00:50.906,000 --> 0:00:52,000
their secrets of what makes for a great talk.

17
0:00:53.256,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And even though these speakers and their topics all seem

18
0:00:56.05,000 --> 0:00:57,000
completely different,

19
0:00:57.225,000 --> 0:01:,000
they actually do have one key common ingredient.

20
0:01:01.318,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And it's this:

21
0:01:03.254,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Your number one task as a speaker

22
0:01:05.889,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift --

23
0:01:10.5,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.

24
0:01:16.034,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Let me show you what I mean.

25
0:01:17.393,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Here's Haley.

26
0:01:18.568,000 --> 0:01:19,000
She is about to give a TED Talk

27
0:01:20.558,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and frankly, she's terrified.

28
0:01:22.425,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!

29
0:01:24.098,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:30.537,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Over the course of 18 minutes,

31
0:01:32.397,000 --> 0:01:35,000
1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other before,

32
0:01:36.385,000 --> 0:01:4,000
are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain

33
0:01:40.529,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and with each other.

34
0:01:41.991,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns.

35
0:01:45.409,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions.

36
0:01:48.299,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There's something even more startling happening.

37
0:01:50.822,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Let's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment.

38
0:01:54.19,000 --> 0:01:58,000
There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle.

39
0:01:58.445,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But look here, right here --

40
0:02:00.276,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a few million of them are linked to each other

41
0:02:03.061,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in a way which represents a single idea.

42
0:02:06.524,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And incredibly, this exact pattern is being recreated in real time

43
0:02:10.588,000 --> 0:02:13,000
inside the minds of everyone listening.

44
0:02:13.69,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That's right; in just a few minutes,

45
0:02:15.874,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a pattern involving millions of neurons

46
0:02:18.261,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is being teleported into 1,200 minds,

47
0:02:21.07,000 --> 0:02:24,000
just by people listening to a voice and watching a face.

48
0:02:24.682,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But wait -- what is an idea anyway?

49
0:02:27.515,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Well, you can think of it as a pattern of information

50
0:02:31.023,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that helps you understand and navigate the world.

51
0:02:34.435,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,

52
0:02:36.435,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from the complex and analytical

53
0:02:38.459,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to the simple and aesthetic.

54
0:02:40.562,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage.

55
0:02:43.816,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids' future.

56
0:02:47.545,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now

57
0:02:50.5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is as important in education as literacy,

58
0:02:53.625,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and we should treat it with the same status.

59
0:02:56.139,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy -- building from bamboo is beautiful.

60
0:02:59.283,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Video) Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us,

61
0:03:01.631,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's strong, it's elegant, it's earthquake-resistant.

62
0:03:05.815,000 --> 0:03:08,000
CA: Chimamanda Adichie -- people are more than a single identity.

63
0:03:09.68,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes,

64
0:03:12.806,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,

65
0:03:17.227,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but that they are incomplete.

66
0:03:19.607,000 --> 0:03:21,000
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,

67
0:03:21.845,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and not just randomly.

68
0:03:23.22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They're carefully linked together.

69
0:03:25.45,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure

70
0:03:28.379,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that is your personal worldview.

71
0:03:30.577,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's your brain's operating system.

72
0:03:32.887,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's how you navigate the world.

73
0:03:34.783,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.

74
0:03:38.592,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, for example, if one little component of your worldview

75
0:03:42.085,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is the idea that kittens are adorable,

76
0:03:44.935,000 --> 0:03:46,000
then when you see this,

77
0:03:47.354,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you'll react like this.

78
0:03:48.958,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But if another component of your worldview

79
0:03:51.059,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is the idea that leopards are dangerous,

80
0:03:53.346,000 --> 0:03:54,000
then when you see this,

81
0:03:54.615,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you'll react a little bit differently.

82
0:03:57.524,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, it's pretty obvious

83
0:03:59.136,000 --> 0:04:02,000
why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial.

84
0:04:03.073,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You need them to be as reliable as possible -- a guide,

85
0:04:06.093,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to the scary but wonderful real world out there.

86
0:04:09.905,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different.

87
0:04:14.198,000 --> 0:04:15,000
For example,

88
0:04:15.408,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how does your worldview react when you see this image:

89
0:04:19.919,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?

90
0:04:22.911,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"A woman of faith," "an expert," maybe even "a sister"?

91
0:04:28.292,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Or "oppressed," "brainwashed,"

92
0:04:32.135,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"a terrorist"?

93
0:04:33.955,000 --> 0:04:34,000
CA: Whatever your answer,

94
0:04:35.373,000 --> 0:04:38,000
there are millions of people out there who would react very differently.

95
0:04:38.794,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So that's why ideas really matter.

96
0:04:40.894,000 --> 0:04:43,000
If communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever,

97
0:04:44.596,000 --> 0:04:46,000
how someone thinks about the world,

98
0:04:46.669,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and shaping their actions both now and well into the future.

99
0:04:51.603,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.

100
0:04:55.508,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So if you accept

101
0:04:56.683,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea

102
0:04:59.437,000 --> 0:05:01,000
inside the minds of your audience,

103
0:05:01.507,000 --> 0:05:04,000
here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:

104
0:05:04.825,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One, limit your talk to just one major idea.

105
0:05:09.157,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Ideas are complex things;

106
0:05:11.014,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you need to slash back your content so that you can focus

107
0:05:14.403,000 --> 0:05:16,000
on the single idea you're most passionate about,

108
0:05:17.18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly.

109
0:05:20.838,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.

110
0:05:24.615,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So pick one idea,

111
0:05:25.886,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and make it the through-line running through your entire talk,

112
0:05:29.111,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so that everything you say links back to it in some way.

113
0:05:33.182,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.

114
0:05:37.523,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience,

115
0:05:41.578,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you have to get their permission to welcome you in.

116
0:05:44.007,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the main tool to achieve that?

117
0:05:46.181,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Curiosity.

118
0:05:47.548,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Stir your audience's curiosity.

119
0:05:49.82,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Use intriguing, provocative questions

120
0:05:52.065,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining.

121
0:05:56.698,000 --> 0:05:59,000
If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview,

122
0:06:00.683,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap.

123
0:06:04.024,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And once you've sparked that desire,

124
0:06:06.087,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it will be so much easier to start building your idea.

125
0:06:10.032,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Three, build your idea, piece by piece,

126
0:06:13.429,000 --> 0:06:16,000
out of concepts that your audience already understands.

127
0:06:17.167,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You use the power of language

128
0:06:18.838,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to weave together concepts that already exist

129
0:06:21.791,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in your listeners' minds --

130
0:06:23.452,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but not your language, their language.

131
0:06:25.77,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You start where they are.

132
0:06:27.23,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with

133
0:06:30.952,000 --> 0:06:32,000
are completely unfamiliar to their audiences.

134
0:06:33.587,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together,

135
0:06:38.785,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,

136
0:06:42.483,000 --> 0:06:45,000
based on an idea that the listener already understands.

137
0:06:46.015,000 --> 0:06:47,000
For example, when Jennifer Kahn

138
0:06:48.024,000 --> 0:06:51,000
wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR,

139
0:06:51.697,000 --> 0:06:53,000
she said, "It's as if, for the first time,

140
0:06:54.007,000 --> 0:06:57,000
you had a word processor to edit DNA.

141
0:06:57.062,000 --> 0:07:01,000
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily."

142
0:07:02.165,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment

143
0:07:06.467,000 --> 0:07:08,000
as it snaps into place in our minds.

144
0:07:08.824,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends,

145
0:07:12.768,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and find out which parts they get confused by.

146
0:07:15.396,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Four, here's the final tip:

147
0:07:17.728,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Make your idea worth sharing.

148
0:07:21.242,000 --> 0:07:23,000
By that I mean, ask yourself the question:

149
0:07:23.919,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"Who does this idea benefit?"

150
0:07:26.489,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I need you to be honest with the answer.

151
0:07:29.474,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If the idea only serves you or your organization,

152
0:07:32.41,000 --> 0:07:35,000
then, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing.

153
0:07:35.711,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The audience will see right through you.

154
0:07:37.846,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But if you believe that the idea has the potential

155
0:07:40.552,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to brighten up someone else's day

156
0:07:42.474,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or change someone else's perspective for the better

157

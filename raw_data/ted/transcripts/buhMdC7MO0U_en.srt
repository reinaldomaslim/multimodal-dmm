2
0:00:17.357,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The murder happened a little over 21 years ago,

3
0:00:21.829,000 --> 0:00:25,000
January the 18th, 1991,

4
0:00:26.108,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in a small

5
0:00:28.369,000 --> 0:00:3,000
bedroom community

6
0:00:30.743,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of Lynwood, California, just a few miles

7
0:00:33.578,000 --> 0:00:35,000
southeast of Los Angeles.

8
0:00:36.076,000 --> 0:00:38,000
A father came out of his house

9
0:00:38.911,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to tell his teenage son and his five friends

10
0:00:42.318,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that it was time for them to stop horsing around

11
0:00:45.097,000 --> 0:00:47,000
on the front lawn and on the sidewalk,

12
0:00:48.007,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to get home, finish their schoolwork,

13
0:00:50.915,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and prepare themselves for bed.

14
0:00:53.661,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And as the father was administering these instructions,

15
0:00:57.231,000 --> 0:01:,000
a car drove by, slowly,

16
0:01:00.569,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and just after it passed the father and the teenagers,

17
0:01:03.471,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a hand went out from the front passenger window,

18
0:01:07.459,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father.

19
0:01:12.721,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the car sped off.

20
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The police,

21
0:01:17.721,000 --> 0:01:2,000
investigating officers, were amazingly efficient.

22
0:01:21.551,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They considered all the usual culprits,

23
0:01:23.981,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:

24
0:01:28.548,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Francisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid

25
0:01:32.126,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who lived about two or three blocks away

26
0:01:34.163,000 --> 0:01:36,000
from where the shooting occurred.

27
0:01:36.898,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,

28
0:01:41.546,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the day after the shooting,

29
0:01:45.13,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,

30
0:01:48.023,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"That's the picture.

31
0:01:50.342,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."

32
0:01:55.729,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had

33
0:01:58.306,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial

34
0:02:03.415,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for a first-degree murder.

35
0:02:06.102,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In the investigation that followed before the actual trial,

36
0:02:09.309,000 --> 0:02:12,000
each of the other five teenagers was shown

37
0:02:12.72,000 --> 0:02:16,000
photographs, the same photo array.

38
0:02:16.768,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The picture that we best can determine was probably

39
0:02:19.592,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the one that they were shown in the photo array

40
0:02:21.864,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.

41
0:02:25.561,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The reason we're not sure absolutely is because

42
0:02:28.997,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of the nature of evidence preservation

43
0:02:33.43,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in our judicial system,

44
0:02:35.714,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)

45
0:02:40.462,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So at the actual trial,

46
0:02:43.368,000 --> 0:02:46,000
all six of the teenagers testified,

47
0:02:46.368,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and indicated the identifications they had made

48
0:02:50.126,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the photo array.

49
0:02:53.602,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,

50
0:02:58.383,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and transported to Folsom Prison.

51
0:03:03.842,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So what's wrong?

52
0:03:05.931,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.

53
0:03:10.697,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Oh yes, no gun was ever found.

54
0:03:14.238,000 --> 0:03:18,000
No vehicle was ever identified as being the one

55
0:03:18.392,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in which the shooter had extended his arm,

56
0:03:21.616,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and no person was ever charged with being the driver

57
0:03:24.901,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of the shooter's vehicle.

58
0:03:28.143,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And Mr. Carrillo's alibi?

59
0:03:32.024,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Which of those parents here in the room might not lie

60
0:03:37.318,000 --> 0:03:39,000
concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter

61
0:03:40.137,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in an investigation of a killing?

62
0:03:46.134,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Sent to prison,

63
0:03:48.856,000 --> 0:03:51,000
adamantly insisting on his innocence,

64
0:03:52.354,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which he has consistently for 21 years.

65
0:03:57.091,000 --> 0:04:,000
So what's the problem?

66
0:04:00.562,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The problems, actually, for this kind of case

67
0:04:03.286,000 --> 0:04:06,000
come manyfold from decades of scientific research

68
0:04:07.195,000 --> 0:04:1,000
involving human memory.

69
0:04:11.097,000 --> 0:04:13,000
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses

70
0:04:13.911,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from the Innocence Project work,

71
0:04:16.118,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where we know that we have, what,

72
0:04:18.815,000 --> 0:04:21,000
250, 280 documented cases now where people have

73
0:04:22.596,000 --> 0:04:26,000
been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,

74
0:04:26.668,000 --> 0:04:32,000
some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,

75
0:04:33.014,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases

76
0:04:36.675,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification

77
0:04:42.946,000 --> 0:04:45,000
testimony during the trial that convicted them.

78
0:04:46.593,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.

79
0:04:51.768,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The other comes from an interesting aspect

80
0:04:53.988,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of human memory that's related to various brain functions

81
0:04:57.191,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here

82
0:04:59.757,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in a simple line:

83
0:05:02.141,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The brain abhors a vacuum.

84
0:05:06.889,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Under the best of observation conditions,

85
0:05:10.799,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the absolute best,

86
0:05:12.671,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we only detect, encode and store in our brains

87
0:05:16.384,000 --> 0:05:19,000
bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,

88
0:05:20.079,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and they're stored in different parts of the brain.

89
0:05:22.408,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So now, when it's important for us to be able to recall

90
0:05:26.563,000 --> 0:05:29,000
what it was that we experienced,

91
0:05:29.584,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we have an incomplete, we have a partial store,

92
0:05:34.862,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and what happens?

93
0:05:37.315,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of

94
0:05:40.139,000 --> 0:05:45,000
motivated processing, the brain fills in information

95
0:05:45.31,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that was not there,

96
0:05:47.735,000 --> 0:05:49,000
not originally stored,

97
0:05:50.185,000 --> 0:05:52,000
from inference, from speculation,

98
0:05:52.729,000 --> 0:05:54,000
from sources of information that came to you,

99
0:05:55.541,000 --> 0:05:58,000
as the observer, after the observation.

100
0:05:58.676,000 --> 0:06:,000
But it happens without awareness such that

101
0:06:00.75,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.

102
0:06:04.384,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's called reconstructed memories.

103
0:06:06.651,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.

104
0:06:10.95,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It was those two considerations, among others --

105
0:06:14.214,000 --> 0:06:18,000
reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility --

106
0:06:18.719,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that was part of the instigation

107
0:06:21.775,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for a group of appeal attorneys

108
0:06:24.224,000 --> 0:06:27,000
led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers

109
0:06:27.696,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to pool their experience and their talents together

110
0:06:31.824,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and petition a superior court

111
0:06:33.661,000 --> 0:06:38,000
for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.

112
0:06:38.731,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,

113
0:06:43.119,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because I had expertise

114
0:06:45.261,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in eyewitness memory identification,

115
0:06:47.381,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which obviously makes sense for this case, right?

116
0:06:50.576,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But also because I have expertise and testify about

117
0:06:53.92,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the nature of human night vision.

118
0:06:58.297,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Well, what's that got to do with this?

119
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Well, when you read through the case materials

120
0:07:04.632,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in this Carrillo case,

121
0:07:07.354,000 --> 0:07:09,000
one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that

122
0:07:10.184,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the investigating officers said the lighting was good

123
0:07:13.674,000 --> 0:07:16,000
at the crime scene, at the shooting.

124
0:07:17.208,000 --> 0:07:2,000
All the teenagers testified during the trial

125
0:07:20.665,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that they could see very well.

126
0:07:24.144,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But this occurred in mid-January,

127
0:07:26.984,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.

128
0:07:32.983,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So when I did the calculations

129
0:07:36.008,000 --> 0:07:38,000
for the lunar data and the solar data

130
0:07:38.22,000 --> 0:07:41,000
at that location on Earth at the time of the incident

131
0:07:41.399,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of the shooting, all right,

132
0:07:43.447,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it was well past the end of civil twilight

133
0:07:46.064,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and there was no moon up that night.

134
0:07:48.32,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon

135
0:07:50.599,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is what you see on the screen right here.

136
0:07:53.183,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The only lighting in that area had to come

137
0:07:56.097,000 --> 0:07:59,000
from artificial sources,

138
0:07:59.367,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction

139
0:08:02.135,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of the scene with photometers, with various measures

140
0:08:04.932,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of illumination and various other measures of

141
0:08:06.906,000 --> 0:08:1,000
color perception, along with special cameras

142
0:08:11.373,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and high-speed film, right?

143
0:08:13.502,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Take all the measurements and record them, right?

144
0:08:16.431,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And then take photographs, and this is what the scene

145
0:08:18.588,000 --> 0:08:19,000
looked like at the time of the shooting

146
0:08:20.023,000 --> 0:08:22,000
from the position of the teenagers

147
0:08:22.489,000 --> 0:08:25,000
looking at the car going by and shooting.

148
0:08:26.311,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This is looking directly across the street

149
0:08:28.616,000 --> 0:08:3,000
from where they were standing.

150
0:08:30.944,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Remember, the investigating officers' report said

151
0:08:33.297,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the lighting was good.

152
0:08:35.53,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The teenagers said they could see very well.

153
0:08:37.964,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is looking down to the east,

154
0:08:41.215,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where the shooting vehicle sped off,

155
0:08:44.911,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and this is the lighting directly behind the father

156
0:08:49.803,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and the teenagers.

157
0:08:52.144,000 --> 0:08:55,000
As you can see, it is at best poor.

158
0:08:56.055,000 --> 0:08:59,000
No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,

159
0:08:59.928,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and in fact, as nice as these pictures are,

160
0:09:03.122,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,

161
0:09:06.583,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and a picture is worth more than a thousand words

162
0:09:09.775,000 --> 0:09:11,000
when you're trying to communicate numbers,

163
0:09:12.175,000 --> 0:09:15,000
abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement

164
0:09:15.447,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.

165
0:09:20.623,000 --> 0:09:23,000
When you present those to people who are not well-versed

166
0:09:23.784,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in those aspects of science and that, they become

167
0:09:26.9,000 --> 0:09:28,000
salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like

168
0:09:29.279,000 --> 0:09:31,000
talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?

169
0:09:32.193,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Their eyes just glaze over, all right?

170
0:09:34.978,000 --> 0:09:38,000
A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,

171
0:09:39.337,000 --> 0:09:41,000
a good communicator, and that's part of the reason

172
0:09:41.496,000 --> 0:09:43,000
why we take the pictures, to show not only

173
0:09:43.791,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where the light sources are, and what we call the spill,

174
0:09:46.591,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the distribution, but also so that it's easier

175
0:09:49.22,000 --> 0:09:53,000
for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.

176
0:09:53.255,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So these are some of the pictures that, in fact,

177
0:09:56.128,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I used when I testified,

178
0:09:58.543,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but more importantly were, to me as a scientist,

179
0:10:00.408,000 --> 0:10:01,000
are those readings, the photometer readings,

180
0:10:02.391,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which I can then convert into actual predictions

181
0:10:06.991,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of the visual capability of the human eye

182
0:10:10.511,000 --> 0:10:12,000
under those circumstances,

183
0:10:12.887,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and from my readings that I recorded at the scene

184
0:10:16.535,000 --> 0:10:18,000
under the same solar and lunar conditions

185
0:10:18.775,000 --> 0:10:2,000
at the same time, so on and so forth, right,

186
0:10:21.767,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I could predict

187
0:10:23.173,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that there would be no reliable color perception,

188
0:10:25.365,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which is crucial for face recognition,

189
0:10:27.679,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and that there would be only scotopic vision,

190
0:10:29.991,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which means there would be very little resolution,

191
0:10:31.951,000 --> 0:10:33,000
what we call boundary or edge detection,

192
0:10:34.199,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been

193
0:10:36.514,000 --> 0:10:39,000
totally dilated under this light, the depth of field,

194
0:10:40.319,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the distance at which you can focus and see details,

195
0:10:43.477,000 --> 0:10:48,000
would have been less than 18 inches away.

196
0:10:48.871,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I testified to that to the court,

197
0:10:51.375,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and while the judge was very attentive,

198
0:10:53.808,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it had been a very, very long hearing

199
0:10:56.415,000 --> 0:11:,000
for this petition for a retrial, and as a result,

200
0:11:01.159,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I noticed out of the corner of my eye

201
0:11:02.919,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need

202
0:11:07.064,000 --> 0:11:09,000
a little more of a nudge

203
0:11:09.127,000 --> 0:11:11,000
than just more numbers.

204
0:11:11.635,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And here I became a bit audacious,

205
0:11:13.927,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and I turned

206
0:11:15.447,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and I asked the judge,

207
0:11:17.839,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I said, "Your Honor, I think you should go out

208
0:11:20.247,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and look at the scene yourself."

209
0:11:22.951,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare

210
0:11:26.092,000 --> 0:11:28,000
than a request — (Laughter) —

211
0:11:28.496,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage

212
0:11:32.943,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that he said, "Yes, I will."

213
0:11:36.559,000 --> 0:11:39,000
A shocker in American jurisprudence.

214
0:11:40.551,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So in fact, we found the same identical conditions,

215
0:11:43.023,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we reconstructed the entire thing again,

216
0:11:45.064,000 --> 0:11:49,000
he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers

217
0:11:49.074,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)

218
0:11:54.231,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We had him stand actually slightly in the street,

219
0:11:59.285,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,

220
0:12:02.465,000 --> 0:12:04,000
than the actual teenagers were,

221
0:12:05.207,000 --> 0:12:07,000
so he stood a few feet from the curb

222
0:12:07.431,000 --> 0:12:09,000
toward the middle of the street.

223
0:12:10.043,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We had a car that came by,

224
0:12:12.96,000 --> 0:12:16,000
same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?

225
0:12:17.911,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It had a driver and a passenger,

226
0:12:19.848,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and after the car had passed the judge by,

227
0:12:23.671,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the passenger extended his hand,

228
0:12:27.185,000 --> 0:12:31,000
pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,

229
0:12:31.759,000 --> 0:12:33,000
just as the teenagers had described it, right?

230
0:12:33.978,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,

231
0:12:36.831,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so he had a black object in his hand that was similar

232
0:12:39.249,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to the gun that was described.

233
0:12:41.228,000 --> 0:12:43,000
He pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.

234
0:12:44.074,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge.

235
0:12:51.173,000 --> 0:12:53,000
There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side

236
0:12:54.085,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and pointed back at you.

237
0:12:56.458,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That's 30 feet away.

238
0:12:58.423,000 --> 0:13:,000
Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car

239
0:13:00.615,000 --> 0:13:02,000
was 15 feet away when it shot.

240
0:13:03.191,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Okay. There's 15 feet.

241
0:13:06.855,000 --> 0:13:1,000
At this point, I became a little concerned.

242
0:13:11.025,000 --> 0:13:15,000
This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.

243
0:13:15.759,000 --> 0:13:19,000
He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.

244
0:13:20.047,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.

245
0:13:23.316,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this,

246
0:13:26.817,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and after he looked at this reenactment,

247
0:13:29.857,000 --> 0:13:3,000
he turned to me and he says,

248
0:13:30.937,000 --> 0:13:33,000
"Is there anything else you want me to look at?"

249
0:13:34.195,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was

250
0:13:38.69,000 --> 0:13:4,000
emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had

251
0:13:41.647,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,

252
0:13:45.343,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or whether it was just sheer stupidity,

253
0:13:47.598,000 --> 0:13:49,000
which is what the defense lawyers thought — (Laughter) —

254
0:13:50.423,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when they heard me say,

255
0:13:52.175,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there

256
0:13:54.879,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and I want the car to go around the block again

257
0:13:59.215,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and I want it to come and I want it to stop

258
0:14:02.569,000 --> 0:14:06,000
right in front of you, three to four feet away,

259
0:14:06.759,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I want the passenger to extend his hand

260
0:14:10.215,000 --> 0:14:12,000
with a black object and point it right at you,

261
0:14:12.231,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and you can look at it as long as you want."

262
0:14:17.951,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And that's what he saw. (Laughter)

263
0:14:22.378,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You'll notice, which was also in my test report,

264
0:14:26.218,000 --> 0:14:28,000
all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,

265
0:14:28.863,000 --> 0:14:29,000
which means that the shooter's face would

266
0:14:30.606,000 --> 0:14:32,000
have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.

267
0:14:33.222,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Furthermore, the roof of the car

268
0:14:35.124,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car

269
0:14:39.398,000 --> 0:14:42,000
which is making it darker.

270
0:14:42.728,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And this is three to four feet away.

271
0:14:46.84,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Why did I take the risk?

272
0:14:49.968,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.

273
0:14:54.197,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Three to four feet, it might as well have been

274
0:14:55.864,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a football field away.

275
0:15:00.336,000 --> 0:15:02,000
This is what he saw.

276
0:15:02.544,000 --> 0:15:05,000
He went back, there was a few more days of evidence

277
0:15:06.344,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that was heard. At the end of it,

278
0:15:08.648,000 --> 0:15:1,000
he made the judgment that he was going to grant

279
0:15:11.276,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the petition for a retrial.

280
0:15:14.354,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo

281
0:15:16.832,000 --> 0:15:18,000
so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense

282
0:15:19.819,000 --> 0:15:25,000
if the prosecution decided to retry him.

283
0:15:25.838,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Which they decided not to.

284
0:15:28.148,000 --> 0:15:33,000
He is now a freed man. (Applause)

285
0:15:33.209,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

286
0:15:37.152,000 --> 0:15:42,000
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.

287
0:15:42.256,000 --> 0:15:46,000
He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,

288
0:15:46.331,000 --> 0:15:5,000
right? And she had a little baby boy.

289
0:15:50.416,000 --> 0:15:52,000
He and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach

290
0:15:53.097,000 --> 0:15:59,000
right now taking classes. (Applause)

291
0:15:59.285,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And what does this example --

292
0:16:03.248,000 --> 0:16:07,000
what's important to keep in mind for ourselves?

293
0:16:07.592,000 --> 0:16:1,000
First of all, there's a long history of antipathy

294
0:16:11.288,000 --> 0:16:13,000
between science and the law

295
0:16:13.368,000 --> 0:16:15,000
in American jurisprudence.

296
0:16:15.768,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance

297
0:16:19.216,000 --> 0:16:23,000
over decades of experience as a forensic expert

298
0:16:23.552,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of just trying to get science into the courtroom.

299
0:16:28.058,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it.

300
0:16:32.992,000 --> 0:16:35,000
One suggestion is that all of us become much more

301
0:16:36.379,000 --> 0:16:38,000
attuned to the necessity, through policy,

302
0:16:39.248,000 --> 0:16:41,000
through procedures,

303
0:16:41.304,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to get more science in the courtroom,

304
0:16:44.488,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and I think one large step toward that

305
0:16:46.799,000 --> 0:16:47,000
is more requirements,

306
0:16:48.641,000 --> 0:16:5,000
with all due respect to the law schools,

307
0:16:51.2,000 --> 0:16:56,000
of science, technology, engineering, mathematics

308
0:16:56.311,000 --> 0:16:57,000
for anyone going into the law,

309
0:16:58.288,000 --> 0:17:01,000
because they become the judges.

310
0:17:01.912,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Think about how we select our judges in this country.

311
0:17:04.96,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It's very different than most other cultures. All right?

312
0:17:08.32,000 --> 0:17:1,000
The other one that I want to suggest,

313
0:17:10.73,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the caution that all of us have to have,

314
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I constantly have to remind myself,

315
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:18,000
about just how accurate are the memories

316
0:17:18.103,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that we know are true, that we believe in?

317
0:17:23.472,000 --> 0:17:26,000
There is decades of research,

318
0:17:26.856,000 --> 0:17:3,000
examples and examples of cases like this,

319
0:17:31.024,000 --> 0:17:32,000
where individuals

320
0:17:32.992,000 --> 0:17:35,000
really, really believe. None of those teenagers

321
0:17:36.504,000 --> 0:17:37,000
who identified him

322
0:17:38.336,000 --> 0:17:41,000
thought that they were picking the wrong person.

323
0:17:41.612,000 --> 0:17:44,000
None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.

324
0:17:44.966,000 --> 0:17:46,000
We all have to be very careful.

325
0:17:47.098,000 --> 0:17:5,000
All our memories are reconstructed memories.

326
0:17:50.738,000 --> 0:17:52,000
They are the product of what we originally experienced

327
0:17:53.136,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and everything that's happened afterwards.

328
0:17:55.869,000 --> 0:17:57,000
They're dynamic.

329
0:17:57.92,000 --> 0:17:59,000
They're malleable. They're volatile,

330
0:18:00.408,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,

331
0:18:04.432,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that the accuracy of our memories

332
0:18:07.752,000 --> 0:18:1,000
is not measured in how vivid they are

333
0:18:11.256,000 --> 0:18:16,000
nor how certain you are that they're correct.

334
0:18:16.387,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Thank you. (Applause)

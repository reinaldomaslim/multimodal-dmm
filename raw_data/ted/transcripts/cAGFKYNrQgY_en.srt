1
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I am a papercutter.

4
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I cut stories.

6
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So my process is very straightforward.

7
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I take a piece of paper,

8
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I visualize my story,

9
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.

10
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And as my image

11
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is already inside the paper,

12
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I just have to remove

13
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
what's not from that story.

14
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So I didn't come to papercutting

15
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in a straight line.

16
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In fact,

17
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I see it more as a spiral.

18
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was not born

19
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with a blade in my hand.

20
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I don't remember papercutting as a child.

21
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As a teenager,

22
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I was sketching, drawing,

23
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I wanted to be an artist.

24
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But I was also a rebel.

25
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I left everything

26
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and went for a long series of odd jobs.

27
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So among them,

28
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I have been a shepherdess,

29
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a truck driver,

30
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a factory worker,

31
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
a cleaning lady.

32
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I worked in tourism for one year

33
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in Mexico,

34
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
one year in Egypt.

35
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I moved for two years

36
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in Taiwan.

37
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And then I settled in New York

38
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where I became a tour guide.

39
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I still worked as a tour leader,

40
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
traveled back and forth

41
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in China, Tibet and Central Asia.

42
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40,

43
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I decided it's time

44
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to start as an artist.

45
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I chose papercutting

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because paper is cheap,

48
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it's light,

49
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and you can use it

50
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in a lot of different ways.

51
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I chose the language of silhouette

52
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because graphically it's very efficient.

53
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it's also just getting to the essential of things.

54
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So the word "silhouette"

55
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
comes from a minister of finance,

56
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Etienne de Silhouette.

57
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And he slashed so many budgets

58
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that people said they couldn't afford

59
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
paintings anymore,

60
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and they needed to have their portrait

61
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"a la silhouette."

62
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I made series of images, cuttings,

64
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I assembled them in portfolios.

65
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And people told me --

66
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like these 36 views of the Empire State building --

67
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they told me, "You're making artist books."

68
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So artist books have a lot of definitions.

69
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They come in a lot of different shapes.

70
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But to me,

71
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
they are fascinating objects

72
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to visually narrate a story.

73
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They can be with words

74
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
or without words.

75
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I have a passion

76
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
for images and for words.

77
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I love pun

78
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and the relation to the unconscious.

79
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I love oddities of languages.

80
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages,

81
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but never mastered them.

82
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So I'm always looking

83
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for the false cognates

84
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or identical words in different languages.

85
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.

86
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And my daily language is English.

87
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I did a series of work

88
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
where it was identical words

89
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in French and in English.

90
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So one of these works

91
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is the "Spelling Spider."

92
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So the Spelling Spider

93
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is a cousin of the spelling bee.

94
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But it's much more connected to the Web.

96
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And this spider

98
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
spins a bilingual alphabet.

99
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So you can read "architecture active"

100
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or "active architecture."

101
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So this spider goes through the whole alphabet

102
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with identical adjectives and substantives.

103
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So if you don't know one of these languages,

104
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's instant learning.

105
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And one ancient form of the book

106
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is scrolls.

107
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So scrolls are very convenient,

108
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because you can create a large image

109
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
on a very small table.

110
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So the unexpected consequences of that

111
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is that you only see one part of your image,

112
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
so it makes a very freestyle architecture.

113
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I'm making all those kinds of windows.

114
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So it's to look beyond the surface.

115
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's to have a look

116
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
at different worlds.

117
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And very often I've been an outsider.

118
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
So I want to see how things work

119
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and what's happening.

120
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So each window

121
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is an image

122
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and is a world

123
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that I often revisit.

124
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I revisit this world

125
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
thinking about the image

126
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or cliché about what we want to do,

127
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and what are the words, colloquialisms,

128
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that we have with the expressions.

129
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's all if.

130
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So what if we were living in balloon houses?

131
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It would make a very uplifting world.

132
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.

133
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It would be so light.

134
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So sometimes I view from the inside,

135
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
like EgoCentriCity

136
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the inner circles.

137
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Sometimes it's a global view,

138
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to see our common roots

139
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and how we can use them to catch dreams.

140
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And we can use them also

141
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as a safety net.

142
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And my inspirations

143
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
are very eclectic.

144
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'm influenced by everything I read,

145
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
everything I see.

146
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I have some stories that are humorous,

147
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
like "Dead Beats."

148
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Other ones are historical.

150
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Here it's "CandyCity."

151
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's a non-sugar-coated

152
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
history of sugar.

153
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It goes from slave trade

154
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to over-consumption of sugar

155
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with some sweet moments in between.

156
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news,

157
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

158
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Other times, it's not even my stories.

159
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
People tell me their lives,

160
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
their memories, their aspirations,

161
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and I create a mindscape.

162
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I channel their history

163
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
[so that] they have a place to go back

164
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to look at their life and its possibilities.

165
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I call them Freudian cities.

166
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I cannot speak for all my images,

167
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
so I'll just go through a few of my worlds

168
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
just with the title.

169
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"ModiCity."

170
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"ElectriCity."

171
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle."

172
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"ReefCity."

173
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"A Web of Time."

174
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"Chaos City."

175
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Daily Battles."

176
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
"FeliCity."

177
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"Floating Islands."

178
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And at one point,

179
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I had to do "The Whole Nine Yards."

180
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.

181
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So in life and in papercutting,

183
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
everything is connected.

184
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
One story leads to another.

185
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I was also interested

186
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in the physicality of this format,

187
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because you have to walk to see it.

188
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And parallel to my cutting

189
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is my running.

190
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I started with small images,

191
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I started with a few miles.

192
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Larger images, I started to run marathons.

193
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.

194
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.

195
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I still feel I'm running,

196
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it's just the training

197
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to become a long-distance papercutter.

198
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And running gives me a lot of energy.

200
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon

201
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
at the Museum of Arts and Design

202
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in New York City.

203
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The result is "Hells and Heavens."

204
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's two panels 13 ft. high.

205
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They were installed in the museum on two floors,

206
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but in fact, it's a continuous image.

207
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And I call it "Hells and Heavens"

208
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because it's daily hells and daily heavens.

209
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
There is no border in between.

210
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Some people are born in hells,

211
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and against all odds, they make it to heavens.

212
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Other people make the opposite trip.

213
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That's the border.

214
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You have sweatshops in hells.

215
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You have people renting their wings in the heavens.

216
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And then you have all those individual stories

217
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
where sometimes we even have the same action,

218
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the result puts you in hells or in heavens.

219
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So the whole "Hells and Heavens"

220
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is about free will

221
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and determinism.

222
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And in papercutting,

223
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
you have the drawing as the structure itself.

224
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So you can take it off the wall.

225
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Here it's an artist book installation

226
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
called "Identity Project."

227
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's not autobiographical identities.

228
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They are more our social identities.

229
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And then you can just walk behind them

230
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and try them on.

231
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So it's like the different layers

232
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
of what we are made of

233
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and what we present to the world

234
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
as an identity.

235
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
That's another artist book project.

236
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In fact, in the picture, you have two of them.

237
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's one I'm wearing

238
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and one that's on exhibition

239
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.

240
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Why do I call it a book?

241
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It's called "Fashion Statement,"

242
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and there are quotes about fashion,

243
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
so you can read it,

244
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and also,

245
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because the definition of artist book

246
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is very generous.

247
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So artist books, you take them off the wall.

248
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You take them for a walk.

249
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You can also install them as public art.

250
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona,

251
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and it's called "Floating Memories."

252
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So it's regional memories,

253
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and they are just randomly moved by the wind.

254
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I love public art.

255
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And I entered competitions

256
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
for a long time.

257
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
After eight years of rejection,

258
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I was thrilled to get my first commission

259
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with the Percent for Art in New York City.

260
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It was for a merger station

261
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
for emergency workers and firemen.

262
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I made an artist book

263
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that's in stainless steel

264
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
instead of paper.

265
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I called it "Working in the Same Direction."

266
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But I added weathervanes on both sides

267
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to show that they cover all directions.

268
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
With public art,

269
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I could also make cut glass.

270
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.

271
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And each time I make public art,

272
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I want something that's really relevant

273
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to the place it's installed.

274
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So for the subway in New York,

275
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I saw a correspondence

276
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
between riding the subway

277
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and reading.

278
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It is travel in time, travel on time.

279
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And Bronx literature,

280
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
it's all about Bronx writers

281
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and their stories.

282
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Another glass project

283
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is in a public library

284
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
in San Jose, California.

285
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So I made a vegetable point of view

286
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
of the growth of San Jose.

287
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So I started in the center

288
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
with the acorn

289
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
for the Ohlone Indian civilization.

290
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Then I have the fruit from Europe

291
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
for the ranchers.

292
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.

293
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And it's still growing.

294
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So the technique, it's cut,

295
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
sandblasted, etched

296
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and printed glass into architectural glass.

297
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And outside the library,

298
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.

299
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I took library material

300
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that had fruit in their title

301
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I used them to make an orchard walk

302
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with these fruits of knowledge.

303
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I also planted the bibliotree.

304
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So it's a tree,

305
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.

306
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And it's all about international writing systems.

307
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And on the branches

308
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you have library material growing.

309
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
You can also have function and form

310
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
with public art.

311
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.

312
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But you have a bonus with this bench.

313
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts,

314
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
you will walk away

315
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with temporary branding of

316
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the story element on your thighs.

317
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

318
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Another functional work,

319
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's in the south side of Chicago

320
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for a subway station.

321
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today."

322
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It's a story about transformation

323
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and connections.

324
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So it acts as a screen

325
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to protect the rail and the commuter,

326
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and not to have objects falling on the rails.

327
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
To be able to change fences

328
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and window guards into flowers,

329
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
it's fantastic.

330
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And here I've been working for the last three years

331
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
with a South Bronx developer

332
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
to bring art to life

333
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to low-income buildings

334
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and affordable housing.

335
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So each building has its own personality.

336
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood,

337
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.

338
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And for other projects, like in Paris,

339
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
it's about the name of the street.

340
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.

341
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So I brought back the rabbit,

342
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
the dragonfly,

343
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to stay in that street.

344
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And in 2009,

345
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I was asked to make a poster

346
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to be placed in the subway cars in New York City

347
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
for a year.

348
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
So that was a very captive audience.

349
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I wanted to give them an escape.

350
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I created "All Around Town."

351
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
It is a papercutting,

352
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and then after, I added color on the computer.

353
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
So I can call it techno-crafted.

354
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And along the way,

355
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I'm kind of making papercuttings

356
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and adding other techniques.

357
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
But the result is always to have stories.

358
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.

359
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
They have a lot of scenarios.

360
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I don't know the stories.

361
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I take images from our global imagination,

362
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
from cliché, from things we are thinking about,

363
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
from history.

364
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And everybody's a narrator,

365
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
because everybody has a story to tell.

366
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
But more important

367
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
is everybody has to make a story

368
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to make sense of the world.

369
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And in all these universes,

370
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
it's like imagination is the vehicle

371
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to be transported with,

372
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
but the destination is our minds

373
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and how we can reconnect

374
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
with the essential and with the magic.

375
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
And it's what story cutting is all about.

376
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000

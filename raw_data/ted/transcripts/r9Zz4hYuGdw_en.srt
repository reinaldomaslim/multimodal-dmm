1
0:00:13.381,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Something happened

2
0:00:16.571,000 --> 0:00:18,000
while I was studying in the seminary

3
0:00:19.683,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and training to be a priest.

4
0:00:23.703,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I came in contact with a different idea of life.

5
0:00:28.933,000 --> 0:00:32,000
An idea of life that contradicted the main teachings of religion --

6
0:00:33.552,000 --> 0:00:34,000
humanism.

7
0:00:36.294,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Some of you may be wondering, what on earth is humanism?

8
0:00:41.945,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Humanism is a way of thinking and living

9
0:00:44.633,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that emphasizes the agency of human beings.

10
0:00:48.712,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Humanism stresses the fact that we, human beings,

11
0:00:52.181,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are capable of changing the world.

12
0:00:55.014,000 --> 0:00:58,000
That we have the power to make a difference in our lives,

13
0:00:58.919,000 --> 0:01:,000
both individually and collectively,

14
0:01:01.649,000 --> 0:01:03,000
without recourse to some outside force.

15
0:01:05.768,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It may interest you to know that the best humanist lessons I learned

16
0:01:10.934,000 --> 0:01:12,000
were not from reading philosophy books

17
0:01:13.609,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or from poring over humanist manifestos and declarations.

18
0:01:18.363,000 --> 0:01:19,000
No, not at all.

19
0:01:20.791,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The best humanist lesson I learned was from the life of my own parents.

20
0:01:26.79,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My parents come from a poor family background

21
0:01:29.657,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in Mbaise, in southeastern Nigeria.

22
0:01:33.069,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They had limited opportunities.

23
0:01:35.791,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But my parents did not allow the circumstances of their bad upbringing

24
0:01:40.443,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to determine the ambition and dreams for themselves and for their children.

25
0:01:46.577,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My father worked part-time, trained as a teacher,

26
0:01:50.419,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and rose to become a headmaster at a local primary school.

27
0:01:54.862,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My mother dropped out of school quite early,

28
0:01:57.354,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because her mother, my grandmother, could not afford her education.

29
0:02:03.481,000 --> 0:02:05,000
As a parent, my mother worked very hard,

30
0:02:06.442,000 --> 0:02:12,000
combining farming, petty trading and taking care of my siblings and me.

31
0:02:13.807,000 --> 0:02:14,000
By the time I was born --

32
0:02:15.338,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that was shortly after the Nigerian civil war --

33
0:02:18.275,000 --> 0:02:21,000
life was very difficult, a struggle day by day.

34
0:02:23.006,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My family was living in a hut.

35
0:02:25.411,000 --> 0:02:27,000
With the eye of a child, I can still see water

36
0:02:28.323,000 --> 0:02:31,000
dripping from the thatched roof of our house when it rained.

37
0:02:32.252,000 --> 0:02:35,000
My father reared goats to supplement the family income.

38
0:02:36.712,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And part of my duty after school hours or during vacation

39
0:02:40.53,000 --> 0:02:41,000
was to feed these goats.

40
0:02:43.037,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There was no electricity, no pipe with water.

41
0:02:47.387,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We trekked to fetch water from the nearby streams.

42
0:02:50.854,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That was an easy work in the wet season,

43
0:02:53.816,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but kilometers when it was hot and dry.

44
0:02:57.817,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Through hard work and perseverance,

45
0:02:59.549,000 --> 0:03:01,000
my parents were able to erect a block apartment

46
0:03:02.508,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and send my siblings and me to school.

47
0:03:05.254,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They made it possible for us to enjoy a standard of living

48
0:03:08.841,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which they never did

49
0:03:10.245,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and to attain educational levels

50
0:03:12.404,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which they only imagined when they were growing up.

51
0:03:16.172,000 --> 0:03:2,000
My parents' life, their story, is my best lesson in humanism.

52
0:03:22.553,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So as a humanist, I believe that human beings

53
0:03:25.157,000 --> 0:03:28,000
are challengers, not prisoners of faith.

54
0:03:28.252,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Our destinies are in our hands, not predetermined.

55
0:03:32.45,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And it's left for us to shape our lives and destinies

56
0:03:35.538,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to reflect our best hopes and aspirations.

57
0:03:39.506,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I believe that human beings have the power

58
0:03:42.36,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to turn situations of poverty into those of wealth and prosperity.

59
0:03:46.789,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We have the capacity to alleviate suffering,

60
0:03:49.725,000 --> 0:03:52,000
extend life, prevent diseases,

61
0:03:52.972,000 --> 0:03:55,000
cure debilitating ailments, reduce infant mortality

62
0:03:56.355,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and preserve our planet.

63
0:03:58.442,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But we cannot accomplish all these goals by wishful thinking with our eyes closed

64
0:04:03.522,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or by armchair speculation or by expecting salvation from empty sky.

65
0:04:09.654,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In contrast, millions of Africans imagine that their religious faith

66
0:04:14.401,000 --> 0:04:15,000
will help their dream come true,

67
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and they spend so much time praying for miracles

68
0:04:19.546,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and for divine intervention in their lives.

69
0:04:23.3,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In 2009, a Gallup survey in 114 countries

70
0:04:28.252,000 --> 0:04:33,000
revealed that religiosity was highest in the world's poorest nations.

71
0:04:34.029,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In fact, six of the 10 countries where 95 percent of the population

72
0:04:39.577,000 --> 0:04:44,000
said that religion was an important part of their daily lives, were African.

73
0:04:45.411,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In some cases, religion drives many Africans to extraordinary length:

74
0:04:50.196,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to attack other human beings, to commit ritual killing,

75
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
targeting those living with albinism,

76
0:04:57.403,000 --> 0:04:58,000
those with a humpback,

77
0:04:59.101,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and as I recently learned, those with a bald head.

78
0:05:02.109,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In Africa, superstition is widespread,

79
0:05:05.014,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with so many people believing in witchcraft,

80
0:05:07.315,000 --> 0:05:1,000
something that has no basis in reason or in science.

81
0:05:10.902,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Yet alleged witches, usually women, children and elderly persons

82
0:05:16.496,000 --> 0:05:19,000
are still routinely attacked, banished and killed.

83
0:05:19.901,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I've made it part of my life's mission

84
0:05:22.617,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to end witchcraft accusation and witch persecution in Africa.

85
0:05:27.045,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So as a humanist, I believe in a proactive approach to life.

86
0:05:31.759,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The changes that we want cannot be achieved only by dreaming

87
0:05:35.887,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but require doing as well.

88
0:05:37.903,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The challenges that we face cannot go away

89
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
if we recoil and retreat into our shells, wishing and imagining

90
0:05:44.775,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that those problems will somehow magically disappear.

91
0:05:48.926,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The good life that we desire will not fall like manna from heaven.

92
0:05:53.442,000 --> 0:05:57,000
My parents did not erect a block apartment by wishing and dreaming.

93
0:05:58.291,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They worked hard, they failed, they tried again.

94
0:06:02.204,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They toiled with rolled-up sleeves,

95
0:06:04.395,000 --> 0:06:06,000
with their hands deep in debt, they plowed ahead,

96
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
growing their dreams into reality.

97
0:06:10.133,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So as a humanist, I believe we must be adventurous and even daring.

98
0:06:15.504,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The path of success is paved with risk and uncertainties.

99
0:06:19.807,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We have to muster the will and courage to do what people have never done.

100
0:06:24.609,000 --> 0:06:25,000
To think what people have never thought.

101
0:06:26.586,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Envisage what people have never imagined.

102
0:06:28.815,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Go to places human beings have not been to.

103
0:06:31.268,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And succeed where people have tried but failed.

104
0:06:34.958,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We must be ready to explore new frontiers of knowledge and understanding

105
0:06:38.696,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and attempt doing not just what is possible

106
0:06:41.45,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but also what is seemingly impossible.

107
0:06:44.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But I realize that at the end of the day,

108
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:51,000
our efforts do not always yield our desires.

109
0:06:52.649,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We fail, we suffer disappointments and setbacks.

110
0:06:56.863,000 --> 0:07:,000
Some problems, such as wars and conflict, poverty and diseases

111
0:07:01.204,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and other natural and human-made disasters

112
0:07:03.601,000 --> 0:07:05,000
seem as if they may never go away.

113
0:07:06.538,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Solutions to old problems have led to new dangers,

114
0:07:10.149,000 --> 0:07:12,000
new cures to diseases have resulted in new health risks.

115
0:07:13.458,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But the fact that these problems persist

116
0:07:15.942,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and that solutions sometimes create their own problems

117
0:07:18.847,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is not a reason for us to give up or to resign.

118
0:07:22.355,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's not a reason for us to think that our efforts are of no consequence.

119
0:07:26.331,000 --> 0:07:28,000
In fact, there is fulfillment in striving,

120
0:07:29.069,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and trying to provide answers and solutions

121
0:07:32.22,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to the problem humanity faces

122
0:07:34.236,000 --> 0:07:36,000
even when the likely outcome is failure.

123
0:07:37.538,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So as a humanist, I believe we must not despair for humanity.

124
0:07:42.576,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Even in the face of overwhelming difficulties

125
0:07:45.918,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and in the bleakest of circumstances.

126
0:07:48.656,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Human beings are creative beings.

127
0:07:51.179,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We have the power to generate new ideas, new solutions and new cures.

128
0:07:57.696,000 --> 0:08:,000
So why despair when the unexpected knocks on the horizon?

129
0:08:01.776,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It is in our nature to create anew, to be inventive and innovative,

130
0:08:05.482,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so why languish in idle expectation of a savior from above?

131
0:08:10.625,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So it is time for us Africans to take our destiny in our hands

132
0:08:14.149,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and realize we have agency in the scheme of life.

133
0:08:17.006,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We need to put an end to this game of blame

134
0:08:19.959,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that has prevented us from taking full responsibility for our own lives.

135
0:08:23.775,000 --> 0:08:26,000
For too long, we have been prisoners of our past.

136
0:08:27.546,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We have allowed despair and pessimism to drain us,

137
0:08:30.8,000 --> 0:08:32,000
drain our energies, limit our imaginations

138
0:08:33.323,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and dim our vision for a better and brighter future.

139
0:08:37.419,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We have let this continent flounder.

140
0:08:39.411,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Why passing the buck like a Frisbee?

141
0:08:41.744,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We've blamed slavery, colonialism and the new colonialism

142
0:08:44.927,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for the woes we experience, including our own self-inflicted wounds.

143
0:08:48.855,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We have conducted ourselves

144
0:08:50.505,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in ways that seem as if Africa is damned and doomed.

145
0:08:53.727,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And that all these experiences in history

146
0:08:56.003,000 --> 0:09:,000
have irreversibly, irreparably foreclosed the chances and possibility

147
0:09:00.427,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for Africa to emerge, thrive and flourish.

148
0:09:04.744,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We must realize that there is no part of the world

149
0:09:08.141,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that has not been colonized or enslaved in the past.

150
0:09:12.323,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And if other parts of the world have moved on,

151
0:09:15.49,000 --> 0:09:16,000
why can't we, now?

152
0:09:17.53,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So as a humanist, I believe that the past is gone;

153
0:09:22.339,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we cannot change it, we cannot alter it.

154
0:09:24.76,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But the future beckons us on with limitless possibilities

155
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to recreate, reshape and remake our destinies.

156
0:09:31.903,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So let's all of us seize this opportunity.

157
0:09:35.728,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And as my parents did, begin the urgent task

158
0:09:39.236,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of rebuilding Africa, brick by brick.

159
0:09:42.323,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Let's give free reign to our ideas and imaginations,

160
0:09:45.101,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as demonstrated at this TEDGlobal 2017.

161
0:09:49.617,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Let's open our hearts and minds.

162
0:09:52.029,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And exert our energy, intelligence and ingenuity

163
0:09:55.958,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and begin the urgent task of rebuilding Africa

164
0:09:59.427,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and of transforming this continent

165
0:10:01.823,000 --> 0:10:04,000
into a citadel of unrivaled prosperity and civilization.

166
0:10:06.419,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is what I believe as a humanist, as an African humanist.

167
0:10:10.736,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Thank you.

168
0:10:11.934,000 --> 0:10:17,000

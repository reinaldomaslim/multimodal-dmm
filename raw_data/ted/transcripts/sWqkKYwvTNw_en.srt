1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
My name is Lovegrove.

2
0:00:26.24,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents.

3
0:00:30.36,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know --

4
0:00:34.2,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:35.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me,

6
0:00:39.68,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which I'm fighting with all the time.

7
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So to try and get through today,

8
0:00:44.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.

9
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was hanging on to have a pee.

10
0:00:48.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough,

11
0:00:51.32,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that would guide me through the 18 minutes.

12
0:00:53.344,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:55.68,000 --> 0:01:01,000
OK. I am known as Captain Organic

14
0:01:02.2,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position.

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form

16
0:01:10.84,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and how form can touch people's soul and emotion.

17
0:01:16.68,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Not very long ago, not many thousands of years ago,

18
0:01:21.64,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we actually lived in caves,

19
0:01:23.6,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I don't think we've lost that coding system.

20
0:01:27.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We respond so well to form.

21
0:01:31.04,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But I'm interested in creating intelligent form.

22
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm not interested at all in blobism

23
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.

24
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This artificially induced consumerism -- I think it's atrocious.

25
0:01:44.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins,

26
0:01:49.24,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Janine Benyus, James Watson.

27
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively.

28
0:01:55.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps,

29
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:02:,000
but I work in this world where I trust my instincts.

30
0:02:00.96,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology

31
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:12,000
into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.

32
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And we should be developing things -- we should be developing packaging

33
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for ideas which elevate people's perceptions

34
0:02:20.44,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth

35
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and translate into products for everyday use.

36
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, the water bottle.

37
0:02:28.72,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA.

38
0:02:31.4,000 --> 0:02:33,000
DNA: Design, Nature, Art.

39
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
These are the three things that condition my world.

40
0:02:36.005,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.

41
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It shows how observation, curiosity and instinct

42
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
work to create amazing art.

43
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century.

44
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
People like Leonardo -- there have not been many --

45
0:02:56.2,000 --> 0:02:59,000
had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.

46
0:02:59.84,000 --> 0:03:,000
I work from a similar position.

47
0:03:01.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't want to sound pretentious saying that,

48
0:03:03.527,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago --

49
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:09,000
well into the 21st century, 500 years later.

50
0:03:09.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's my impression of water.

51
0:03:12.68,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it:

52
0:03:16.228,000 --> 0:03:18,000
100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.

53
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I use, now, a whole new process.

54
0:03:20.48,000 --> 0:03:21,000
A few years ago I reinvented my process

55
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --

56
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering

57
0:03:30.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with fantastic new ideas of how to create form.

58
0:03:34.44,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is all created digitally.

59
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic.

60
0:03:39.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is what I show to the client to say, "That's what I want to do."

61
0:03:42.503,000 --> 0:03:44,000
At that point, I don't know if that's possible at all.

62
0:03:45.051,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.

63
0:03:50.96,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So we go, we look at the tooling.

64
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We look at how that is produced.

65
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:56,000
These are the invisible things that you never see in your life.

66
0:03:57.777,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is the background noise of industrial design.

67
0:04:00.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra.

68
0:04:04.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It is more valuable than the product in my eyes.

69
0:04:06.463,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I don't have one.

70
0:04:07.869,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself.

71
0:04:10.781,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This is the final product.

72
0:04:12.058,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.

73
0:04:14.299,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing.

74
0:04:16.68,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It was when I put the water in

75
0:04:18.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself.

76
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's an icon of water itself,

77
0:04:22.96,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.

78
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Each bottle is different,

79
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
meaning the water level will give you a different shape.

80
0:04:30.804,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's mass individualism from a single product.

81
0:04:33.84,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It fits the hand.

82
0:04:35.08,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands.

83
0:04:37.44,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It makes the product strong, the tessellation.

84
0:04:39.607,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's a millefiori of ideas.

85
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In the future, they will look like that,

86
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because we need to move away from those type of polymers

87
0:04:47.331,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and use that for medical equipment

88
0:04:48.982,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and more important things, perhaps, in life.

89
0:04:51.062,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials,

90
0:04:53.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
will come into play in probably a decade.

91
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It doesn't look as cool, does it?

92
0:04:57.8,000 --> 0:05:,000
But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that.

93
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I design for that condition, biopolymers. It's the future.

94
0:05:05.76,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I took this video in Cape Town last year.

95
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is the freaky side coming out.

96
0:05:09.96,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.

97
0:05:14.52,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry;

98
0:05:17.48,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I don't know what I think.

99
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But I just know that nature --

100
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:26,000
nature improves with ever-greater purpose

101
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that which once existed,

102
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking.

103
0:05:33.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.

104
0:05:36.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do --

105
0:05:39.925,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that,

106
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?

107
0:05:46.74,000 --> 0:05:47,000
How do you condense that?

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It comes back to instinct.

109
0:05:49.72,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that

110
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that.

111
0:05:55.324,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I'm just interested in natural growth patterns

112
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates.

113
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
How that flows through me and how that comes out

114
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is what I'm trying to understand.

115
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is a scan through the human forearm.

116
0:06:09.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's then blown up through rapid prototyping

117
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to reveal its cellular structure.

118
0:06:13.76,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I have these in my office.

119
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum

120
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and a NASA space lab.

121
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.

122
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is one of my specimens.

123
0:06:24.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is made --

124
0:06:26.2,000 --> 0:06:32,000
bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers.

125
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience,

126
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which was called "domestic science,"

127
0:06:39.499,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.

128
0:06:43.095,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:44.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Actually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked --

130
0:06:47.4,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:48.64,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous.

132
0:06:51.284,000 --> 0:06:53,000
All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand.

133
0:06:53.689,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Anyway -- this is a meringue.

134
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is another sample I have.

135
0:06:56.76,000 --> 0:06:59,000
A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.

136
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It's made from polysaccharides and proteins.

137
0:07:03.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
If you pour water on that, it dissolves.

138
0:07:06.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future?

139
0:07:09.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Not a bad idea. I don't know.

140
0:07:11.52,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that,

141
0:07:14.306,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something,

142
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:19,000
a car -- I don't know.

143
0:07:20.318,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm also interested in growth patterns:

144
0:07:22.2,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the unbridled way that nature grows things

145
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so you're not restricted by form at all.

146
0:07:29.32,000 --> 0:07:32,000
These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do,

147
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
although I might end up making something incredibly simple.

148
0:07:36.48,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.

149
0:07:39.72,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering

150
0:07:44.8,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and biological thinking,

151
0:07:46.809,000 --> 0:07:48,000
shown pretty much as a bone structure.

152
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall

153
0:07:51.76,000 --> 0:07:52,000
as some kind of art object.

154
0:07:53.44,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's the world's first chair made in magnesium.

155
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.

156
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's called "Go," by Bernhardt, USA.

157
0:08:01.32,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.

158
0:08:07.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough.

159
0:08:12.2,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry,

160
0:08:15.2,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and then you break up what you need.

161
0:08:16.939,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working.

162
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's a godly way of working.

163
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's organic and it's essential.

164
0:08:23.72,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's an absolutely fat-free design,

165
0:08:25.411,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and when you look at it, you see human beings.

166
0:08:29.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
When that moves into polymers,

167
0:08:30.773,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form.

168
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.

169
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:4,000
What nature does is it drills holes in things.

170
0:08:41.6,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It liberates form.

171
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It takes away anything extraneous.

172
0:08:44.96,000 --> 0:08:45,000
That's what I do.

173
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I make organic things which are essential.

174
0:08:48.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And they look funky, too -- but I don't set out to make funky things

175
0:08:52.76,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because I think that's an absolute disgrace.

176
0:08:54.84,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I set out to look at natural forms.

177
0:08:56.96,000 --> 0:08:59,000
If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane,

178
0:09:00.96,000 --> 0:09:02,000
shrinking it down constantly like nature does --

179
0:09:03.679,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that could be a seat for a chair.

180
0:09:05.28,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It could be a sole for a sports shoe.

181
0:09:07.08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It could be a car blending into seats.

182
0:09:09.96,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff.

183
0:09:12.64,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is what exists in nature.

184
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Observation now allows us to bring that natural process

185
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:21,000
into the design process every day.

186
0:09:21.48,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That's what I do.

187
0:09:22.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo.

188
0:09:24.8,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's called "Superliquidity." It's my sculptural investigation.

189
0:09:28.48,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's like 21st-century Henry Moore.

190
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up.

191
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
There's some amazing spiritual connect.

192
0:09:37.24,000 --> 0:09:4,000
If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.

193
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.

194
0:09:44.36,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That is the power of organic design.

195
0:09:46.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It contributes immensely to our --

196
0:09:51.72,000 --> 0:09:52,000
sense of being,

197
0:09:53.28,000 --> 0:09:54,000
our sense of relationships with things,

198
0:09:55.162,000 --> 0:09:57,000
our sensuality and, you know, the sort of --

199
0:09:57.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important.

200
0:10:01.4,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This is my artwork. This is all my process.

201
0:10:03.92,000 --> 0:10:07,000
These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints.

202
0:10:07.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But this is how I get to that object.

203
0:10:10.48,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Ironically, that object was made by the Killarney process,

204
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century,

205
0:10:16.32,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that.

206
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I'll tell you about that later.

207
0:10:21.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When I look into these data images,

208
0:10:24.88,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I see new things.

209
0:10:26.64,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's self-inspired.

210
0:10:29.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Diatomic structures, radiolaria,

211
0:10:31.12,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the things that we couldn't see but we can do now --

212
0:10:33.573,000 --> 0:10:34,000
these, again, are cored out.

213
0:10:34.933,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica.

214
0:10:38.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Why not structures from cars like that?

215
0:10:40.56,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Coral, all these natural forces,

216
0:10:43.68,000 --> 0:10:48,000
take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty.

217
0:10:48.88,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We need to be in that realm.

218
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I want to do stuff like that.

219
0:10:53.56,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is a new chair which should come on the market in September.

220
0:10:56.632,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas-injected polymer chair.

221
0:11:00.48,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Those holes you see there are very filtered-down,

222
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures.

223
0:11:07.2,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see --

224
0:11:09.748,000 --> 0:11:11,000
there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing.

225
0:11:12.76,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.

226
0:11:16.68,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If you see the shadows that come through that,

227
0:11:18.855,000 --> 0:11:2,000
they're actually probably more important than the product,

228
0:11:21.601,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but it's the minimum it takes.

229
0:11:23.062,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The coring out of the back lets you breathe.

230
0:11:25.36,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It takes away any material you don't need

231
0:11:27.337,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it actually garners flexure too.

232
0:11:31.32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I was going to break into a dance then.

233
0:11:34.44,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is some current work I'm doing.

234
0:11:36.4,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm looking at single-surface structures

235
0:11:38.48,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and how they stretch and flow.

236
0:11:41.2,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation.

237
0:11:47.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's made from aluminum ...

238
0:11:49.8,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.

239
0:11:53.08,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's grown in my mind,

240
0:11:54.32,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.

241
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on.

242
0:12:03.6,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It's being built as we speak

243
0:12:05.8,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.

244
0:12:08.8,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers.

245
0:12:11.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.

246
0:12:14.68,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is what goes on in my studio everyday.

247
0:12:16.72,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.

248
0:12:18.52,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Some guy's got that on a computer -- there's this like, oh my goodness.

249
0:12:21.878,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.

250
0:12:25.64,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This kind of effervescent --

251
0:12:27.68,000 --> 0:12:32,000
fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.

252
0:12:33.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Single-surface products.

253
0:12:35.28,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Furniture's a good one.

254
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How you grow legs out of a surface.

255
0:12:39.84,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I would love to build this one day

256
0:12:41.484,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar,

257
0:12:44.48,000 --> 0:12:47,000
polymer, wood chips -- I don't know, human hair.

258
0:12:48.12,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time.

259
0:12:51.84,000 --> 0:12:54,000
That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that.

260
0:12:55.68,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.

261
0:12:58.4,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They said, "Give us the dream. What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"

262
0:13:01.821,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I said, "You don't copy Apple, that's for sure.

263
0:13:04.044,000 --> 0:13:05,000
You get into biopolymers."

264
0:13:05.328,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They looked straight through me.

265
0:13:07.92,000 --> 0:13:08,000
What a waste. Anyway.

266
0:13:09.76,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Laughter)

267
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
No, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean --

268
0:13:14.24,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:15.6,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I'm delivering; they're not taking.

270
0:13:17.84,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I've had this image 20 years.

271
0:13:19.4,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.

272
0:13:23.04,000 --> 0:13:24,000
That is an image of a car for me.

273
0:13:24.84,000 --> 0:13:26,000
That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet.

274
0:13:27.245,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I've been banging on about this like I can't believe.

275
0:13:29.84,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Cars are all wrong.

276
0:13:31.08,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm going to show you something a bit weird now.

277
0:13:33.343,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this.

278
0:13:35.96,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow.

279
0:13:38.04,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Cars are made from 30,000 components.

280
0:13:39.88,000 --> 0:13:44,000
How ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300?

281
0:13:45.56,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.

282
0:13:48.72,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin.

283
0:13:52.276,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back

284
0:13:54.783,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1.

285
0:13:58.107,000 --> 0:14:,000
You take them off your wall, you plug them in. Off you go.

286
0:14:00.941,000 --> 0:14:02,000
A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,

287
0:14:03.68,000 --> 0:14:05,000
transparent, so you can see the people in there.

288
0:14:05.943,000 --> 0:14:06,000
You drive different.

289
0:14:07.444,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You see that thing. You do. You do.

290
0:14:09.64,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And not anesthetized, separated from life.

291
0:14:12.36,000 --> 0:14:15,000
There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that.

292
0:14:15.68,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It's a city car. You drive along. You get out.

293
0:14:19.12,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You drive on to a proboscis. You get out.

294
0:14:22.96,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It lifts you up.

295
0:14:24.2,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.

296
0:14:27.74,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

297
0:14:31.92,000 --> 0:14:34,000
That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first,

298
0:14:34.992,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and do the car second.

299
0:14:36.2,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages,

300
0:14:38.84,000 --> 0:14:42,000
floating around on the ground, driven by AI.

301
0:14:43.64,000 --> 0:14:44,000
When I showed this in South Africa,

302
0:14:45.339,000 --> 0:14:48,000
everybody afterwards was going, "Hey, car on a stick. Like this."

303
0:14:48.466,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.

304
0:14:50.15,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Laughter)

305
0:14:51.36,000 --> 0:14:53,000
If you put it next to contemporary architecture,

306
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it feels totally natural to me.

307
0:14:55.56,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And that's what I do with my furniture.

308
0:14:57.442,000 --> 0:15:,000
I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore.

309
0:15:00.6,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture.

310
0:15:03.217,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I'm trying to build transportation systems.

311
0:15:05.248,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I work on aircraft for Airbus,

312
0:15:07.566,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I do all this sort of stuff

313
0:15:08.88,000 --> 0:15:11,000
trying to force these natural, inspired-by-nature dreams home.

314
0:15:12.68,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I'm going to finish on two things.

315
0:15:14.48,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This is the stereolithography of a staircase.

316
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson.

317
0:15:21.92,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I built this thing for my studio.

318
0:15:23.52,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.

319
0:15:26.76,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin.

320
0:15:29.68,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I built this.

321
0:15:30.92,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex.

322
0:15:33.72,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.

323
0:15:37.56,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Lean, efficient things. Healthy products.

324
0:15:42.12,000 --> 0:15:43,000
This is built by composites.

325
0:15:43.56,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element,

326
0:15:48.2,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places.

327
0:15:52.04,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Modern materials allow us to do modern things.

328
0:15:54.96,000 --> 0:15:55,000
This is a shot in the studio.

329
0:15:56.6,000 --> 0:15:58,000
This is how it looks pretty much every day.

330
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it.

331
0:16:01.96,000 --> 0:16:05,000
There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.

332
0:16:06.36,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

333
0:16:08.44,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Who cares?

334
0:16:09.68,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

335
0:16:11.12,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength.

336
0:16:14.002,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.

337
0:16:17.217,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap --

338
0:16:19.56,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the prostitutes and all that stuff.

339
0:16:21.28,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It's next to David Hockney's original studio.

340
0:16:23.44,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day.

341
0:16:26.139,000 --> 0:16:28,000
My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in,

342
0:16:29.028,000 --> 0:16:31,000
because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in.

343
0:16:31.987,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This is my studio.

344
0:16:33.196,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Elephant skull from Oxford University, 1988.

345
0:16:35.44,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find.

346
0:16:38.084,000 --> 0:16:4,000
If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me,

347
0:16:40.68,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I'll put it in the studio.

348
0:16:42.24,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So I'm just going to interject a little bit

349
0:16:44.6,000 --> 0:16:46,000
with some of the things that you'll see in the video.

350
0:16:47.36,000 --> 0:16:5,000
It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning

351
0:16:50.68,000 --> 0:16:52,000
just to show you how my real world is.

352
0:16:53.12,000 --> 0:16:54,000
You never see that.

353
0:16:54.36,000 --> 0:16:57,000
You never see architects or designers showing you their real world.

354
0:16:57.527,000 --> 0:16:58,000
This is called a "Plasnet."

355
0:16:58.84,000 --> 0:17:01,000
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.

356
0:17:02.72,000 --> 0:17:04,000
World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars.

357
0:17:05.72,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We should all be riding one of these.

358
0:17:07.52,000 --> 0:17:11,000
As China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this.

359
0:17:11.64,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Counterbalance.

360
0:17:14.36,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Like I say, it's a cross

361
0:17:15.6,000 --> 0:17:18,000
between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory.

362
0:17:18.84,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It's full of prototypes and objects.

363
0:17:21.04,000 --> 0:17:22,000
It's self-inspirational, again.

364
0:17:22.734,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I mean, the rare times when I'm there,

365
0:17:24.633,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I do enjoy it.

366
0:17:26.24,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And I get lots and lots of kids coming.

367
0:17:30.119,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers.

368
0:17:35.359,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Sorry.

369
0:17:36.599,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Laughter)

370
0:17:38.56,000 --> 0:17:4,000
That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture.

371
0:17:41.4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp --

372
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the first produced.

373
0:17:46.92,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Giles Revell should be talking here today --

374
0:17:49.119,000 --> 0:17:51,000
amazing photography of things you can't see.

375
0:17:51.359,000 --> 0:17:55,000
The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo.

376
0:17:57.68,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair --

377
0:17:59.8,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that golden looking thing is called "Leaf."

378
0:18:01.824,000 --> 0:18:02,000
It's made from Kevlar.

379
0:18:03.4,000 --> 0:18:05,000
On the wall is my book called "Supernatural,"

380
0:18:05.56,000 --> 0:18:07,000
which allows me to remember what I've done, because I forget.

381
0:18:08.442,000 --> 0:18:1,000
There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year,

382
0:18:11.04,000 --> 0:18:13,000
in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.

383
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Gernot Oberfell, working at three o'clock in the morning --

384
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and I don't pay overtime.

385
0:18:22.08,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Overtime is the passion of design,

386
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
so join the club or don't.

387
0:18:27.8,000 --> 0:18:28,000
(Laughter)

388
0:18:29.36,000 --> 0:18:31,000
No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg --

389
0:18:31.384,000 --> 0:18:33,000
we're traveling like you can't -- we fit it all in.

390
0:18:33.789,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I don't know how we do it.

391
0:18:35.6,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden, then I'm in Beijing on Friday.

392
0:18:39.88,000 --> 0:18:4,000
You work that one out.

393
0:18:41.44,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And when I see Ed's photographs, I think, why the hell am I going to China?

394
0:18:45.64,000 --> 0:18:46,000
It's true. It's true.

395
0:18:46.88,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Because there's a soul in this whole thing.

396
0:18:49.04,000 --> 0:18:52,000
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century.

397
0:18:52.56,000 --> 0:18:54,000
We need to combine all this stuff.

398
0:18:54.88,000 --> 0:18:56,000
If all the people who were talking over this period

399
0:18:57.6,000 --> 0:18:58,000
worked on a car together,

400
0:18:58.84,000 --> 0:19:,000
it would be a joy, absolute joy.

401
0:19:03.04,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So there's a new X-light system I'm doing in Japan.

402
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:11,000
There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask.

403
0:19:11.72,000 --> 0:19:12,000
These are my sculptures.

404
0:19:14.24,000 --> 0:19:15,000
A copper jelly mold.

405
0:19:15.96,000 --> 0:19:16,000
(Laughter)

406
0:19:17.72,000 --> 0:19:19,000
It sounds like some quiz show or something, doesn't it?

407
0:19:22.44,000 --> 0:19:23,000
So, it's going to end.

408
0:19:25.76,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Thank you, James, for your great inspiration.

409
0:19:34.36,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Thank you very much.

410
0:19:35.64,000 --> 0:19:37,000
(Applause)

0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
introduced a design challenge

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
called the marshmallow challenge.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And the idea's pretty simple:

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one yard of tape, one yard of string

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and a marshmallow.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The marshmallow has to be on top.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because it forces people

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to collaborate very quickly.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I incorporated it into a design workshop.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it was a huge success.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And since then, I've conducted

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
about 70 design workshops across the world

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with students and designers and architects,

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and there's something about this exercise

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that reveals very deep lessons

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
about the nature of collaboration,

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I'd like to share some of them with you.

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, normally, most people begin

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
by orienting themselves to the task.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they jockey for power.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Then they spend some time planning, organizing,

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They spend the majority of their time

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And then finally, just as they're running out of time,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
someone takes out the marshmallow,

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and then they gingerly put it on top,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they admire their work.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But what really happens, most of the time,

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to buckle and to collapse.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So there are a number of people

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They lie, they cheat, they get distracted

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they produce really lame structures.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And of course there are teams

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And it's pretty amazing.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
As Peter tells us,

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
not only do they produce the tallest structures,

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but they're the most interesting structures of them all.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So the question you want to ask is:

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
How come? Why? What is it about them?

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And Peter likes to say that

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
none of the kids spend any time

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They don't spend time jockeying for power.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But there's another reason as well.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the reason is that business students are trained

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to find the single right plan, right?

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And then they execute on it.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they run out of time and what happens?

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's a crisis.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Sound familiar? Right.

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What kindergarteners do differently

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is that they start with the marshmallow,

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
always keeping the marshmallow on top,

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Designers recognize this type of collaboration

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as the essence of the iterative process.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And with each version, kids get instant feedback

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
about what works and what doesn't work.

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but let's look at how different teams perform.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So the average for most people is around 20 inches;

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
business schools students, about half of that;

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
kindergarteners, better than most adults.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Who does the very best?

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Architects and engineers, thankfully.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And why is it? Because they understand triangles

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are the key to building

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
stable structures.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So CEOs, a little bit better than average,

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but here's where it gets interesting.

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they get significantly better.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because they have special skills

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of facilitation.

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They manage the process, they understand the process.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And any team who manages

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and pays close attention to work

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
will significantly improve the team's performance.

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Specialized skills and facilitation skills

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
are the combination that leads to strong success.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If you have 10 teams that typically perform,

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I tried something interesting.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I thought, let's up the ante, once.

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So what do you think happened to these design students?

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What was the result?

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Here's what happened:

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Not one team had a standing structure.

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they would have taken home the prize.

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
have a strong impact.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We did the exercise again with the same students.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What do you think happened then?

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So now they understand the value of prototyping.

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So the same team went from being the very worst

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to being among the very best.

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So there's deep lessons for us

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about the nature of incentives and success.

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So, you might ask: Why would anyone

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And the reason is, I help create

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
digital tools and processes

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to help teams build cars and video games

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and visual effects.

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And what the marshmallow challenge does

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Because, frankly,

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The challenge provides a shared experience,

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a common language,

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
a common stance to build the right prototype.

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so, this is the value of the experience,

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of this so simple exercise.

143
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And those of you who are interested

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's a blog that you can look at

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
how to build the marshmallows.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There's step-by-step instructions on this.

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
There are crazy examples from around the world

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of how people tweak and adjust the system.

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There's world records that are on this as well.

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And the fundamental lesson, I believe,

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is that design truly is

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
a contact sport.

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and that we apply the very best of our thinking,

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
our feeling and our doing

157
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to the challenge that we have at hand.

158
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience

159
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is all that it takes to turn us

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that can make a big difference.

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Thank you very much.

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Applause)

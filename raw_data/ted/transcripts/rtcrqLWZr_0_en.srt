1
0:00:13.032,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Congratulations.

2
0:00:14.721,000 --> 0:00:15,000
By being here,

3
0:00:15.945,000 --> 0:00:16,000
listening, alive,

4
0:00:17.406,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a member of a growing species,

5
0:00:19.731,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you are one of history's greatest winners --

6
0:00:22.716,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the culmination of a success story four billion years in the making.

7
0:00:27.768,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You are life's one percent.

8
0:00:30.884,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The losers,

9
0:00:32.064,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the 99 percent of species who have ever lived,

10
0:00:34.92,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are dead --

11
0:00:36.11,000 --> 0:00:39,000
killed by fire, flood, asteroids,

12
0:00:39.495,000 --> 0:00:41,000
predation, starvation, ice, heat

13
0:00:41.82,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the cold math of natural selection.

14
0:00:45.186,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Your ancestors,

15
0:00:46.41,000 --> 0:00:47,000
back to the earliest fishes,

16
0:00:47.984,000 --> 0:00:49,000
overcame all these challenges.

17
0:00:50.932,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You are here because of golden opportunities

18
0:00:53.925,000 --> 0:00:55,000
made possible by mass extinction.

19
0:00:57.437,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:01.048,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's true.

21
0:01:02.223,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The same is true of your co-winners and relatives.

22
0:01:05.476,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The 34,000 kinds of fishes.

23
0:01:08.586,000 --> 0:01:1,000
How did we all get so lucky?

24
0:01:10.71,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Will we continue to win?

25
0:01:13.278,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I am a fish paleobiologist who uses big data --

26
0:01:17.257,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the fossil record --

27
0:01:18.49,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to study how some species win and others lose.

28
0:01:22.088,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The living can't tell us;

29
0:01:23.722,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they know nothing but winning.

30
0:01:25.446,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So, we must speak with the dead.

31
0:01:27.946,000 --> 0:01:28,000
How do we make dead fishes talk?

32
0:01:30.265,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Museums contain multitudes of beautiful fish fossils,

33
0:01:34.702,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but their real beauty emerges

34
0:01:36.506,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when combined with the larger number of ugly, broken fossils,

35
0:01:40.777,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and reduced to ones and zeros.

36
0:01:43.327,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I can trawl a 500-million-year database for evolutionary patterns.

37
0:01:48.412,000 --> 0:01:49,000
For example,

38
0:01:49.59,000 --> 0:01:52,000
fish forms can be captured by coordinates

39
0:01:53.361,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and transformed to reveal major pathways of change

40
0:01:57.491,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and trends through time.

41
0:02:00.583,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Here is the story of the winners and losers

42
0:02:02.944,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of just one pivotal event I discovered using fossil data.

43
0:02:07.5,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Let's travel back 360 million years --

44
0:02:11.996,000 --> 0:02:14,000
six times as long ago as the last dinosaur --

45
0:02:15.56,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to the Devonian period;

46
0:02:17.23,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a strange world.

47
0:02:19.505,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Armored predators with razor-edge jaws dominated

48
0:02:23.39,000 --> 0:02:27,000
alongside huge fishes with arm bones in their fins.

49
0:02:29.106,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Crab-like fishes scuttled across the sea floor.

50
0:02:33.278,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The few ray-fin relatives of salmon and tuna

51
0:02:36.785,000 --> 0:02:38,000
cowered at the bottom of the food chain.

52
0:02:40.217,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The few early sharks lived offshore in fear.

53
0:02:44.9,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Your few four-legged ancestors, the tetrapods,

54
0:02:48.676,000 --> 0:02:5,000
struggled in tropical river plains.

55
0:02:52.391,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Ecosystems were crowded.

56
0:02:54.744,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There was no escape,

57
0:02:56.623,000 --> 0:02:57,000
no opportunity in sight.

58
0:02:59.11,000 --> 0:03:,000
Then the world ended.

59
0:03:00.888,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:02.862,000 --> 0:03:03,000
No, it is a good thing.

61
0:03:04.251,000 --> 0:03:08,000
96 percent of all fish species died

62
0:03:08.643,000 --> 0:03:12,000
during the Hangenberg event, 359 million years ago:

63
0:03:13.127,000 --> 0:03:15,000
an interval of fire and ice.

64
0:03:15.516,000 --> 0:03:17,000
A crowded world was disrupted and swept away.

65
0:03:19.735,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now, you might think that's the end of the story.

66
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The mighty fell, the meek inherited the earth,

67
0:03:24.475,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and here we are.

68
0:03:26.66,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But winning is not that simple.

69
0:03:30.168,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The handful of survivors came from many groups --

70
0:03:33.357,000 --> 0:03:35,000
all greatly outnumbered by their own dead.

71
0:03:36.327,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They ranged from top predator to bottom-feeder,

72
0:03:39.084,000 --> 0:03:4,000
big to small,

73
0:03:40.408,000 --> 0:03:41,000
marine to freshwater.

74
0:03:42.405,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The extinction was a filter.

75
0:03:44.421,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It merely leveled the playing field.

76
0:03:47.352,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What really counted was what survivors did over the next several million years

77
0:03:52.794,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in that devastated world.

78
0:03:56.033,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The former overlords should have had an advantage.

79
0:03:59.245,000 --> 0:04:,000
They became even larger,

80
0:04:01.109,000 --> 0:04:02,000
storing energy,

81
0:04:02.527,000 --> 0:04:03,000
investing in their young,

82
0:04:04.174,000 --> 0:04:05,000
spreading across the globe,

83
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
feasting on fishes,

84
0:04:07.353,000 --> 0:04:1,000
keeping what had always worked, and biding their time.

85
0:04:10.906,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Yet they merely persisted for a while,

86
0:04:13.947,000 --> 0:04:15,000
declining without innovating,

87
0:04:16.018,000 --> 0:04:18,000
becoming living fossils.

88
0:04:18.887,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They were too stuck in their ways

89
0:04:20.872,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and are now largely forgotten.

90
0:04:24.366,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A few of the long-suffering ray-fins, sharks and four-legged tetrapods

91
0:04:29.549,000 --> 0:04:3,000
went the opposite direction.

92
0:04:31.528,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They became smaller --

93
0:04:33.264,000 --> 0:04:34,000
living fast, dying young,

94
0:04:35.108,000 --> 0:04:37,000
eating little and reproducing rapidly.

95
0:04:37.687,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They tried new foods,

96
0:04:39.678,000 --> 0:04:4,000
different homes,

97
0:04:40.907,000 --> 0:04:42,000
strange heads and weird bodies.

98
0:04:43.282,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:44.488,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And they found opportunity, proliferated,

100
0:04:47.472,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and won the future for their 60,000 living species,

101
0:04:51.451,000 --> 0:04:52,000
including you.

102
0:04:52.846,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That's why they look familiar.

103
0:04:54.489,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You know their names.

104
0:04:57.635,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Winning is not about random events

105
0:05:00.136,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or an arms race.

106
0:05:01.619,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Rather, survivors went down alternative, evolutionary pathways.

107
0:05:06.294,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Some found incredible success,

108
0:05:08.843,000 --> 0:05:1,000
while others became dead fish walking.

109
0:05:12.572,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:14.909,000 --> 0:05:15,000
A real scientific term.

111
0:05:16.54,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:18.747,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I am now investigating

113
0:05:19.939,000 --> 0:05:22,000
how these pathways to victory and defeat repeat across time.

114
0:05:24.075,000 --> 0:05:28,000
My lab has already compiled thousands upon thousands of dead fishes,

115
0:05:28.221,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but many more remain.

116
0:05:29.893,000 --> 0:05:3,000
However, it is already clear

117
0:05:31.774,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that your ancestors' survival through mass extinction,

118
0:05:35.478,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and their responses in the aftermath

119
0:05:37.946,000 --> 0:05:38,000
made you who you are today.

120
0:05:40.262,000 --> 0:05:42,000
What does this tell us for the future?

121
0:05:42.405,000 --> 0:05:44,000
As long as a handful of species survive,

122
0:05:45.183,000 --> 0:05:47,000
life will recover.

123
0:05:47.281,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The versatile and the lucky will not just replace what was lost,

124
0:05:51.178,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but win in new forms.

125
0:05:53.121,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It just might take several million years.

126
0:05:56.639,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Thank you.

127
0:05:57.813,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and how it can be solved.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'd like to start with a little experiment.

4
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,

5
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or you've had laser refractive surgery?

6
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.

7
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room

8
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population

9
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that have some sort of vision correction.

10
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The World Health Organization estimates --

11
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses --

12
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the lowest estimate is 150 million people.

13
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They also have an estimate of around a billion.

14
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,

15
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear

16
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is around half of any population.

17
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,

18
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it's also an educational problem,

19
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.

20
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.

21
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world

22
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear

23
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that we have in the developed world.

24
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There are just way too few eye care professionals.

25
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist

26
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people

27
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and that's the ratio in the U.K.

28
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.

29
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa

30
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.

31
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?

32
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I came up with a solution to this problem,

33
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.

34
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself

35
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and that solves the problem.

36
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.

37
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.

38
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.

39
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,

40
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I can see that guy running out there.

41
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.

42
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Next step in my process.

43
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.

44
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...

45
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...

46
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
... I've just ...

47
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.

48
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

49
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.

50
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In fact, this technology's been evolving.

51
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I started working on it in 1985,

52
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and it's been evolving very slowly.

53
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There are about 30,000 in use now.

54
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.

55
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.

56
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I have a global vision for vision.

57
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And that vision is to try to get a billion people

58
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.

59
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.

60
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The technology is being further developed --

61
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the cost has to be brought down.

62
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.

63
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But the cost has to be brought right down.

64
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations

65
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who live on a dollar a day.

66
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
How do you solve this problem?

67
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You start to get into detail.

68
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.

69
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?

70
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?

71
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
How do you deal with the industry?

72
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And the answer to that is research.

73
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World

74
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
here in the university.

75
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.

76
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000

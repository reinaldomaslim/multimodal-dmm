1
0:00:11.96,000 --> 0:00:18,000
did you know that one of the first

2
0:00:14.99,000 --> 0:00:21,000
fertility drugs was made from the pee of

3
0:00:19.369,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Catholic nuns and that even the Pope got

4
0:00:22.47,000 --> 0:00:29,000
involved so this is totally true back in

5
0:00:26.31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the 1950s scientists knew that when

6
0:00:30.24,000 --> 0:00:34,000
women enter menopause they start

7
0:00:32.61,000 --> 0:00:36,000
releasing high levels of fertility

8
0:00:34.59,000 --> 0:00:38,000
hormones in their urine but there was

9
0:00:36.93,000 --> 0:00:4,000
this doctor named Bruno Lunan Feld who

10
0:00:39.21,000 --> 0:00:44,000
wondered if he could actually isolate

11
0:00:41.43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
those hormones from the urine and use it

12
0:00:44.219,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to help women who are having trouble

13
0:00:45.66,000 --> 0:00:49,000
getting pregnant obviously the problem

14
0:00:47.7,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with this was that in order to test this

15
0:00:49.77,000 --> 0:00:55,000
idea he needed a lot of pee from older

16
0:00:53.94,000 --> 0:00:58,000
women and that is not an easy thing to

17
0:00:56.399,000 --> 0:01:03,000
find so he and his colleagues got

18
0:00:59.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
special permission from the Pope to

19
0:01:03.539,000 --> 0:01:1,000
collect gallons and gallons of urine

20
0:01:06.689,000 --> 0:01:13,000
from hundreds of older Catholic nuns and

21
0:01:11.31,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in doing so he actually isolated

22
0:01:14.369,000 --> 0:01:18,000
hormones that are still used to help

23
0:01:16.5,000 --> 0:01:21,000
women get pregnant today though now they

24
0:01:18.99,000 --> 0:01:24,000
can be synthesized in a lab and gallons

25
0:01:21.81,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of pee are necessary so why am i

26
0:01:25.89,000 --> 0:01:29,000
standing up here telling this

27
0:01:27.619,000 --> 0:01:34,000
wonderfully intellectual audience about

28
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:36,000
nun pee well I'm a science journalist

29
0:01:34.86,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and multimedia producer who has always

30
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:43,000
been fascinated by gross stuff so

31
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:45,000
fascinated in fact that I started a

32
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:48,000
weekly YouTube series called gross

33
0:01:45.78,000 --> 0:01:51,000
science all about the slimy smelly

34
0:01:49.46,000 --> 0:01:55,000
creepy underbelly of nature medicine and

35
0:01:52.74,000 --> 0:01:56,000
technology now I think most of us would

36
0:01:55.89,000 --> 0:01:58,000
agree that there's something little

37
0:01:57.299,000 --> 0:02:01,000
gross about pee you know it's something

38
0:01:59.759,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that we don't really like to talk about

39
0:02:01.439,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and we keep the act of doing it

40
0:02:03.509,000 --> 0:02:09,000
very private but when Lunan valve peered

41
0:02:07.32,000 --> 0:02:12,000
into the world of pee he discovered

42
0:02:09.75,000 --> 0:02:15,000
something deeply helpful to humanity

43
0:02:12.61,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and after a year and a half of making my

44
0:02:15.88,000 --> 0:02:2,000
show I can tell you that very often when

45
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we explore the growth side of life we

46
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:25,000
find insights that we never would have

47
0:02:23.59,000 --> 0:02:27,000
thought we would find and we even often

48
0:02:25.69,000 --> 0:02:29,000
reveal beauty that we didn't think was

49
0:02:27.73,000 --> 0:02:31,000
there I think it's important for us to

50
0:02:29.89,000 --> 0:02:34,000
talk about gross things for a few

51
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:36,000
reasons so first of all talking about

52
0:02:34.93,000 --> 0:02:39,000
gross stuff is a great tool for

53
0:02:37.15,000 --> 0:02:42,000
education and it's an excellent way to

54
0:02:39.97,000 --> 0:02:43,000
preserve curiosity to explain what I

55
0:02:43.03,000 --> 0:02:48,000
mean why don't I tell you a little bit

56
0:02:44.65,000 --> 0:02:52,000
about what I was like as a child so I

57
0:02:48.61,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was what you might call a gross kid in

58
0:02:53.11,000 --> 0:02:58,000
fact my love of science itself began

59
0:02:56.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when my parents bought me a slime

60
0:02:58.42,000 --> 0:03:04,000
chemistry set and was then only enhanced

61
0:03:02.23,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by doing gross experiments in my sixth

62
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
grade biology class so we did things

63
0:03:07.06,000 --> 0:03:12,000
like we swab surfaces around our

64
0:03:10.09,000 --> 0:03:15,000
classroom and cultured the bacteria we'd

65
0:03:12.13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
collected and we dissected owl pellets

66
0:03:15.25,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which are like these balls of material

67
0:03:18.07,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that are undigested that owls barf up

68
0:03:20.53,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and its really kind of gross and awesome

69
0:03:22.299,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and cool now the fact that I was

70
0:03:25.39,000 --> 0:03:28,000
obsessed with gross stuff as a kid is

71
0:03:26.95,000 --> 0:03:3,000
not so revolutionary you know lots of

72
0:03:29.35,000 --> 0:03:34,000
kids are really into gross things like

73
0:03:31.45,000 --> 0:03:37,000
playing in dirt or collecting needles or

74
0:03:34.56,000 --> 0:03:4,000
eating their boogers and why is that

75
0:03:37.89,000 --> 0:03:42,000
well I think really little kids are like

76
0:03:40.69,000 --> 0:03:45,000
little explorers they just want to

77
0:03:43.239,000 --> 0:03:47,000
experience as much as they can and don't

78
0:03:46.209,000 --> 0:03:5,000
have any idea about like the relative

79
0:03:47.62,000 --> 0:03:52,000
acceptability of touching a ladybug

80
0:03:50.709,000 --> 0:03:55,000
versus a stink bug they just want to

81
0:03:53.59,000 --> 0:03:57,000
understand how everything works and

82
0:03:55.709,000 --> 0:04:,000
experience as much of life as they can

83
0:03:57.91,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and that is pure curiosity but then

84
0:04:01.239,000 --> 0:04:05,000
adults step in and we tell kids not to

85
0:04:03.489,000 --> 0:04:08,000
pick their noses and not to touch the

86
0:04:05.98,000 --> 0:04:09,000
slugs or toads or whatever else they

87
0:04:08.709,000 --> 0:04:12,000
find in the backyard because those

88
0:04:10.03,000 --> 0:04:15,000
things are gross and we do that in part

89
0:04:12.79,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to keep kids safe right like maybe

90
0:04:15.28,000 --> 0:04:2,000
picking your nose spreads germs and

91
0:04:17.41,000 --> 0:04:21,000
maybe touching that toad will give you

92
0:04:20.41,000 --> 0:04:23,000
warts even though I don't actually think

93
0:04:22.18,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that's true you should feel free to

94
0:04:23.62,000 --> 0:04:29,000
touch as many toads as you want

95
0:04:26.34,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so at a certain point when kids get a

96
0:04:30.1,000 --> 0:04:33,000
little bit older there's this way that

97
0:04:31.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
engaging with gross stuff isn't just

98
0:04:33.79,000 --> 0:04:37,000
about curiosity it's also about sort of

99
0:04:35.95,000 --> 0:04:39,000
finding out where the limits are pushing

100
0:04:38.14,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the boundaries of what's okay so you

101
0:04:40.69,000 --> 0:04:44,000
know lots of kids of a certain age will

102
0:04:43.09,000 --> 0:04:46,000
have burping competitions or

103
0:04:45.13,000 --> 0:04:49,000
competitions to see who can make the

104
0:04:46.9,000 --> 0:04:5,000
grossest face and they do that in part

105
0:04:49.57,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because it's a little bit transgressive

106
0:04:51.1,000 --> 0:04:57,000
right but there's another layer to why

107
0:04:54.37,000 --> 0:05:,000
we define stuff as gross as humans we've

108
0:04:57.34,000 --> 0:05:04,000
sort of extended the concept of disgust

109
0:05:01.18,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to morality so the psychologist Paul

110
0:05:04.87,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Rozan would say that many of the things

111
0:05:07.18,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we categorize as gross are things that

112
0:05:10.15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
remind us that we're just animals these

113
0:05:13.48,000 --> 0:05:2,000
are things like bodily fluids and sex

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and physical abnormalities and death and

115
0:05:21.19,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the idea that we're just animals can be

116
0:05:24.22,000 --> 0:05:29,000
really unsettling because it can be this

117
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:31,000
reminder of our own mortality and that

118
0:05:30.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
can leave many of us with this like deep

119
0:05:32.05,000 --> 0:05:36,000
existential angst

120
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so rosin would say that there's this way

121
0:05:36.61,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in which disgust and the avoidance of

122
0:05:39.55,000 --> 0:05:45,000
gross things becomes not just a way to

123
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
protect our bodies it becomes a way to

124
0:05:46.03,000 --> 0:05:51,000
protect our souls I think at a certain

125
0:05:49.51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
point kids really begin to internalize

126
0:05:51.61,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this link between disgusting things and

127
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:06:,000
immorality and I well I don't have any

128
0:05:57.73,000 --> 0:06:02,000
concrete data to back up this next idea

129
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I think that for a lot of us it happens

130
0:06:03.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
around the time we had puberty and you

131
0:06:08.02,000 --> 0:06:15,000
know yeah so during puberty you know our

132
0:06:13.27,000 --> 0:06:18,000
bodies are changing and we're sweating

133
0:06:15.76,000 --> 0:06:19,000
more and girls get their periods and

134
0:06:18.55,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we're thinking about sex in this way

135
0:06:19.93,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we never did before and through the

136
0:06:22.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
human capacity for abstraction this

137
0:06:25.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
shame can settle in so we don't

138
0:06:27.88,000 --> 0:06:3,000
necessarily just think oh my goodness

139
0:06:30.28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
something really gross is happening to

140
0:06:31.69,000 --> 0:06:37,000
my body we think oh my god maybe I'm

141
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
gross and maybe that means that there's

142
0:06:38.29,000 --> 0:06:41,000
some

143
0:06:38.639,000 --> 0:06:44,000
bad or wrong about me the thing is that

144
0:06:42.21,000 --> 0:06:47,000
if you de facto associate gross stuff

145
0:06:44.939,000 --> 0:06:49,000
with immorality you lose a huge part of

146
0:06:47.939,000 --> 0:06:51,000
your curiosity because there is so much

147
0:06:50.879,000 --> 0:06:54,000
out there in the world that is a little

148
0:06:52.83,000 --> 0:06:56,000
bit gross like think about going for a

149
0:06:55.08,000 --> 0:06:59,000
walk in the woods you could just pay

150
0:06:57.389,000 --> 0:07:01,000
attention to the birds and the trees and

151
0:06:59.46,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the flowers and that would be fine but

152
0:07:01.86,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in my view you'd be missing a bigger and

153
0:07:05.039,000 --> 0:07:09,000
more awesome picture of life on this

154
0:07:07.53,000 --> 0:07:11,000
planet so there are cycles of decay that

155
0:07:09.75,000 --> 0:07:13,000
are driving forest growth and there are

156
0:07:11.969,000 --> 0:07:15,000
networks of fungus beneath your feet

157
0:07:14.219,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that are connecting literally all of the

158
0:07:16.56,000 --> 0:07:2,000
plants around you like that's really

159
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
amazing so I feel like we should be

160
0:07:20.759,000 --> 0:07:24,000
talking about grow stuff early and often

161
0:07:23.039,000 --> 0:07:26,000
with young people so they feel like

162
0:07:24.99,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they're actually allowed to claim this

163
0:07:26.879,000 --> 0:07:32,000
bigger picture of life on on our planet

164
0:07:30.02,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the good news is that for many of us the

165
0:07:33.18,000 --> 0:07:37,000
fascination with gross stuff doesn't

166
0:07:34.77,000 --> 0:07:39,000
exactly go away we just kind of pretend

167
0:07:37.379,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like it's not there but truthfully we

168
0:07:39.93,000 --> 0:07:45,000
all spend like sort of a big part of our

169
0:07:42.36,000 --> 0:07:47,000
lives just trying not to be gross when

170
0:07:46.08,000 --> 0:07:52,000
you really think about it we're sort of

171
0:07:47.879,000 --> 0:07:53,000
just like bags of fluids and some weird

172
0:07:52.259,000 --> 0:07:58,000
tissues like surrounded by a thin layer

173
0:07:54.81,000 --> 0:08:,000
of skin and to a certain extent multiple

174
0:07:59.25,000 --> 0:08:03,000
times a day whether consciously or

175
0:08:00.99,000 --> 0:08:07,000
subconsciously I need to remind myself

176
0:08:03.75,000 --> 0:08:09,000
not to fart publicly you know

177
0:08:08.189,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so we're desperately trying to avoid

178
0:08:10.199,000 --> 0:08:13,000
being gross all the time so you think

179
0:08:12.15,000 --> 0:08:15,000
many of us take this kind of voyeuristic

180
0:08:13.949,000 --> 0:08:17,000
delight in learning about gross things

181
0:08:15.75,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and this is certainly true of kids and

182
0:08:18.629,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the number of middle school teachers who

183
0:08:20.219,000 --> 0:08:23,000
show my videos in their science classes

184
0:08:21.87,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is like a testament to that but I think

185
0:08:23.849,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it's totally true of adults too

186
0:08:26.009,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you know I think we all love hearing

187
0:08:28.71,000 --> 0:08:32,000
about gross stories because it's a

188
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:36,000
socially acceptable way to explore the

189
0:08:33.3,000 --> 0:08:37,000
growth side of ourselves but there's

190
0:08:36.63,000 --> 0:08:39,000
this other reason that I think talking

191
0:08:37.919,000 --> 0:08:42,000
about gross stuff is so important so um

192
0:08:40.289,000 --> 0:08:46,000
a while back I need a video on tonsil

193
0:08:43.56,000 --> 0:08:49,000
stones sorry everyone which are these

194
0:08:46.829,000 --> 0:08:51,000
balls of mucus and bacteria and food

195
0:08:50.22,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that get lodged in your tonsil

196
0:08:51.83,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and they smell really terrible sometimes

197
0:08:53.96,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you cough them up and it's like it's

198
0:08:56.03,000 --> 0:09:03,000
awful and many many people have

199
0:08:59.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
experienced this but many of the people

200
0:09:03.35,000 --> 0:09:06,000
who've experienced this haven't really

201
0:09:04.67,000 --> 0:09:08,000
had a forum to talk about it and to date

202
0:09:06.59,000 --> 0:09:14,000
this video that I made is my most

203
0:09:09.56,000 --> 0:09:17,000
popular video it has millions of you and

204
0:09:15.34,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in the comments section for that video

205
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:2,000
became sort of like a self-help section

206
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where people could talk about their

207
0:09:21.92,000 --> 0:09:25,000
tonsil stone experiences and like tips

208
0:09:23.75,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and tricks are getting rid of them and I

209
0:09:26.18,000 --> 0:09:28,000
think it just became this great way for

210
0:09:27.5,000 --> 0:09:29,000
people to talk about something that

211
0:09:28.91,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they'd never felt comfortable talking

212
0:09:30.17,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about publicly and that is wonderful

213
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:38,000
when it's about something as goofy as

214
0:09:36.79,000 --> 0:09:4,000
tonsil stones but it's a little sad when

215
0:09:39.17,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a video can have an effect like that

216
0:09:41.09,000 --> 0:09:47,000
when it's about something as common as

217
0:09:43.93,000 --> 0:09:5,000
periods so last February I released a

218
0:09:47.78,000 --> 0:09:52,000
video on menstruation and to this day I

219
0:09:51.02,000 --> 0:09:56,000
am still getting messages from people

220
0:09:53.36,000 --> 0:09:59,000
around the globe who are asking me about

221
0:09:56.27,000 --> 0:10:02,000
their periods there are a lot of young

222
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
people and some not so young people out

223
0:10:03.2,000 --> 0:10:06,000
there who are worried that what's

224
0:10:05.06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
happening to their bodies is somehow not

225
0:10:07.13,000 --> 0:10:1,000
normal and of course I always tell them

226
0:10:09.35,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that I am NOT a medical professional and

227
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that if possible they should talk to a

228
0:10:13.37,000 --> 0:10:16,000
doctor but the truth of the matter is

229
0:10:15.89,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that everyone should feel comfortable

230
0:10:17.21,000 --> 0:10:2,000
talking to a doctor about their own

231
0:10:18.89,000 --> 0:10:21,000
bodies and that's why I think it's

232
0:10:20.63,000 --> 0:10:23,000
really important for us to start this

233
0:10:22.31,000 --> 0:10:26,000
dialogue about gross stuff from a pretty

234
0:10:24.62,000 --> 0:10:28,000
early age so we can let our kids know

235
0:10:27.14,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that it's all right to have agency over

236
0:10:29.39,000 --> 0:10:33,000
your own body and over your own health

237
0:10:31.39,000 --> 0:10:35,000
there's another reason that talking to

238
0:10:33.44,000 --> 0:10:37,000
your doctor about your health and gross

239
0:10:35.54,000 --> 0:10:39,000
stuff is really really important doctors

240
0:10:38.15,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and the scientific community can only

241
0:10:40.22,000 --> 0:10:45,000
address issues when they know there's

242
0:10:42.71,000 --> 0:10:45,000
something to address so one of the

243
0:10:45.44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
really interesting things I learned

244
0:10:46.52,000 --> 0:10:5,000
while making the video on periods that I

245
0:10:49.22,000 --> 0:10:53,000
was talking to this one scientist who

246
0:10:50.75,000 --> 0:10:55,000
told me there's actually still a lot we

247
0:10:53.6,000 --> 0:10:57,000
don't know about about periods like

248
0:10:56.48,000 --> 0:11:,000
there's a lot of basic research that

249
0:10:57.77,000 --> 0:11:01,000
still hasn't been done and in part

250
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that's just because there weren't a lot

251
0:11:02.15,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of scientists in the field who were

252
0:11:05.13,000 --> 0:11:09,000
women to ask questions about it and it's

253
0:11:07.71,000 --> 0:11:12,000
also not a topic that women talk about

254
0:11:09.87,000 --> 0:11:13,000
publicly so there's this gap in what we

255
0:11:12.75,000 --> 0:11:17,000
know just because no one was there to

256
0:11:14.85,000 --> 0:11:18,000
ask a question there's one final reason

257
0:11:17.85,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that I think talking about gross Jeff is

258
0:11:19.83,000 --> 0:11:24,000
so important and that's because you just

259
0:11:23.28,000 --> 0:11:27,000
never know what you're gonna find when

260
0:11:24.99,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you peel back all those layers of

261
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
disgustingness

262
0:11:28.38,000 --> 0:11:35,000
so take the California brown sea hair

263
0:11:32.42,000 --> 0:11:37,000
this is a sea slug that squirts this

264
0:11:35.4,000 --> 0:11:39,000
lovely bright purple ink at any creature

265
0:11:37.77,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that tries to eat it but it also happens

266
0:11:40.38,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to be one of the kinkiest creatures in

267
0:11:43.29,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the animal kingdom so these guys are

268
0:11:46.08,000 --> 0:11:5,000
hermaphrodites which means they have

269
0:11:48.12,000 --> 0:11:53,000
both male and female genitalia and when

270
0:11:50.49,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it's time to mate up to 20 individuals

271
0:11:53.73,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we'll all get together in this kind of

272
0:11:55.41,000 --> 0:12:04,000
like conga line and they'll all mate

273
0:11:58.5,000 --> 0:12:06,000
together a single fear will inseminate

274
0:12:05.1,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the partner in front of it and receive

275
0:12:07.02,000 --> 0:12:16,000
sperm from the one behind which is sort

276
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of like an awesome time saver but if

277
0:12:16.77,000 --> 0:12:19,000
scientists had only like saw this and

278
0:12:18.99,000 --> 0:12:21,000
they were like okay we're just not going

279
0:12:20.7,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to touch that with a stick they would

280
0:12:22.98,000 --> 0:12:25,000
have missed the bigger thing about sea

281
0:12:25.35,000 --> 0:12:29,000
hares that makes them really remarkable

282
0:12:26.85,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so it turns out that these sea hares

283
0:12:30.3,000 --> 0:12:35,000
have a small number of very large

284
0:12:32.61,000 --> 0:12:38,000
neurons which makes them excellent to

285
0:12:35.85,000 --> 0:12:41,000
use in neuroscience research and in fact

286
0:12:38.85,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the scientist Eric Kandel used them in

287
0:12:41.88,000 --> 0:12:47,000
his research to understand how memories

288
0:12:44.55,000 --> 0:12:5,000
are stored and you know what he won a

289
0:12:48.03,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Nobel Prize for his work so go out there

290
0:12:51.45,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and pick up beetles and play in dirt and

291
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
ask questions and own your fascination

292
0:12:57.75,000 --> 0:13:,000
with gross stuff and don't be ashamed of

293
0:12:59.82,000 --> 0:13:03,000
it because you never know what you're

294
0:13:01.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
gonna find and as I say at the end of

295
0:13:04.02,000 --> 0:13:12,000
all my videos you know thank you

296
0:13:09.14,000 --> 0:13:12,000
[Applause]

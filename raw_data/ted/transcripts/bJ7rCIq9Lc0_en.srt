Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.578,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Look, I had second thoughts, really,

3
0:00:14.601,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about whether I could talk about this

4
0:00:16.636,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.

5
0:00:19.676,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,

6
0:00:22.266,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which goes,

7
0:00:23.905,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"The truth will set you free,

8
0:00:25.836,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but first it will piss you off." (Laughter)

9
0:00:29.795,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So -- (Laughter)

10
0:00:32.063,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So with that in mind, I'm going to set about

11
0:00:34.187,000 --> 0:00:35,000
trying to do those things here,

12
0:00:35.778,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and talk about dying in the 21st century.

13
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,

14
0:00:40.04,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die

15
0:00:42.659,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the 21st century.

16
0:00:43.733,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There will be no exceptions to that.

17
0:00:46.123,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There are, apparently, about one in eight of you

18
0:00:48.78,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --

19
0:00:51.304,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:53.482,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.

21
0:00:58.095,000 --> 0:00:59,000
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,

22
0:00:59.748,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a hundred million of my cells will die,

23
0:01:03.244,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells

24
0:01:05.838,000 --> 0:01:07,000
will die and never come back,

25
0:01:07.979,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so you could argue that the dying process

26
0:01:10.06,000 --> 0:01:12,000
starts pretty early in the piece.

27
0:01:12.138,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the

28
0:01:14.252,000 --> 0:01:16,000
21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,

29
0:01:16.617,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck

30
0:01:19.233,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for most of us,

31
0:01:21.578,000 --> 0:01:23,000
unless we do something to try and reclaim this process

32
0:01:24.547,000 --> 0:01:27,000
from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.

33
0:01:28.264,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So there you go. That's the truth.

34
0:01:30.072,000 --> 0:01:31,000
No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see

35
0:01:31.503,000 --> 0:01:33,000
whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.

36
0:01:34.479,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,

37
0:01:37.062,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday

38
0:01:40.166,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.

39
0:01:42.173,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This has been fantastic.

40
0:01:43.373,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We have machines that go ping.

41
0:01:44.528,000 --> 0:01:46,000
There's many of them up there.

42
0:01:46.838,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And we have some wizard technology which I think

43
0:01:49.582,000 --> 0:01:51,000
has worked really well, and over the course of the time

44
0:01:52.094,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I've worked in intensive care, the death rate

45
0:01:54.166,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for males in Australia has halved,

46
0:01:56.536,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and intensive care has had something to do with that.

47
0:01:58.155,000 --> 0:02:,000
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use

48
0:02:00.163,000 --> 0:02:02,000
have got something to do with that.

49
0:02:02.383,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of

50
0:02:04.887,000 --> 0:02:06,000
got caught up in our own success quite a bit,

51
0:02:07.241,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and we started using expressions like "lifesaving."

52
0:02:10.865,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,

53
0:02:12.999,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because obviously, we don't.

54
0:02:14.229,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What we do is prolong people's lives,

55
0:02:16.757,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and delay death,

56
0:02:18.858,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,

57
0:02:21.703,000 --> 0:02:23,000
save lives on any sort of permanent basis.

58
0:02:24.558,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And what's really happened over the period of time

59
0:02:26.543,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that I've been working in intensive care is that

60
0:02:29.182,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,

61
0:02:32.752,000 --> 0:02:36,000
'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century

62
0:02:37.23,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of diseases that we no longer have the answers to

63
0:02:40.83,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in quite the way we did then.

64
0:02:43.34,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift

65
0:02:45.215,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in the way that people die,

66
0:02:47.022,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable

67
0:02:49.293,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to what we can do as what it used to be like

68
0:02:52.119,000 --> 0:02:55,000
when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.

69
0:02:56.03,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,

70
0:02:58.894,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and we haven't really squared with you guys about

71
0:03:01.927,000 --> 0:03:05,000
what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.

72
0:03:05.982,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s

73
0:03:09.373,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when I met this guy.

74
0:03:11.467,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.

75
0:03:15.824,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I was called down to the ward to see him.

76
0:03:18.127,000 --> 0:03:2,000
His is the little hand.

77
0:03:20.372,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was called down to the ward to see him

78
0:03:21.758,000 --> 0:03:22,000
by a respiratory physician.

79
0:03:22.852,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.

80
0:03:25.028,000 --> 0:03:26,000
He's got pneumonia,

81
0:03:26.628,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and he looks like he needs intensive care.

82
0:03:29.133,000 --> 0:03:31,000
His daughter's here and she wants everything possible

83
0:03:31.207,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to be done."

84
0:03:33.738,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Which is a familiar phrase to us.

85
0:03:36.357,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So I go down to the ward and see Jim,

86
0:03:38.188,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and his skin his translucent like this.

87
0:03:39.873,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You can see his bones through the skin.

88
0:03:42.123,000 --> 0:03:43,000
He's very, very thin,

89
0:03:43.661,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,

90
0:03:47.043,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and he's too sick to talk to me,

91
0:03:48.524,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,

92
0:03:53.674,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"Did you and Jim ever talk about

93
0:03:56.638,000 --> 0:03:57,000
what you would want done

94
0:03:58.321,000 --> 0:04:,000
if he ended up in this kind of situation?"

95
0:04:00.335,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"

96
0:04:04.064,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady."

97
0:04:09.124,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,

98
0:04:11.968,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"You know, we always thought there'd be time."

99
0:04:14.971,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Jim was 94. (Laughter)

100
0:04:18.737,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And I realized that something wasn't happening here.

101
0:04:21.271,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There wasn't this dialogue going on

102
0:04:22.595,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that I imagined was happening.

103
0:04:25.248,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So a group of us started doing survey work,

104
0:04:28.255,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home

105
0:04:30.475,000 --> 0:04:33,000
residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,

106
0:04:33.815,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and discovered that only one in a hundred of them

107
0:04:36.762,000 --> 0:04:39,000
had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.

108
0:04:39.827,000 --> 0:04:4,000
One in a hundred.

109
0:04:40.966,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do

110
0:04:44.307,000 --> 0:04:47,000
if they became seriously ill.

111
0:04:47.404,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I realized, of course, this dialogue

112
0:04:50.164,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is definitely not occurring in the public at large.

113
0:04:54.8,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now, I work in acute care.

114
0:04:56.278,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This is John Hunter Hospital.

115
0:04:58.383,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I thought, surely, we do better than that.

116
0:05:02.384,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I

117
0:05:05.38,000 --> 0:05:07,000
went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes

118
0:05:07.896,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in the medical records department

119
0:05:09.169,000 --> 0:05:11,000
looking at whether there was any sign at all

120
0:05:11.79,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that anybody had had any conversation about

121
0:05:14.218,000 --> 0:05:15,000
what might happen to them if the treatment they were

122
0:05:16.071,000 --> 0:05:19,000
receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.

123
0:05:19.415,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And we didn't find a single record of any preference

124
0:05:22.356,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about goals, treatments or outcomes from any

125
0:05:26.2,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.

126
0:05:30.77,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So we started to realize

127
0:05:33.487,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that we had a problem,

128
0:05:35.688,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the problem is more serious because of this.

129
0:05:40.711,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,

130
0:05:44.013,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but how we die is actually really important,

131
0:05:46.678,000 --> 0:05:49,000
obviously not just to us, but also to how that

132
0:05:50.233,000 --> 0:05:53,000
features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.

133
0:05:53.367,000 --> 0:05:55,000
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody

134
0:05:55.688,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who survives us, and

135
0:05:58.805,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the stress created in families by dying is enormous,

136
0:06:02.537,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying

137
0:06:05.223,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,

138
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so dying in intensive care is not your top option

139
0:06:11.038,000 --> 0:06:13,000
if you've got a choice.

140
0:06:13.496,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,

141
0:06:15.665,000 --> 0:06:17,000
all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that

142
0:06:18.313,000 --> 0:06:2,000
many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,

143
0:06:20.665,000 --> 0:06:21,000
will die in intensive care.

144
0:06:22.115,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In the U.S., it's one in five.

145
0:06:23.449,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.

146
0:06:27.199,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So this is the sort of momentum

147
0:06:29.264,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that we've got at the moment.

148
0:06:31.552,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The reason why this is all happening is due to this,

149
0:06:34.097,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I do have to take you through what this is about.

150
0:06:35.399,000 --> 0:06:36,000
These are the four ways to go.

151
0:06:37.364,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So one of these will happen to all of us.

152
0:06:40.229,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The ones you may know most about are the ones

153
0:06:42.759,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:

154
0:06:45.605,000 --> 0:06:46,000
sudden death.

155
0:06:47.022,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It's quite likely in an audience this size

156
0:06:48.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
this won't happen to anybody here.

157
0:06:51.018,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Sudden death has become very rare.

158
0:06:52.748,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff

159
0:06:55.203,000 --> 0:06:56,000
just doesn't happen anymore.

160
0:06:56.876,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The dying process of those with terminal illness

161
0:06:59.293,000 --> 0:07:,000
that we've just seen

162
0:07:00.325,000 --> 0:07:01,000
occurs to younger people.

163
0:07:01.94,000 --> 0:07:03,000
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.

164
0:07:04.79,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.

165
0:07:08.205,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The big growth industry are these.

166
0:07:13.04,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What you die of is increasing organ failure,

167
0:07:16.291,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,

168
0:07:18.526,000 --> 0:07:19,000
whatever organs packing up. Each of these

169
0:07:20.306,000 --> 0:07:22,000
would be an admission to an acute care hospital,

170
0:07:22.909,000 --> 0:07:23,000
at the end of which, or at some point during which,

171
0:07:24.878,000 --> 0:07:26,000
somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.

172
0:07:27.054,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,

173
0:07:29.622,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room

174
0:07:32.197,000 --> 0:07:34,000
will die in this form, which is

175
0:07:34.759,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the dwindling of capacity

176
0:07:38.653,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with increasing frailty,

177
0:07:40.972,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,

178
0:07:43.222,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing

179
0:07:45.775,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that people die of now,

180
0:07:46.824,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the last few years, or the last year of your life

181
0:07:48.952,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.

182
0:07:52.967,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)

183
0:07:56.351,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:59.504,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.

185
0:08:02.932,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:08.09,000 --> 0:08:09,000
What can I say that's positive? What's positive is

187
0:08:09.149,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that this is happening at very great age, now.

188
0:08:11.564,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.

189
0:08:14.309,000 --> 0:08:15,000
You know, historically, we didn't do that.

190
0:08:16.197,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This is what happens to you

191
0:08:17.666,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when you live to be a great age,

192
0:08:20.189,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean

193
0:08:22.078,000 --> 0:08:23,000
more old age, not more youth.

194
0:08:24.005,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)

195
0:08:30.098,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What we did, anyway, look, what we did,

196
0:08:31.895,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we didn't just take this lying down

197
0:08:33.422,000 --> 0:08:34,000
at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.

198
0:08:34.924,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We've started a whole series of projects

199
0:08:36.546,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve

200
0:08:39.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
people much more in the way that things happen to them.

201
0:08:43.036,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing

202
0:08:44.268,000 --> 0:08:46,000
with cultural issues,

203
0:08:46.612,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and this is, I love this Klimt painting,

204
0:08:48.471,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get

205
0:08:50.676,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the whole issue that's going on here,

206
0:08:52.695,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is clearly the separation of death from the living,

207
0:08:56.213,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the fear — Like, if you actually look,

208
0:08:58.093,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there's one woman there

209
0:08:59.268,000 --> 0:09:,000
who has her eyes open.

210
0:09:01.187,000 --> 0:09:02,000
She's the one he's looking at,

211
0:09:02.872,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?

212
0:09:06.1,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She looks terrified.

213
0:09:07.626,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's an amazing picture.

214
0:09:09.319,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.

215
0:09:11.54,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,

216
0:09:13.524,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or, we thought that.

217
0:09:15.019,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government

218
0:09:16.966,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing

219
0:09:18.386,000 --> 0:09:2,000
at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.

220
0:09:21.284,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards

221
0:09:24.133,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and talk to people about the fact that they would die,

222
0:09:27.276,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and what would they prefer under those circumstances.

223
0:09:29.562,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.

224
0:09:33.081,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought

225
0:09:35.541,000 --> 0:09:36,000
this just should have been normal practice,

226
0:09:36.995,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and that this is how things should work.

227
0:09:39.378,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And when they expressed wishes,

228
0:09:41.316,000 --> 0:09:42,000
all of those wishes came true, as it were.

229
0:09:43.289,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We were able to make that happen for them.

230
0:09:45.269,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But then, when the funding ran out,

231
0:09:47.519,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we went back to look six months later,

232
0:09:49.604,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and everybody had stopped again,

233
0:09:51.871,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and nobody was having these conversations anymore.

234
0:09:55.064,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,

235
0:09:57.117,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because we thought this was going to really take off.

236
0:09:59.834,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The cultural issue had reasserted itself.

237
0:10:03.805,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So here's the pitch:

238
0:10:04.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway

239
0:10:09.046,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not

240
0:10:11.545,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that's where we all want to end up,

241
0:10:13.338,000 --> 0:10:15,000
particularly as we become older and increasingly frail

242
0:10:15.474,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.

243
0:10:19.128,000 --> 0:10:21,000
There has to be a little side road

244
0:10:21.458,000 --> 0:10:25,000
off there for people who don't want to go on that track.

245
0:10:25.933,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And I have one small idea,

246
0:10:28.569,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and one big idea about what could happen.

247
0:10:33.018,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And this is the small idea.

248
0:10:34.079,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The small idea is, let's all of us

249
0:10:36.86,000 --> 0:10:39,000
engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.

250
0:10:40.796,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations

251
0:10:42.849,000 --> 0:10:43,000
with our own elders

252
0:10:44.17,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and people who might be approaching this?

253
0:10:46.96,000 --> 0:10:47,000
There are a couple of things you can do.

254
0:10:48.794,000 --> 0:10:5,000
One of them is, you can,

255
0:10:50.925,000 --> 0:10:52,000
just ask this simple question. This question never fails.

256
0:10:53.839,000 --> 0:10:56,000
"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,

257
0:10:57.594,000 --> 0:10:59,000
who would you like to speak for you?"

258
0:11:00.527,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That's a really important question to ask people,

259
0:11:02.441,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because giving people the control over who that is

260
0:11:04.464,000 --> 0:11:07,000
produces an amazing outcome.

261
0:11:07.772,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The second thing you can say is,

262
0:11:08.918,000 --> 0:11:09,000
"Have you spoken to that person

263
0:11:10.416,000 --> 0:11:11,000
about the things that are important to you

264
0:11:12.336,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"

265
0:11:16.49,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So that's the little idea.

266
0:11:19.012,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The big idea, I think, is more political.

267
0:11:20.506,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I think we have to get onto this.

268
0:11:22.457,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I suggested we should have Occupy Death.

269
0:11:25.519,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:28.304,000 --> 0:11:3,000
My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.

271
0:11:30.874,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)

272
0:11:33.453,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So that one didn't really run,

273
0:11:35.318,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but I was very struck by this.

274
0:11:36.988,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, I'm an aging hippie.

275
0:11:38.701,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but

276
0:11:41.198,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s

277
0:11:43.698,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers

278
0:11:47.166,000 --> 0:11:49,000
are used to taking charge of the situation,

279
0:11:49.862,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so if you just replace all these words of birth,

280
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.

281
0:11:56.341,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I do think we have to get political

282
0:11:57.857,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and start to reclaim this process from

283
0:12:00.455,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the medicalized model in which it's going.

284
0:12:02.422,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.

285
0:12:04.462,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,

286
0:12:06.654,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.

287
0:12:09.318,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I don't think euthanasia matters.

288
0:12:11.505,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I actually think that,

289
0:12:13.656,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in places like Oregon,

290
0:12:16.205,000 --> 0:12:19,000
where you can have physician-assisted suicide,

291
0:12:19.677,000 --> 0:12:21,000
you take a poisonous dose of stuff,

292
0:12:21.894,000 --> 0:12:22,000
only half a percent of people ever do that.

293
0:12:23.77,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent

294
0:12:26.476,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of people who don't want to do that.

295
0:12:28.232,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I think most people don't want to be dead,

296
0:12:30.566,000 --> 0:12:32,000
but I do think most people want to have some control

297
0:12:32.663,000 --> 0:12:34,000
over how their dying process proceeds.

298
0:12:35.405,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,

299
0:12:36.545,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but I do think we have to give people back some control.

300
0:12:39.198,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.

301
0:12:42.671,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I think we should be looking at stopping

302
0:12:44.023,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the want for euthanasia,

303
0:12:45.062,000 --> 0:12:49,000
not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.

304
0:12:49.757,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,

305
0:12:53.333,000 --> 0:12:54,000
whom I met when I was a medical student.

306
0:12:54.702,000 --> 0:12:56,000
She founded the hospice movement.

307
0:12:57.581,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And she said, "You matter because you are,

308
0:12:59.772,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and you matter to the last moment of your life."

309
0:13:02.294,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And I firmly believe that

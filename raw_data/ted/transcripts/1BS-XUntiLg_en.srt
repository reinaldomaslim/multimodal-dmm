1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Trees epitomize stasis.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for many human generations,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but if we shift our perspective

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
from the trunk to the twigs,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
trees become very dynamic entities,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
moving and growing.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I decided to explore this movement

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
by turning trees into artists.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and that produced art.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The piece of art you see on your left

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is painted by a western red cedar

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that on your right by a Douglas fir,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and what I learned was that different species

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But I was also interested in the movement of trees

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I simply measured and summed

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
each of those lines.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and the number of branches per tree

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And so I was able to calculate

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
how far a single tree moved in a single year.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You might have a guess.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The answer is actually 186,540 miles,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or seven times around the globe.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to the many dynamic twigs,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but rather extremely dynamic.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I began to think about ways that

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we might consider this lesson of trees,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but which cry for change and dynamicism,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and one of those entities is our prisons.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
are stuck, confined behind bars.

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And our prison system itself is stuck.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The United States has over 2.3 million

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
incarcerated men and women.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That number is rising.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
60 will return to prison.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Funds for education, for training

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and for rehabilitation are declining,

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I decided to ask whether the lesson

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I had learned from trees as artists

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
could be applied to a static institution

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
such as our prisons,

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I think the answer is yes.

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In the year 2007,

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I started a partnership

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with the Washington State Department of Corrections.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
sustainability and conservation projects

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to four state prisons.

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We give science lectures,

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
instead of watching television or weightlifting.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That, I think, is movement.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to grow endangered prairie plants

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That, I think, is movement.

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for later release into protected wetlands.

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That, I think, is movement.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And just recently, we've begun to work with

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
those men who are segregated

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in what we call Supermax facilities.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They've incurred violent infractions

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
by becoming violent with guards

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and with other prisoners.

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They're kept in bare cells like this

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for 23 hours a day.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they're placed in immobile booths like this.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
For one hour a day

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and frogs into these environments,

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we are bringing images of nature

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
into these exercise yards,

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
with visual images of nature.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and he's providing input on the types of images

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
more serene, more calm,

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
less apt to violence.

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so what we see, I think,

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is that small, collective movements of change

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
can perhaps move

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
an entity such as our own prison system

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in a direction of hope.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We know that trees are static entities

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when we look at their trunks.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But if trees can create art,

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
then perhaps there are other static entities

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that we hold inside ourselves,

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like grief, like addictions,

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
like racism,

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that can also change.

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thank you very much.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Applause)

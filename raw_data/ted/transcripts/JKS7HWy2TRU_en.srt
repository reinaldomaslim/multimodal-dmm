1
0:00:12.977,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a storyteller,

2
0:00:14.715,000 --> 0:00:16,000
but I'm also a troublemaker.

3
0:00:16.924,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:17.996,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I have a habit of asking difficult questions.

5
0:00:21.51,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It started when I was 10 years old,

6
0:00:23.872,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and my mother, who was raising six children, had no time for them.

7
0:00:28.691,000 --> 0:00:32,000
At 14, fed up with my increasingly annoying questions,

8
0:00:33.499,000 --> 0:00:37,000
she recommended that I begin writing for the local English-language newspaper

9
0:00:38.05,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in Pakistan,

10
0:00:40.111,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to put my questions out to the entire country, she said.

11
0:00:43.508,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:46.384,000 --> 0:00:49,000
At 17, I was an undercover investigative journalist.

13
0:00:50.413,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I don't even think my editor knew just how young I was

14
0:00:54.398,000 --> 0:00:58,000
when I sent in a story that named and shamed

15
0:00:58.532,000 --> 0:01:,000
some very powerful people.

16
0:01:02.204,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The men I'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson.

17
0:01:06.226,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They wanted to shame me and my family.

18
0:01:11.507,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They spray-painted my name and my family's name

19
0:01:14.49,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with unspeakable profanities across our front gate

20
0:01:18.044,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and around our neighborhood.

21
0:01:19.86,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And they felt that my father, who was a strict man of tradition,

22
0:01:24.49,000 --> 0:01:25,000
would stop me.

23
0:01:26.168,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Instead, my father stood in front of me and said,

24
0:01:29.342,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"If you speak the truth, I will stand with you,

25
0:01:32.043,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and so will the world."

26
0:01:33.494,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then he got --

27
0:01:34.694,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:39.781,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And then he got a group of people together and they whitewashed the walls.

29
0:01:43.574,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:44.818,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I've always wanted my stories to jolt people,

31
0:01:48.014,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to shake them into having difficult conversations.

32
0:01:52.655,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And I felt that I would be more effective if I did something visual.

33
0:01:57.484,000 --> 0:02:,000
And so at 21, I became a documentary filmmaker,

34
0:02:00.987,000 --> 0:02:03,000
turning my camera onto marginalized communities

35
0:02:04.128,000 --> 0:02:06,000
on the front lines in war zones,

36
0:02:06.772,000 --> 0:02:09,000
eventually returning home to Pakistan,

37
0:02:10.14,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where I wanted to document violence against women.

38
0:02:14.954,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Pakistan is home to 200 million people.

39
0:02:17.751,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And with its low levels of literacy,

40
0:02:20.231,000 --> 0:02:24,000
film can change the way people perceive issues.

41
0:02:26.492,000 --> 0:02:28,000
An effective storyteller speaks to our emotions,

42
0:02:30.544,000 --> 0:02:32,000
elicits empathy and compassion,

43
0:02:33.274,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and forces us to look at things differently.

44
0:02:37.116,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In my country, film had the potential to go beyond cinema.

45
0:02:42.735,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It could change lives.

46
0:02:45.536,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The issues that I've always wanted to raise --

47
0:02:49.272,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I've always wanted to hold up a mirror to society --

48
0:02:51.835,000 --> 0:02:54,000
they've been driven by my barometer of anger.

49
0:02:55.386,000 --> 0:03:,000
And my barometer of anger led me, in 2014, to honor killings.

50
0:03:01.397,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Honor killings take place in many parts of the world,

51
0:03:04.384,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where men punish women who transgress rules made by them:

52
0:03:09.436,000 --> 0:03:11,000
women who choose to marry on their own free will;

53
0:03:12.43,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or women who are looking for a divorce;

54
0:03:15.381,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or women who are suspected of having illicit relationships.

55
0:03:20.241,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In the rest of the world, honor killings would be known as murder.

56
0:03:27.979,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I always wanted to tell that story from the perspective of a survivor.

57
0:03:33.892,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But women do not live to tell their tale

58
0:03:37.109,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and instead end up in unmarked graves.

59
0:03:40.801,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So one morning when I was reading the newspaper,

60
0:03:43.375,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I read that a young woman had miraculously survived

61
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:5,000
after being shot in the face by her father and her uncle

62
0:03:50.539,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because she chose to marry a man out of her free will,

63
0:03:54.623,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I knew I had found my storyteller.

64
0:03:58.517,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Saba was determined to send her father and her uncle to jail,

65
0:04:02.53,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but in the days after leaving the hospital,

66
0:04:05.098,000 --> 0:04:08,000
pressure mounted on her to forgive.

67
0:04:08.122,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You see, there was a loophole in the law

68
0:04:10.475,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that allowed for victims to forgive perpetrators,

69
0:04:14.133,000 --> 0:04:17,000
enabling them to avoid jail time.

70
0:04:17.889,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And she was told that she would be ostracized

71
0:04:20.709,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and her family, her in-laws,

72
0:04:23.24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
they would all be shunned from the community,

73
0:04:25.589,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because many felt that her father had been well within his right,

74
0:04:29.696,000 --> 0:04:3,000
given her transgression.

75
0:04:32.917,000 --> 0:04:33,000
She fought on --

76
0:04:35.235,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for months.

77
0:04:36.642,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But on the final day in court,

78
0:04:39.386,000 --> 0:04:41,000
she gave a statement forgiving them.

79
0:04:44.003,000 --> 0:04:46,000
As filmmakers, we were devastated,

80
0:04:46.182,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because this was not the film that we had set out to make.

81
0:04:50.07,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In hindsight, had she pressed charges, fought the case and won,

82
0:04:55.875,000 --> 0:04:56,000
hers would have been an exception.

83
0:04:58.283,000 --> 0:05:01,000
When such a strong woman is silenced,

84
0:05:01.887,000 --> 0:05:03,000
what chance did other women have?

85
0:05:05.571,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we began to think about using our film

86
0:05:07.912,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to change the way people perceived honor killings,

87
0:05:12.086,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to impact the loophole in the law.

88
0:05:15.019,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And then our film was nominated for an Academy Award,

89
0:05:18.963,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and honor killings became headline news,

90
0:05:22.375,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the prime minister, while sending his congratulations,

91
0:05:26.057,000 --> 0:05:29,000
offered to host the first screening of the film at his office.

92
0:05:30.077,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Of course, we jumped at the chance,

93
0:05:31.929,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because no prime minister in the history of the country had ever done so.

94
0:05:36.016,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And at the screening,

95
0:05:37.226,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which was carried live on national television,

96
0:05:40.838,000 --> 0:05:44,000
he said something that reverberated throughout the country:

97
0:05:44.906,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"There is no honor in honor killings," he said.

98
0:05:48.349,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:55.939,000 --> 0:05:58,000
At the Academy Awards in LA,

100
0:05:59.004,000 --> 0:06:01,000
many of the pundits had written us off,

101
0:06:01.472,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but we felt that in order for the legislative push to continue,

102
0:06:05.435,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we needed that win.

103
0:06:07.838,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And then, my name was announced,

104
0:06:10.379,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I bounded up the steps in flip-flops, because I didn't expect to be onstage.

105
0:06:14.918,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

106
0:06:16.806,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And I accepted the statue, telling a billion people watching

107
0:06:20.512,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that the prime minister of Pakistan had pledged to change the law,

108
0:06:24.18,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because, of course, that's one way of holding the prime minister accountable.

109
0:06:27.951,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:29.604,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And --

111
0:06:30.791,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

112
0:06:35.712,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Back home, the Oscar win dominated headline news,

113
0:06:40.423,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and more people joined the fray,

114
0:06:42.887,000 --> 0:06:44,000
asking for the loophole in the law to be closed.

115
0:06:46.094,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And then in October 2016, after months of campaigning,

116
0:06:50.681,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the loophole was indeed closed.

117
0:06:53.181,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Applause)

118
0:06:57.487,000 --> 0:07:,000
And now men who kill women in the name of honor

119
0:07:00.984,000 --> 0:07:02,000
receive life imprisonment.

120
0:07:03.986,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

121
0:07:08.727,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Yet, the very next day,

122
0:07:11.307,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a woman was killed in the name of honor,

123
0:07:13.663,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and then another and another.

124
0:07:17.975,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We had impacted legislation,

125
0:07:20.753,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but that wasn't enough.

126
0:07:22.668,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We needed to take the film and its message to the heartland,

127
0:07:27.252,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to small towns and villages across the country.

128
0:07:31.98,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You see, for me, cinema can play a very positive role

129
0:07:37.972,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in changing and molding society in a positive direction.

130
0:07:43.432,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But how would we get to these places?

131
0:07:47.516,000 --> 0:07:49,000
How would we get to these small towns and villages?

132
0:07:52.044,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We built a mobile cinema,

133
0:07:54.678,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a truck that would roll through the length and breadth of the country,

134
0:07:59.524,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that would stop in small towns and villages.

135
0:08:03.278,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We outfitted it with a large screen that would light up the night sky,

136
0:08:07.774,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and we called it "Look But With Love."

137
0:08:10.501,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It would give the community an opportunity to come together

138
0:08:13.756,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and watch films in the evening.

139
0:08:15.937,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We knew we could attract men and children in the mobile cinema.

140
0:08:20.443,000 --> 0:08:21,000
They would come out and watch.

141
0:08:22.275,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But what about women?

142
0:08:23.679,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In these small, rural communities that are segregated,

143
0:08:27.404,000 --> 0:08:29,000
how would we get women to come out?

144
0:08:29.714,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We had to work with prevailing cultural norms in order to do so,

145
0:08:33.144,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and so we built a cinema inside the cinema,

146
0:08:36.114,000 --> 0:08:4,000
outfitting it with seats and a screen where women could go inside and watch

147
0:08:40.378,000 --> 0:08:41,000
without fearing

148
0:08:42.056,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or being embarrassed

149
0:08:43.592,000 --> 0:08:44,000
or harassment.

150
0:08:46.044,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We began to introduce everyone

151
0:08:49.17,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to films that opened up their minds to competing worldviews,

152
0:08:54.517,000 --> 0:08:56,000
encouraging children to build critical thinking

153
0:08:57.351,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so that they could ask questions.

154
0:08:59.968,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And we expanded our scope beyond honor killings,

155
0:09:03.309,000 --> 0:09:05,000
talking about income inequality,

156
0:09:06.23,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the environment,

157
0:09:07.871,000 --> 0:09:11,000
talking about ethnic relations, religious tolerance and compassion.

158
0:09:12.064,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And inside, for women,

159
0:09:14.076,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we showed them films in which they were heroes, not victims,

160
0:09:17.103,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and we told them how they could navigate the court system, the police system,

161
0:09:21.849,000 --> 0:09:22,000
educating them about their rights,

162
0:09:23.665,000 --> 0:09:25,000
telling them where they could seek refuge

163
0:09:25.999,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if they were victims of domestic violence,

164
0:09:29.237,000 --> 0:09:3,000
where they could go and get help.

165
0:09:32.722,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We were surprised that we were welcomed in so many of the places

166
0:09:36.251,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we went to.

167
0:09:40.031,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Many of the towns had never seen television or social media,

168
0:09:44.796,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and they were eager for their children to learn.

169
0:09:47.195,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But there was also pushback and blowback

170
0:09:49.681,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with the ideas that we were bringing with us.

171
0:09:53.362,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Two members of our mobile cinema team resigned

172
0:09:57.778,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because of threats from villages.

173
0:10:00.121,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And in one of the villages that we were screening in,

174
0:10:02.937,000 --> 0:10:03,000
they shut it down

175
0:10:04.118,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and said they didn't want the women to know about their rights.

176
0:10:07.171,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But on the flip side, in another village when a screening was shut down,

177
0:10:11.11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a plainclothes policeman got up and ordered it back on,

178
0:10:15.061,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and stood by, protecting our team,

179
0:10:17.198,000 --> 0:10:21,000
telling everyone that it was his duty to expose the young minds

180
0:10:21.261,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to an alternative worldview and to this content.

181
0:10:25.455,000 --> 0:10:26,000
He was an ordinary hero.

182
0:10:26.909,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But we've come across so many of these heroes on our journey.

183
0:10:31.301,000 --> 0:10:34,000
In another town, where the men said that only they could watch

184
0:10:34.704,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the women had to stay home,

185
0:10:36.256,000 --> 0:10:38,000
a community elder got up,

186
0:10:38.384,000 --> 0:10:41,000
got a group of people together, had a discussion,

187
0:10:41.684,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then both men and women sat down to watch together.

188
0:10:47.541,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We are documenting what we are doing.

189
0:10:50.735,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We talk to people.

190
0:10:52.345,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We adapt.

191
0:10:53.607,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We change the lineup of films.

192
0:10:56.698,000 --> 0:10:58,000
When we show men films

193
0:10:59.402,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that show perpetrators of violence behind bars,

194
0:11:02.78,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we want to hit home the fact that if men are violent,

195
0:11:05.555,000 --> 0:11:06,000
there will be repercussions.

196
0:11:07.862,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But we also show films where men are seen as championing women,

197
0:11:13.605,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because we want to encourage them to take on those roles.

198
0:11:18.74,000 --> 0:11:21,000
For women, when we show them films in which they are heads of state

199
0:11:22.245,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or where they are lawyers and doctors and in leadership positions,

200
0:11:26.363,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we talk to them and encourage them to step into those roles.

201
0:11:30.378,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We are changing the way people in these villages interact,

202
0:11:35.174,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and we're taking our learnings into other places.

203
0:11:38.713,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Recently, a group contacted us and wants to take our mobile cinema

204
0:11:43.148,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to Bangladesh and Syria,

205
0:11:44.674,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and we're sharing our learnings with them.

206
0:11:47.949,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We feel it's really important

207
0:11:50.393,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to take what we are doing and spread it across the world.

208
0:11:55.282,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In small towns and villages across Pakistan,

209
0:11:58.058,000 --> 0:12:01,000
men are changing the way they interact with women,

210
0:12:01.1,000 --> 0:12:04,000
children are changing the way they see the world,

211
0:12:04.521,000 --> 0:12:06,000
one village at a time, through cinema.

212
0:12:07.121,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Thank you.

213
0:12:08.301,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I got invited to speak to the people

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to perform at sporting events.

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Unfortunately I couldn't go.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But it got me thinking about

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the fact that these guys, at least most of them,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
know what it is that they do for a living.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
What they do is they dress up

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Shortly after that I got invited

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to speak at the convention of the people

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who make balloon animals.

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.

15
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
There is a big schism between the ones who make

16
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
gospel animals and porn animals, but --

17
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And the other thing about these guys

21
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is, they also know what they do for a living.

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They make balloon animals.

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But what do we do for a living?

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What exactly to the people watching this do every day?

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I want to argue that what we do

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is we try to change everything.

27
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
That we try to find a piece of the status quo --

28
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,

29
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it.

30
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We try to make big, permanent, important change.

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But we don't think about it that way.

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
what that process is like.

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I've been studying it for a couple years.

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I want to share a couple stories with you today.

36
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.

37
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.

38
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA

39
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.

40
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Cities gave them a charter

41
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.

42
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,

43
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.

44
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Nathan and his boss saw this,

45
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they could not tolerate it.

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So they set out to make San Francisco

47
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a no-kill city:

48
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
create an entire city

49
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
where every dog and cat,

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
unless it was ill or dangerous,

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
would be adopted, not killed.

52
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And everyone said it was impossible.

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country

55
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
flew to San Francisco

56
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to testify against them --

57
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.

59
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He connected with people who cared about this:

60
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
nonprofessionals, people with passion.

61
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And within just a couple years,

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
San Francisco became the first no-kill city,

63
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
running no deficit, completely supported by the community.

64
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York --

65
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
a place as different from San Francisco

66
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.

67
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher

68
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to completely transforming the community.

69
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.

70
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And he went to Reno and he did it again.

71
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And when I think about what Nathan did,

72
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.

73
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I think about the idea that

74
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
creating an idea, spreading an idea

75
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
has a lot behind it.

76
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,

77
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but what they do is, they take a light bulb

78
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and they smash it.

79
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.

80
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But one reason is because it indicates a change,

81
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from before to after.

82
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It is a moment in time.

83
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I want to argue that we are living through

84
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and are right at the key moment

85
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of a change in the way ideas are created

86
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and spread and implemented.

87
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We started with the factory idea:

88
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory

89
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that could churn out change.

90
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We then went to the TV idea,

91
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.

93
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And now we're in this new model of leadership,

94
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
where the way we make change

95
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is not by using money

96
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
or power to lever a system,

97
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but by leading.

98
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.

99
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.

100
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It enables him to hire men

101
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
who used to get paid 50 cents a day

102
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and pay them five dollars a day.

103
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Because he's got an efficient enough factory.

104
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Well with that sort of advantage

105
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you can churn out a lot of cars.

106
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.

107
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You can change the fabric of an entire country.

108
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That the essence of what you're doing is you need

109
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
ever-cheaper labor,

110
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and ever-faster machines.

111
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.

112
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.

113
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So we shift gears for a minute,

115
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and say, "I know: television;

116
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
advertising. Push push.

117
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Take a good idea and push it on the world.

118
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I have a better mousetrap.

119
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."

120
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And you can build an entire industry on that.

121
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.

122
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.

123
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.

124
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But be careful.

125
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,

126
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.

127
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This model requires you to act like the king,

129
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like the person in the front of the room

130
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
throwing things to the peons in the back.

131
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That you are in charge, and you're going to tell people

132
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
what to do next.

133
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,

134
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and you are pushing it out to the world.

135
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This method -- mass marketing --

136
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
requires average ideas,

137
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because you're going to the masses,

138
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and plenty of ads.

139
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What we've done as spammers

140
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is tried to hypnotize everyone

141
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
into buying our idea,

142
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,

143
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.

144
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.

145
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But there is good news around the corner -- really good news.

147
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I call it the idea of tribes.

148
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
What tribes are, is a very simple concept

149
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that goes back 50,000 years.

150
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.

151
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And it's something that people have wanted forever.

152
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,

153
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
having a work tribe,

154
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
having a community tribe.

155
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,

156
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
thanks to a lot of other things

157
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that are bubbling through our society around the world,

158
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
tribes are everywhere.

159
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.

160
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.

161
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.

162
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.

163
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You've got the organized armies over here.

164
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You've got the disorganized rebels over here.

165
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You've got people in white hats making food.

166
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And people in white hats sailing boats.

167
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers

168
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and connect with them,

169
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
because you want to be connected.

170
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That people on the fringes

171
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
can find each other, connect and go somewhere.

172
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Every town that has a volunteer fire department

173
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
understands this way of thinking.

174
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now it turns out

176
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.

177
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.

178
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And that what firemen do to train sometimes

179
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is they take a house that is going to be torn down,

180
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.

181
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But they always stop and take a picture.

182
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.

184
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.

185
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.

186
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And it turns out that it's tribes --

187
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
not money, not factories --

188
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that can change our world, that can change politics,

189
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that can align large numbers of people.

190
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Not because you force them to do something against their will,

191
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but because they wanted to connect.

192
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That what we do for a living now,

193
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
all of us, I think,

194
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is find something worth changing,

195
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes

196
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that spread the idea and spread the idea.

197
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,

198
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it becomes a movement.

199
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So when Al Gore set out

200
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to change the world again,

201
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
he didn't do it by himself.

202
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.

203
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
He did it by creating a movement.

204
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Thousands of people around the country

205
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
who could give his presentation for him,

206
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.

207
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You don't need everyone.

208
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,

209
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I don't know, a thousand true fans --

210
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a thousand people who care enough

211
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that they will get you the next round

212
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the next round and the next round.

213
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And that means that the idea you create, the product you create,

214
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the movement you create isn't for everyone,

215
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.

216
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What it's about instead

217
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
is finding the true believers.

218
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's easy to look at what I've said so far,

219
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."

220
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.

221
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They're about the same age. But that's about it.

222
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What they did, though, is each in their own way,

223
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
created a different way

224
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of navigating your way through technology.

225
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So some people will go out and get people to be on one team.

226
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And some people will get people to be on the other team.

227
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It also informs the decisions you make

228
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
when you make products or services.

229
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You know, this is one of my favorite devices.

230
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But what a shame that it's not organized

231
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to help authors create movements.

232
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,

233
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you could see the comments and quotes and notes

234
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.

235
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Or from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.

236
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
What would happen if authors, or people with ideas

237
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
could use version two, which comes out on Monday,

238
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and use it to organize people

239
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who want to talk about something.

240
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.

241
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But let me just try a couple.

242
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The Beatles did not invent teenagers.

243
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They merely decided to lead them.

244
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That most movements, most leadership that we're doing

245
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
is about finding a group that's disconnected

246
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but already has a yearning --

247
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
not persuading people to want something

248
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they don't have yet.

249
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
When Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,"

250
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
her video that spread all across the internet

251
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
about the way farm animals are treated,

252
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.

253
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.

254
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But she helped organize people,

255
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and helped turn it into a movement.

256
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected

257
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.

258
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.

259
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me."

260
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Derek Sivers invented CD Baby,

261
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
which allowed independent musicians

262
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --

263
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
to have place to take the mission

264
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.

265
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What all these people have in common is that they are heretics.

266
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That heretics look at the status quo and say,

267
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.

268
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.

269
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I see what the status quo is; I don't like it."

270
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
That instead of looking at all the little rules

271
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and following each one of them,

272
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker --

273
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
somebody who's half asleep,

274
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
following instructions,

275
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
keeping their head down, fitting in --

276
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."

277
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Someone stands up and says, "This one is important.

278
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We need to organize around it."

279
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.

280
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
You just need a few people --

281
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter) --

282
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
who will look at the rules,

283
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
realize they make no sense,

284
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and realize how much they want to be connected.

285
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.

286
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Zappos isn't a shoe store.

287
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Zappos is the one, the only,

288
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
the best-there-ever-was

289
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
place for people who are into shoes to find each other,

290
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to talk about their passion,

291
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to connect with people who care more

292
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.

293
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It can be something as prosaic as shoes,

294
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.

295
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It's exactly the same behavior though.

296
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
What it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,

297
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.

298
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,

299
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
then together we can get something that we all want.

300
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."

301
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered

302
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.

303
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.

304
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
She does it by telling a story

305
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to people who want to hear it.

306
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
By connecting a tribe of people

307
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
who are desperate to be connected to each other.

308
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
By leading a movement and

309
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
making change.

310
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And around and around and around it goes.

311
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So three questions I'd offer you.

312
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The first one is, who exactly

313
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
are you upsetting?

314
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.

315
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The second question is, who are you connecting?

316
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:

317
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the connections that are being made, one to the other.

318
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And the third one is, who are you leading?

319
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because focusing on that part of it --

320
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
not the mechanics of what you're building,

321
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but the who, and the leading part -- is where change comes.

322
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.

323
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes

324
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I gave exactly the same pair to someone

325
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"

326
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.

327
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It's a story of a product that tells a story.

328
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes

329
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and someone says, "What are those?"

330
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,

331
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
on behalf of the people who got the shoes.

332
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.

333
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.

334
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years

335
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
fighting against juvenile diabetes.

336
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them,

337
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
connecting them, challenging the status quo

338
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because it's important to him.

339
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.

340
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.

341
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
You don't need permission from people to lead them.

342
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But in case you do, here it is:

343
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
they're waiting, we're waiting

344
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
for you to show us where to go next.

345
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge

346
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
the status quo.

347
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They challenge what's currently there.

348
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
The second thing is, they build a culture.

349
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
A secret language, a seven-second handshake,

350
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
a way of knowing that you're in or out.

351
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,

352
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.

353
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
They connect people to one another.

354
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Do you know what people want more than anything?

355
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They want to be missed.

356
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
They want to be missed the day they don't show up.

357
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
They want to be missed when they're gone.

358
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And tribe leaders can do that.

359
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,

360
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but you don't need charisma to become a leader.

361
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Being a leader gives you charisma.

362
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,

363
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that's where charisma comes from -- from the leading.

364
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Finally, they commit.

365
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.

366
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They commit to the people who are there.

367
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So I'd like you to do something for me.

368
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.

369
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,

370
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
is: create a movement.

371
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.

372
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

373
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause)

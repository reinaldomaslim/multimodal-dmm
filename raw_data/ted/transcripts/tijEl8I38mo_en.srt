1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm going to talk to you today about

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
hopefully converting fear into hope.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When we go to the physician today --

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
there are words that we just don't want to hear.

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There are words that we're truly afraid of.

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
heart failure, lung failure --

9
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
things that we know are debilitating diseases,

10
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
for which there's relatively little that can be done.

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And what I want to lay out for you today is

12
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,

13
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
why it's important,

14
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down

15
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if you think it already hasn't,

16
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,

17
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and what some of the hurdles are.

18
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.

19
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I want to start with this slide,

20
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.

21
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This was an issue from 2002

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.

24
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that everybody can understand.

26
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself

27
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to a clinically relevant timescale.

28
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.

29
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.

30
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.

31
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.

32
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is not regenerative medicine.

33
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.

35
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms

36
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
with devices and drugs and the like --

37
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --

38
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body

39
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.

40
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So that at the end of the treatment,

41
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.

42
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --

43
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
very few good ideas are truly novel.

44
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And this is just the same.

45
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If you look back in history,

46
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,

47
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
was actually one of the first people

48
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,

49
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?

50
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And they published this book in 1937,

51
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
where they actually began to think about,

52
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:06,000
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?

53
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We've come a long way since then.

54
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.

55
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But before doing that, what I'd like to do

56
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is share my depression about the health care system

57
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the need for this with you.

58
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Many of the talks yesterday talked about

59
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,

60
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.

61
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.

62
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is

63
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to take care of our diseases as we get older.

64
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is simply the wealth of a country

65
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.

66
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,

67
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the older the people are within it.

68
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Why is this important?

69
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?

70
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If the average age of your population is 30,

71
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat

72
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,

73
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:06,000
maybe a little bit of asthma.

74
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,

75
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
now the average person is looking at diabetes,

76
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --

77
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
things that are inherently more difficult to treat,

78
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and much more expensive to treat.

79
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.

80
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is from "The Untied States of America."

81
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.

82
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,

83
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:41,000
paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.

84
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.

85
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.

86
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How can you actually afford to treat patients

87
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when the reality of getting old looks like this?

88
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is age versus cost of health care.

89
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,

90
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.

91
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,

92
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,

93
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
plotted over your lifetime.

94
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.

95
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And you can actually --

96
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
-- we won't get into that.

98
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do

100
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases

101
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and experience what I would call healthy aging.

102
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I'd suggest there are four things,

103
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.

104
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
All those things do is change who pays.

105
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.

106
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.

107
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.

108
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You can prevent.

109
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.

110
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,

111
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,

112
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and then treating the disease to cure the disease

113
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
instead of treating a symptom.

114
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.

115
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?

116
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,

117
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.

118
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.

119
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But eventually it stops working,

120
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.

121
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something

122
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,

123
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
perhaps even before it was symptomatic?

124
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,

125
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.

126
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.

127
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This is a newt re-growing its limb.

128
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:16,000
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?

129
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'll actually show you some more important features

130
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
about limb regeneration in a moment.

131
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine

132
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is doing this in every organ system of the body,

133
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for tissues and for organs themselves.

134
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So today's reality is that if we get sick,

135
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the message is we will treat your symptoms,

136
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and you need to adjust to a new way of life.

137
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I would pose to you that tomorrow --

138
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and when tomorrow is we could debate,

139
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but it's within the foreseeable future --

140
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.

141
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
There's a limb prosthetic up here,

142
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
similar actually one on the soldier

143
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that's come back from Iraq.

144
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.

145
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually

146
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
face the regeneration of that limb.

147
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's a wild concept.

148
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.

149
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.

150
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:18,000
How can we do that?

151
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.

152
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We need to learn to speak the body's language.

153
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.

154
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:35,000
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,

155
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
will re-grow that limb.

156
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.

157
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's a natural process,

158
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but it is lost as we age.

159
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In a child, before the age of about six months,

160
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
if they lose their fingertip in an accident,

161
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they'll re-grow their fingertip.

162
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.

163
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So to engage in that conversation with the body,

164
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
we need to speak the body's language.

165
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.

166
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools

167
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
through which to converse with the body.

168
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The first is cellular therapies.

169
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,

170
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
using cells to do most of the work.

171
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Therefore, if we can find the right cells

172
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.

173
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Secondly, we can use materials.

174
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.

175
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If we can invent materials, design materials,

176
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or extract materials from a natural environment,

177
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.

178
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices

179
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.

180
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I'm going to show you an example of each of these,

181
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I'm going to start with materials.

182
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --

183
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.

184
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,

185
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
if you threw away all the cells,

186
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,

187
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals

188
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that would signal the body to heal itself.

189
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And he asked a very important question.

190
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:2,000
He asked the question,

191
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
if I take that material, which is a natural material

192
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that usually induces healing in the small intestine,

193
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,

194
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
would it give a tissue-specific response,

195
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?

196
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.

197
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The picture I'm about to show you

198
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is a compelling picture.

199
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --

201
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --

202
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,

203
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:01,000
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.

204
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

205
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.

206
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.

207
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This is the reality of diabetes.

208
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,

209
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,

210
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
which is amputation, if you can't heal it.

211
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.

212
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.

213
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The treatment for this is amputation.

214
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,

215
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.

216
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,

217
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.

218
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.

219
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That material contained only natural signals.

220
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response

221
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that it didn't have before.

222
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --

223
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I'll let you know when you can look again.

224
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.

225
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.

226
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The horse just has another nostril that's developed

227
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
because of a riding accident.

228
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Just a few weeks after treatment --

229
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,

230
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --

231
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and the horse heals up.

232
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.

233
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.

234
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
There are now 400,000 patients around the world

235
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
who have used that material to heal their wounds.

236
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Could you regenerate a limb?

237
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project

238
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to begin the process of asking that question.

239
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.

240
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.

241
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.

242
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
After treatment that's what it looks like.

243
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This is happening today.

244
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
This is clinically relevant today.

245
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.

246
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But could you go a little further?

247
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Could you, say, instead of using material,

248
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
can I take some cells along with the material,

249
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and remove a damaged piece of tissue,

250
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:2,000
put a bio-degradable material on there?

251
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.

252
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.

253
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.

254
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
He chills the dish, it changes its properties

255
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and he peels it right out of the dish.

256
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It's the coolest stuff.

257
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.

258
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And what I'm going to show you here

259
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.

260
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.

261
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But this one's kind of cool.

262
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,

263
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:56,000
with a difference.

264
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,

265
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient

266
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure

267
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.

268
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And I'm standing up here because at one point

269
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.

270
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.

271
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And if you look really carefully,

272
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
it's going to be right around this point

273
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
you'll actually see a back-flush.

274
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
You see the cells coming back out.

275
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,

276
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.

277
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.

278
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
This was a randomized trial.

279
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:38,000
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.

280
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient

281
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.

282
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,

283
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.

284
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
These are now two years out.

285
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,

286
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:,000
and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.

287
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,

288
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart

289
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.

290
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:12,000
There go the cells.

291
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We don't have time to go into all of those details,

292
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but basically, that works too.

293
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
You can take patients who are less sick,

294
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state

295
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
through that kind of therapy.

296
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,

297
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but I think very soon will be.

298
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,

299
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
along with a number of colleagues around the world.

300
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
They've decided that liposuction fluid,

301
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.

302
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Laughter)

303
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It's a great source of stem cells.

304
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.

305
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.

306
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Out comes the liposuction fluid,

307
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.

308
0:15:58,000 --> 0:15:59,000
All done in the lab.

309
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated

310
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.

311
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I talked before about the use of devices

312
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to dramatically change the way we treat disease.

313
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Here's just one example before I close up.

314
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
This is equally tragic.

315
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership

316
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:23,000
with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,

317
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:28,000
who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.

318
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Many of those patients are very severely burned.

319
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,

320
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
it's that we don't know how to treat it.

321
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Everything that is done to treat burn --

322
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
basically we do a sodding approach.

323
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We make something over here,

324
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,

325
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and we try and get the two to take.

326
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:49,000
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --

327
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --

328
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:54,000

329
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.

330
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
The gun that you see there sprays cells.

331
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
That's going to spray cells over that area.

332
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:06,000
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,

333
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
deliver other things as well at the same time,

334
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and therefore we will seed that lawn,

335
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
as opposed to try the sodding approach.

336
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
It's a completely different way of doing it.

337
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So my 18 minutes is up.

338
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So let me finish up with some good news,

339
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and maybe a little bit of bad news.

340
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
The good news is that this is happening today.

341
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's very powerful work.

342
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Clearly the images kind of get that across.

343
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.

344
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice

345
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:42,000
is involved in trying to get this to happen.

346
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
A number of governments, and a number of regions,

347
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.

348
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
The Japanese government were perhaps the first,

349
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:53,000
when they decided to invest first 3 billion,

350
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:56,000
later another 2 billion in this field.

351
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:57,000
It's no coincidence.

352
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:,000
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.

353
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:04,000
They need this to work or their health system dies.

354
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.

355
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
The European Union, same thing.

356
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:13,000
China, the same thing.

357
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:15,000
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.

358
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:19,000
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.

359
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:23,000
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.

360
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Laughter)

361
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.

362
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:31,000
We've had a different approach.

363
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.

364
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
But there's been no strategic investment

365
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.

366
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,

367
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:51,000
at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.

368
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard

369
0:18:55,000 --> 0:19:,000
went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute

370
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:02,000
just a few months ago,

371
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:08,000
to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece

372
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:12,000
of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year

373
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace

374
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:19,000
at which these things get to patients.

375
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And at the end of a very testy meeting,

376
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:24,000
what the NIH director said was,

377
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:26,000
"Your vision is larger than our appetite."

378
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,

379
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:32,000
but together we can change his appetite.

380
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Thank you.

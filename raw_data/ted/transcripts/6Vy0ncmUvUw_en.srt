1
0:00:18.725,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What I want to do today is spend some time talking about some stuff

2
0:00:22.401,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that's giving me a little bit of existential angst,

3
0:00:26.01,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for lack of a better word,

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
over the past couple of years.

5
0:00:29.44,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And basically, these three quotes tell what's going on.

6
0:00:34.692,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"When God made the color purple, God was just showing off,"

7
0:00:37.98,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple."

8
0:00:40.523,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And Zora Neale Hurston wrote in "Dust Tracks On A Road,"

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"Research is a formalized curiosity.

10
0:00:47.18,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's poking and prying with a purpose."

11
0:00:50.274,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And then finally, when I think about the near future,

12
0:00:52.791,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we have this attitude, "Well, whatever happens, happens."

13
0:00:56.097,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Right?

14
0:00:57.282,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So that goes along with the Cheshire Cat saying,

15
0:00:59.844,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"If you don't care much where you want to get to,

16
0:01:02.226,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it doesn't much matter which way you go."

17
0:01:04.392,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I think it does matter which way we go and what road we take,

18
0:01:08.71,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because when I think about design in the near future,

19
0:01:11.578,000 --> 0:01:13,000
what I think are the most important issues,

20
0:01:13.909,000 --> 0:01:14,000
what's really crucial and vital,

21
0:01:15.906,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now,

22
0:01:20.716,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in 2002.

23
0:01:22.673,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:27.182,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If we describe the near future as 10, 20, 15 years from now,

25
0:01:31.572,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that means that what we do today is going to be critically important,

26
0:01:35.415,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because in the year 2015, in the year 2020, 2025,

27
0:01:39.42,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the world our society is going to be building on,

28
0:01:42.114,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,

29
0:01:44.61,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the discoveries that we came up with today,

30
0:01:47.735,000 --> 0:01:49,000
just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about

31
0:01:50.723,000 --> 0:01:51,000
here at the TED conference

32
0:01:52.003,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that we take for granted in the world right now,

33
0:01:54.814,000 --> 0:01:56,000
were really knowledge and ideas that came up

34
0:01:57.401,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in the 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

35
0:02:00.176,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's the substrate that we're exploiting today.

36
0:02:02.581,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Whether it's the internet,

37
0:02:03.929,000 --> 0:02:04,000
genetic engineering, laser scanners,

38
0:02:05.796,000 --> 0:02:08,000
guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition television,

39
0:02:09.984,000 --> 0:02:13,000
remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote-sensing photos

40
0:02:14.189,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker and Enterprise,

41
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:23,000
CD-rewrite drives, flat-screen, Alvin Ailey's "Suite Otis,"

42
0:02:23.439,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or Sarah Jones's "Your Revolution Will Not [Happen] Between These Thighs,"

43
0:02:27.044,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which, by the way, was banned by the FCC,

44
0:02:29.038,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or ska --

45
0:02:30.213,000 --> 0:02:34,000
all of these things, without question, almost without exception,

46
0:02:34.513,000 --> 0:02:37,000
are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity

47
0:02:38.293,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from years before.

48
0:02:39.908,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So we have to ask ourselves:

49
0:02:41.402,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What are we contributing to that legacy right now?

50
0:02:44.435,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And when I think about it,

51
0:02:46.012,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'm really worried.

52
0:02:47.19,000 --> 0:02:49,000
To be quite frank, I'm concerned.

53
0:02:49.343,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything.

54
0:02:52.593,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're, in a sense,

55
0:02:54.38,000 --> 0:02:56,000
failing to act in the future.

56
0:02:57.03,000 --> 0:03:,000
We're purposefully, consciously being laggards.

57
0:03:00.213,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We're lagging behind.

58
0:03:02.097,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist from Martinique, said,

59
0:03:05.079,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"Each generation must, out of relative obscurity,

60
0:03:08.025,000 --> 0:03:09,000
discover its mission

61
0:03:09.743,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and fulfill or betray it."

62
0:03:13.633,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What is our mission? What do we have to do?

63
0:03:15.687,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I think our mission is to reconcile, to reintegrate

64
0:03:19.183,000 --> 0:03:21,000
science and the arts,

65
0:03:21.556,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because right now, there's a schism that exists in popular culture.

66
0:03:26.307,000 --> 0:03:3,000
People have this idea that science and the arts are really separate;

67
0:03:30.577,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we think of them as separate and different things.

68
0:03:32.954,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And this idea was probably introduced centuries ago,

69
0:03:36.163,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but it's really becoming critical now,

70
0:03:39.11,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because we're making decisions about our society every day

71
0:03:43.591,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that, if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences,

72
0:03:48.824,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we keep thinking it's cute to say,

73
0:03:50.705,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"I don't understand anything about this one,

74
0:03:52.801,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I don't understand anything about the other one,"

75
0:03:55.206,000 --> 0:03:56,000
then we're going to have problems.

76
0:03:56.882,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, I know no one here at TED thinks this.

77
0:03:58.945,000 --> 0:04:,000
All of us, we already know that they're very connected.

78
0:04:01.585,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world,

79
0:04:04.804,000 --> 0:04:06,000
believe it or not, think it's neat when they say,

80
0:04:07.172,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Scientists and science is not creative.

81
0:04:10.466,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Maybe scientists are ingenious, but they're not creative."

82
0:04:13.803,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And then we have this tendency,

83
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the career counselors and various people say things

84
0:04:17.868,000 --> 0:04:19,000
like, "Artists are not analytical.

85
0:04:20.505,000 --> 0:04:21,000
They're ingenious, perhaps,

86
0:04:23.109,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but not analytical."

87
0:04:25.401,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And when these concepts underlie our teaching

88
0:04:27.807,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and what we think about the world,

89
0:04:29.727,000 --> 0:04:3,000
then we have a problem,

90
0:04:31.077,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because we stymie support for everything.

91
0:04:33.211,000 --> 0:04:34,000
By accepting this dichotomy,

92
0:04:34.855,000 --> 0:04:36,000
whether it's tongue-in-cheek,

93
0:04:36.99,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when we attempt to accommodate it in our world,

94
0:04:39.555,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and we try to build our foundation for the world,

95
0:04:41.934,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we're messing up the future,

96
0:04:43.496,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because: Who wants to be uncreative?

97
0:04:46.394,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Who wants to be illogical?

98
0:04:48.108,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Talent would run from either of these fields

99
0:04:50.196,000 --> 0:04:51,000
if you said you had to choose either.

100
0:04:51.993,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Then they'll go to something where they think,

101
0:04:54.23,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Well, I can be creative and logical at the same time."

102
0:04:56.86,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it --

103
0:04:59.547,000 --> 0:05:02,000
actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,

104
0:05:02.623,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and I was a wannabe hippie,

105
0:05:04.297,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I always resented the fact that I wasn't old enough to be a hippie.

106
0:05:08.846,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I know there are people here, the younger generation,

107
0:05:11.741,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who want to be hippies.

108
0:05:13.229,000 --> 0:05:15,000
People talk about the '60s all the time.

109
0:05:15.307,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And they talk about the anarchy that was there.

110
0:05:17.538,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But when I think about the '60s,

111
0:05:19.158,000 --> 0:05:22,000
what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future.

112
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We thought everyone could participate.

113
0:05:24.994,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There were wonderful, incredible ideas that were always percolating,

114
0:05:29.043,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and so much of what's cool or hot today

115
0:05:32.105,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is really based on some of those concepts,

116
0:05:34.177,000 --> 0:05:37,000
whether it's people trying to use the Prime Directive from Star Trek,

117
0:05:37.741,000 --> 0:05:38,000
being involved in things,

118
0:05:39.612,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or, again, that three-dimensional weaving and fax machines

119
0:05:42.702,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that I read about in my weekly readers

120
0:05:44.584,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that the technology and engineering was just getting started.

121
0:05:47.535,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But the '60s left me with a problem.

122
0:05:49.315,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You see, I always assumed I would go into space,

123
0:05:53.984,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because I followed all of this.

124
0:05:55.674,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But I also loved the arts and sciences.

125
0:05:58.497,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You see, when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager,

126
0:06:01.645,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I loved designing and making doll clothes

127
0:06:04.124,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and wanting to be a fashion designer.

128
0:06:05.939,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I took art and ceramics.

129
0:06:07.261,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I loved dance: Lola Falana, Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins.

130
0:06:13.442,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs.

131
0:06:17.611,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I had science projects and tons of astronomy books.

132
0:06:21.002,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I took calculus and philosophy.

133
0:06:22.636,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I wondered about infinity and the Big Bang theory.

134
0:06:26.396,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And when I was at Stanford, I found myself, my senior year,

135
0:06:29.627,000 --> 0:06:3,000
chemical engineering major,

136
0:06:30.957,000 --> 0:06:33,000
half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major,

137
0:06:34.513,000 --> 0:06:37,000
which was sort of true, because I was Black Student Union President,

138
0:06:37.776,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and I did major in some other things.

139
0:06:39.577,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I found myself the last quarter

140
0:06:41.285,000 --> 0:06:43,000
juggling chemical engineering separation processes,

141
0:06:43.714,000 --> 0:06:46,000
logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,

142
0:06:46.916,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and also producing and choreographing a dance production.

143
0:06:51.01,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I had to do the lighting and the design work,

144
0:06:53.614,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and I was trying to figure out:

145
0:06:55.922,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer,

146
0:06:59.181,000 --> 0:07:,000
or to go to medical school?

147
0:07:00.863,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now, my mother helped me figure that one out.

148
0:07:03.124,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:06.243,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But when I went into space, I carried a number of things up with me.

150
0:07:10.921,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey --

151
0:07:12.723,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you can figure out now, I love the dance company --

152
0:07:15.19,000 --> 0:07:18,000
an Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance "Cry,"

153
0:07:18.594,000 --> 0:07:2,000
dedicated to all black women everywhere;

154
0:07:20.655,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a Bundu statue, which was from the women's society in Sierra Leone;

155
0:07:24.418,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students

156
0:07:27.081,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to work to improve their science and math.

157
0:07:30.919,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And folks asked me,

158
0:07:32.816,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"Why did you take up what you took up?"

159
0:07:35.705,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I had to say,

160
0:07:36.887,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Because it represents human creativity;

161
0:07:39.464,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the creativity that allowed us,

162
0:07:41.935,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch

163
0:07:44.885,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the space shuttle,

164
0:07:46.075,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis

165
0:07:49.207,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that it took to carve a Bundu statue,

166
0:07:51.328,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or the ingenuity it took to design, choreograph and stage "Cry."

167
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
Each one of them are different manifestations, incarnations,

168
0:08:00.866,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of creativity -- avatars of human creativity.

169
0:08:05.114,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And that's what we have to reconcile in our minds,

170
0:08:07.492,000 --> 0:08:08,000
how these things fit together.

171
0:08:08.97,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive.

172
0:08:13.368,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Right?

173
0:08:14.543,000 --> 0:08:17,000
E = mc2 required an intuitive leap,

174
0:08:18.359,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and then you had to do the analysis afterwards.

175
0:08:21.514,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Einstein said, in fact,

176
0:08:22.856,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"The most beautiful thing we can experience

177
0:08:25.044,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is the mysterious.

178
0:08:26.372,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It is the source of all true art and science."

179
0:08:29.673,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Dance requires us to express and want to express

180
0:08:32.642,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the jubilation in life,

181
0:08:33.833,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but then you have to figure out:

182
0:08:35.436,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Exactly what movement do I do

183
0:08:36.877,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to make sure it comes across correctly?

184
0:08:39.018,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The difference between arts and sciences

185
0:08:40.982,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is also not constructive versus deconstructive.

186
0:08:44.523,000 --> 0:08:46,000
A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive,

187
0:08:47.206,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you have to pull things apart.

188
0:08:48.831,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And yeah, subatomic physics is deconstructive --

189
0:08:51.917,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you literally try to tear atoms apart

190
0:08:54.545,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to understand what's inside of them.

191
0:08:56.605,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But sculpture, from what I understand from great sculptors,

192
0:09:00.18,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is deconstructive,

193
0:09:01.385,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there.

194
0:09:04.73,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Biotechnology is constructive.

195
0:09:07.006,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Orchestral arranging is constructive.

196
0:09:09.481,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So, in fact, we use constructive and deconstructive techniques

197
0:09:12.616,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in everything.

198
0:09:14.12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The difference between science and the arts

199
0:09:17.763,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is not that they are different sides of the same coin, even,

200
0:09:21.218,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or even different parts of the same continuum,

201
0:09:23.54,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but rather, they're manifestations of the same thing.

202
0:09:27.499,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Different quantum states of an atom?

203
0:09:30.321,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century,

204
0:09:32.392,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I could say that they're different harmonic resonances of a superstring.

205
0:09:35.824,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But we'll leave that alone.

206
0:09:37.192,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They spring from the same source.

207
0:09:39.384,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity.

208
0:09:42.626,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's our attempt as humans

209
0:09:44.126,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to build an understanding of the universe, the world around us.

210
0:09:47.627,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's our attempt to influence things,

211
0:09:50.157,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the universe internal to ourselves

212
0:09:52.312,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and external to us.

213
0:09:53.831,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The sciences, to me, are manifestations of our attempt to express or share

214
0:09:59.461,000 --> 0:10:01,000
our understanding, our experience,

215
0:10:02.173,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to influence the universe external to ourselves.

216
0:10:05.412,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.

217
0:10:08.167,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's the universe, as experienced by everyone.

218
0:10:11.577,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The arts manifest our desire,

219
0:10:13.93,000 --> 0:10:15,000
our attempt to share or influence others

220
0:10:16.261,000 --> 0:10:19,000
through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals.

221
0:10:20.719,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Let me say it again another way:

222
0:10:22.291,000 --> 0:10:26,000
science provides an understanding of a universal experience,

223
0:10:26.74,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and arts provide a universal understanding

224
0:10:29.98,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of a personal experience.

225
0:10:32.832,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That's what we have to think about,

226
0:10:34.891,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that they're all part of us, they're all part of a continuum.

227
0:10:37.825,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It's not just the tools, it's not just the sciences,

228
0:10:41.051,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics,

229
0:10:44.049,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because we heard, very much on this stage,

230
0:10:46.118,000 --> 0:10:48,000
people talked about music being mathematical.

231
0:10:49.923,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Arts don't just use clay,

232
0:10:51.57,000 --> 0:10:54,000
aren't the only ones that use clay, light and sound and movement.

233
0:10:55.776,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They use analysis as well.

234
0:10:59.973,000 --> 0:11:,000
So people might say,

235
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
"Well, I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing,"

236
0:11:04.067,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because everybody wants to do the right brain, left brain thing.

237
0:11:07.122,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We've all been accused of being right-brained or left-brained

238
0:11:10.035,000 --> 0:11:11,000
at some point in time,

239
0:11:11.219,000 --> 0:11:12,000
depending on who we disagreed with.

240
0:11:13.063,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

241
0:11:14.411,000 --> 0:11:15,000
You know, people say "intuitive" --

242
0:11:16.329,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that's like you're in touch with nature,

243
0:11:18.288,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in touch with yourself and relationships;

244
0:11:20.297,000 --> 0:11:22,000
analytical, you put your mind to work.

245
0:11:22.554,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all know this, though.

246
0:11:25.647,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But sometimes people use this analysis idea,

247
0:11:27.77,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that things are outside of ourselves,

248
0:11:29.626,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to say, this is what we're going to elevate

249
0:11:33.104,000 --> 0:11:36,000
as the true, most important sciences, right?

250
0:11:36.182,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Then you have artists -- and you all know this is true as well --

251
0:11:39.665,000 --> 0:11:42,000
artists will say things about scientists

252
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because they say they're too concrete, they're disconnected from the world.

253
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But, we've even had that here on stage,

254
0:11:49.662,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

255
0:11:52.427,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:53.645,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We had folks talking about the Flat Earth Society

257
0:11:56.009,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and flower arrangers,

258
0:11:57.208,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so there's this whole dichotomy

259
0:11:59.146,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that we continue to carry along, even when we know better.

260
0:12:02.841,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And folks say we need to choose either-or.

261
0:12:06.492,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But it would really be foolish to choose either one,

262
0:12:09.422,000 --> 0:12:11,000
intuitive versus analytical.

263
0:12:11.46,000 --> 0:12:12,000
That's a foolish choice.

264
0:12:12.671,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's foolish just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic.

265
0:12:17.198,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You need both in life.

266
0:12:19.167,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Why do people do this?

267
0:12:20.347,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I'm going to quote a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,

268
0:12:23.076,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who's 70 years old, so he can say this.

269
0:12:24.983,000 --> 0:12:27,000
He said, "It's always important to distinguish between chastity

270
0:12:28.22,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and impotence."

271
0:12:29.83,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now --

272
0:12:31.039,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

273
0:12:33.166,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I want to share with you a little equation, OK?

274
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
How does understanding science and the arts fit into our lives

275
0:12:44.221,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and what's going on

276
0:12:45.4,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and the things we're talking about here at the design conference?

277
0:12:48.527,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And this is a little thing I came up with:

278
0:12:50.629,000 --> 0:12:51,000
understanding

279
0:12:51.82,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and our resources and our will

280
0:12:54.174,000 --> 0:12:55,000
cause us to have outcomes.

281
0:12:55.509,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Our understanding is our science, our arts, our religion;

282
0:12:58.617,000 --> 0:13:,000
how we see the universe around us;

283
0:13:00.976,000 --> 0:13:02,000
our resources, our money, our labor, our minerals --

284
0:13:03.697,000 --> 0:13:06,000
those things that are out there in the world we have to work with.

285
0:13:06.885,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But more importantly, there's our will.

286
0:13:09.532,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is our vision,

287
0:13:10.725,000 --> 0:13:12,000
our aspirations of the future, our hopes, our dreams,

288
0:13:13.338,000 --> 0:13:14,000
our struggles and our fears.

289
0:13:14.743,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those.

290
0:13:18.466,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And to me, design and engineering, craftsmanship and skilled labor,

291
0:13:22.611,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are all the things that work on this to have our outcome,

292
0:13:25.809,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which is our human quality of life.

293
0:13:28.397,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Where do we want the world to be?

294
0:13:30.776,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And guess what?

295
0:13:31.967,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Regardless of how we look at this,

296
0:13:33.639,000 --> 0:13:35,000
whether we look at arts and sciences as separate or different,

297
0:13:36.62,000 --> 0:13:39,000
they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems.

298
0:13:39.869,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:

299
0:13:41.982,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Science, Engineering and Education.

300
0:13:43.703,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It was looking at how to shed light

301
0:13:45.433,000 --> 0:13:47,000
on the most effective use of government funding.

302
0:13:47.726,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers.

303
0:13:50.616,000 --> 0:13:52,000
They came to Dartmouth College, where I was teaching.

304
0:13:53.138,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And they talked about, with theologians and financiers:

305
0:13:55.798,000 --> 0:13:57,000
What are some of the issues of public funding

306
0:13:57.947,000 --> 0:13:58,000
for science and engineering research?

307
0:13:59.795,000 --> 0:14:,000
What's most important about it?

308
0:14:02.068,000 --> 0:14:03,000
There are some ideas that emerged

309
0:14:03.696,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts.

310
0:14:06.368,000 --> 0:14:08,000
The first thing they said was that the circumstances

311
0:14:08.892,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering

312
0:14:12.314,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that made us world leaders

313
0:14:13.917,000 --> 0:14:18,000
are very different than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s,

314
0:14:19.198,000 --> 0:14:2,000
when we emerged as world leaders,

315
0:14:20.834,000 --> 0:14:22,000
because we're no longer in competition with fascism,

316
0:14:23.311,000 --> 0:14:24,000
with Soviet-style communism.

317
0:14:24.73,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And by the way, that competition wasn't just military;

318
0:14:28.126,000 --> 0:14:32,000
it included social competition and political competition as well,

319
0:14:32.583,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms

320
0:14:36.215,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to prove that our social system was better.

321
0:14:38.58,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Another thing they talked about was that the infrastructure

322
0:14:41.921,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that supports the sciences

323
0:14:43.29,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is becoming obsolete.

324
0:14:44.612,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We look at universities and colleges --

325
0:14:47.132,000 --> 0:14:5,000
small, mid-sized community colleges across the country --

326
0:14:50.314,000 --> 0:14:52,000
their laboratories are becoming obsolete.

327
0:14:52.752,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And this is where we train most of our science workers

328
0:14:55.426,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and our researchers -- and our teachers, by the way.

329
0:14:58.684,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than

330
0:15:03.461,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the most mundane and inane of information.

331
0:15:06.373,000 --> 0:15:09,000
There's pseudoscience, crop circles, alien autopsy, haunted houses,

332
0:15:09.815,000 --> 0:15:1,000
or disasters.

333
0:15:11.057,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And that's what we see.

334
0:15:12.455,000 --> 0:15:15,000
This isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life

335
0:15:15.802,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and figure out how to participate in this democracy

336
0:15:18.218,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and determine what's going on.

337
0:15:19.944,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They also said there's a change in the corporate mentality.

338
0:15:22.733,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Whereas government money had always been there

339
0:15:24.919,000 --> 0:15:26,000
for basic science and engineering research,

340
0:15:27.034,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we also counted on some companies to do some basic research.

341
0:15:30.82,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But what's happened now is companies put more energy

342
0:15:33.665,000 --> 0:15:35,000
into short-term product development

343
0:15:36.967,000 --> 0:15:39,000
than they do in basic engineering and science research.

344
0:15:41.738,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And education is not keeping up.

345
0:15:44.437,000 --> 0:15:47,000
In K through 12, people are taking out wet labs.

346
0:15:48.12,000 --> 0:15:5,000
They think if we put a computer in the room,

347
0:15:50.22,000 --> 0:15:53,000
it's going to take the place of actually mixing the acids

348
0:15:53.516,000 --> 0:15:54,000
or growing the potatoes.

349
0:15:55.039,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And government funding is decreasing in spending,

350
0:15:57.371,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and then they're saying, let's have corporations take over,

351
0:16:00.19,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and that's not true.

352
0:16:01.37,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Government funding should at least do things

353
0:16:04.58,000 --> 0:16:07,000
like recognize cost benefits of basic science and engineering research.

354
0:16:08.535,000 --> 0:16:11,000
We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens

355
0:16:11.652,000 --> 0:16:12,000
in this world.

356
0:16:12.834,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We have to look at the education of humans.

357
0:16:14.904,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained

358
0:16:18.263,000 --> 0:16:2,000
so they understand the importance of these things.

359
0:16:20.661,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And we have to support the vitality of science.

360
0:16:23.909,000 --> 0:16:26,000
That doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on,

361
0:16:27.856,000 --> 0:16:29,000
or that we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it,

362
0:16:30.754,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity

363
0:16:33.837,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that goes along [with it].

364
0:16:35.109,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And if you think about those parallels to the arts --

365
0:16:37.656,000 --> 0:16:41,000
the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred

366
0:16:41.75,000 --> 0:16:44,000
the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better.

367
0:16:45.023,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Infrastructure, museums, theaters, movie houses across the country

368
0:16:49.249,000 --> 0:16:5,000
are disappearing.

369
0:16:50.425,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We have more television stations with less to watch,

370
0:16:52.888,000 --> 0:16:55,000
we have more money spent on rewrites

371
0:16:56.671,000 --> 0:16:57,000
to get old television programs

372
0:16:58.58,000 --> 0:16:59,000
in the movies.

373
0:17:00.731,000 --> 0:17:02,000
We have corporate funding now that,

374
0:17:03.127,000 --> 0:17:06,000
when it goes to support the arts,

375
0:17:06.512,000 --> 0:17:09,000
it almost requires that the product be part of the picture

376
0:17:09.715,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that the artist draws.

377
0:17:11.036,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations.

378
0:17:14.965,000 --> 0:17:17,000
In Houston, we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.

379
0:17:18.771,000 --> 0:17:19,000
(Laughter)

380
0:17:19.814,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Fine arts and education in the schools is disappearing,

381
0:17:22.719,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA

382
0:17:26.473,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and other programs.

383
0:17:27.66,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So we have to really stop and think:

384
0:17:29.783,000 --> 0:17:32,000
What are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts?

385
0:17:32.839,000 --> 0:17:33,000
There's a need to revitalize them.

386
0:17:34.736,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We have to pay attention to it.

387
0:17:36.331,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I just want to tell you quickly what I'm doing --

388
0:17:39.421,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Applause)

389
0:17:46.369,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since ...

390
0:17:50.318,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas

391
0:17:53.784,000 --> 0:17:55,000
that I've had and run across over time.

392
0:17:56.208,000 --> 0:18:,000
One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair

393
0:18:00.58,000 --> 0:18:02,000
the dichotomy between the mind and body as well.

394
0:18:03.167,000 --> 0:18:05,000
My mother always told me, you have to be observant,

395
0:18:05.84,000 --> 0:18:07,000
know what's going on in your mind and your body.

396
0:18:08.106,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And as a dancer, I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body,

397
0:18:11.804,000 --> 0:18:12,000
just as I knew how to sense colors.

398
0:18:14.286,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Then I went to medical school,

399
0:18:16.627,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies.

400
0:18:20.842,000 --> 0:18:23,000
You know, you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you,

401
0:18:24.414,000 --> 0:18:25,000
"Don't listen to what the patient said."

402
0:18:26.346,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We know that patients know and understand their bodies better,

403
0:18:29.314,000 --> 0:18:32,000
but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea.

404
0:18:32.848,000 --> 0:18:35,000
We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body

405
0:18:36.764,000 --> 0:18:37,000
with physicians' measurements.

406
0:18:39.658,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We had someone talk about measuring emotions

407
0:18:42.599,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and getting machines to figure out what to keep us from acting crazy.

408
0:18:47.36,000 --> 0:18:48,000
No, we shouldn't measure.

409
0:18:48.769,000 --> 0:18:5,000
We shouldn't use machines to measure road rage

410
0:18:51.102,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and then do something to keep us from engaging in it.

411
0:18:53.635,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage,

412
0:18:57.627,000 --> 0:19:,000
and then we need to know how to control that without the machines.

413
0:19:00.832,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines.

414
0:19:04.117,000 --> 0:19:06,000
What I'm very concerned about is:

415
0:19:06.643,000 --> 0:19:11,000
How do we bolster our self-awareness as humans, as biological organisms?

416
0:19:12.316,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach

417
0:19:15.149,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and learn how to feel with my eyes, to see with my hands.

418
0:19:19.75,000 --> 0:19:22,000
We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by,

419
0:19:23.761,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and that's what we have to do.

420
0:19:25.934,000 --> 0:19:26,000
That's what I want to do --

421
0:19:27.789,000 --> 0:19:3,000
to try to use bioinstrumentation, those kind of things,

422
0:19:31.19,000 --> 0:19:34,000
to help our senses in what we do.

423
0:19:34.299,000 --> 0:19:35,000
That's the work I've been doing now,

424
0:19:36.042,000 --> 0:19:38,000
as a company called BioSentient Corporation.

425
0:19:38.128,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I figured I'd have to do that ad, because I'm an entrepreneur,

426
0:19:41.075,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and "entrepreneur" says "somebody who does what they want to do,

427
0:19:45.25,000 --> 0:19:48,000
because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job."

428
0:19:48.451,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Laughter)

429
0:19:49.477,000 --> 0:19:51,000
But that's the work I'm doing, BioSentient Corporation,

430
0:19:52.091,000 --> 0:19:54,000
trying to figure out: How do we integrate these things?

431
0:19:54.711,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future

432
0:19:59.412,000 --> 0:20:,000
is really about integrating;

433
0:20:01.398,000 --> 0:20:03,000
to think about that intuitive and that analytical.

434
0:20:04.239,000 --> 0:20:06,000
The arts and sciences are not separate.

435
0:20:07.42,000 --> 0:20:09,000
High school physics lesson before you leave:

436
0:20:09.884,000 --> 0:20:11,000
high school physics teacher used to hold up a ball.

437
0:20:12.298,000 --> 0:20:14,000
She would say, "This ball has potential energy.

438
0:20:15.042,000 --> 0:20:17,000
But nothing will happen to it, it can't do any work,

439
0:20:17.569,000 --> 0:20:19,000
until I drop it and it changes states."

440
0:20:20.411,000 --> 0:20:22,000
I like to think of ideas as potential energy.

441
0:20:23.092,000 --> 0:20:24,000
They're really wonderful,

442
0:20:24.952,000 --> 0:20:28,000
but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action.

443
0:20:29.246,000 --> 0:20:32,000
This conference is filled with wonderful ideas.

444
0:20:33.452,000 --> 0:20:35,000
We're going to share lots of things with people.

445
0:20:35.983,000 --> 0:20:36,000
But nothing's going to happen

446
0:20:37.72,000 --> 0:20:4,000
until we risk putting those ideas into action.

447
0:20:40.862,000 --> 0:20:42,000
We need to revitalize the arts and sciences today.

448
0:20:43.614,000 --> 0:20:45,000
We need to take responsibility for the future.

449
0:20:46.133,000 --> 0:20:49,000
We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits,

450
0:20:49.781,000 --> 0:20:5,000
or it's just a business,

451
0:20:51.032,000 --> 0:20:53,000
or I'm an artist or an academician.

452
0:20:54.039,000 --> 0:20:56,000
Here's how you judge what you're doing:

453
0:20:56.095,000 --> 0:20:59,000
I talked about that balance between intuitive, analytical.

454
0:21:00.6,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,

455
0:21:03.412,000 --> 0:21:05,000
said, "The three questions of greatest concern ..." --

456
0:21:06.019,000 --> 0:21:07,000
now I'm going to add on to design --

457
0:21:07.91,000 --> 0:21:09,000
"... are: Is it attractive?"

458
0:21:11.299,000 --> 0:21:12,000
That's the intuitive.

459
0:21:13.017,000 --> 0:21:15,000
"Is it amusing?" -- the analytical,

460
0:21:15.632,000 --> 0:21:17,000
and, "Does it know its place?" -- the balance.

461
0:21:18.341,000 --> 0:21:19,000
Thank you very much.

462
0:21:19.537,000 --> 0:21:21,000
(Applause)

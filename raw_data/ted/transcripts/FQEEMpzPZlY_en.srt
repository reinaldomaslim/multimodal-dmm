2
0:00:12.564,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?

3
0:00:17.65,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Not very many of you.

4
0:00:19.59,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Okay. And actually of those hands,

5
0:00:21.586,000 --> 0:00:24,000
if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?

6
0:00:24.619,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So a couple.

7
0:00:26.076,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's okay.

8
0:00:26.979,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive --

9
0:00:29.454,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving.

10
0:00:32.325,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,

11
0:00:36.327,000 --> 0:00:38,000
whether you're eight or 80.

12
0:00:38.579,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,

13
0:00:41.303,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because you have to build a small, portable robot

14
0:00:44.036,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that's not only really affordable,

15
0:00:46.412,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but it has to be something

16
0:00:47.953,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.

17
0:00:51.94,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This robot can't be creepy or uncanny.

18
0:00:55.237,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He should be friendly and cute.

19
0:00:57.448,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So meet Romo.

20
0:01:00.359,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love --

21
0:01:04.216,000 --> 0:01:06,000
your iPhone -- as his brain.

22
0:01:07.065,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,

23
0:01:11.176,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled

24
0:01:15.627,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,

25
0:01:19.311,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.

26
0:01:24.243,000 --> 0:01:27,000
When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.

27
0:01:27.86,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.

28
0:01:32.977,000 --> 0:01:33,000
If I duck down, he'll follow me.

29
0:01:34.476,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.

30
0:01:36.802,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.

31
0:01:40.078,000 --> 0:01:44,000
If I come over here -- (Laughs)

32
0:01:44.279,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He's smart.

33
0:01:45.662,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And if I get too close to him,

34
0:01:47.876,000 --> 0:01:5,000
he gets scared just like any other creature.

35
0:01:51.009,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.

36
0:01:54.459,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Thanks, little guy.

37
0:01:56.352,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Sneezing sound)

38
0:01:57.734,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Bless you.

39
0:01:59.825,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired --

40
0:02:04.443,000 --> 0:02:06,000
if I want to explore the world with Romo,

41
0:02:06.458,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.

42
0:02:09.392,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So here's the iPad.

43
0:02:10.952,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.

44
0:02:13.693,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I can see everything that Romo sees,

45
0:02:15.326,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.

46
0:02:17.358,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now this is a free app on the App Store,

47
0:02:18.794,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so if any of you guys had this app on your phones,

48
0:02:20.516,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.

49
0:02:24.243,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I'll show you really quickly,

50
0:02:25.925,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Romo actually -- he's streaming video,

51
0:02:27.771,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so you can see me and the entire TED audience.

52
0:02:29.961,000 --> 0:02:3,000
If I get in front of Romo here.

53
0:02:31.493,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And if I want to control him, I can just drive.

54
0:02:34.534,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I can drive him around,

55
0:02:38.986,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I can take pictures of you.

56
0:02:40.912,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.

57
0:02:43.317,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So I'll snap a picture.

58
0:02:44.819,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad,

59
0:02:47.379,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.

60
0:02:50.969,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So there are all of you through Romo's eyes.

61
0:02:55.7,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And finally, because Romo is an extension of me,

62
0:02:58.786,000 --> 0:03:,000
I can express myself through his emotions.

63
0:03:00.804,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited.

64
0:03:06.07,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But the most important thing about Romo

65
0:03:07.453,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.

66
0:03:12.543,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.

67
0:03:15.127,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In fact, who would like to drive a robot?

68
0:03:18.095,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Okay. Awesome.

69
0:03:20.627,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Here you go.

70
0:03:22.261,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Thank you, Scott.

71
0:03:25.115,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And even cooler, you actually don't have to be

72
0:03:27.869,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.

73
0:03:32.276,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So he actually streams two-way audio and video

74
0:03:35.561,000 --> 0:03:36,000
between any two smart devices.

75
0:03:37.202,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So you can log in through the browser,

76
0:03:39.01,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.

77
0:03:40.494,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we were talking before about telepresence,

78
0:03:42.228,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and this is a really cool example.

79
0:03:43.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone,

80
0:03:47.977,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and her mom buys her a robot.

81
0:03:49.494,000 --> 0:03:51,000
That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot,

82
0:03:52.395,000 --> 0:03:54,000
send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.

83
0:03:55.024,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter

84
0:03:58.378,000 --> 0:04:,000
for fifteen minutes every single night,

85
0:04:00.702,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year.

86
0:04:04.013,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thanks, Scott.

87
0:04:05.545,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

88
0:04:11.229,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.

89
0:04:14.576,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.

90
0:04:18.536,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.

91
0:04:22.061,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.

92
0:04:25.429,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code

93
0:04:29.525,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and create any behavior for this robot you want.

94
0:04:31.704,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.

95
0:04:34.485,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser,

96
0:04:37.345,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is what you see Romo doing on the left.

97
0:04:39.315,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And then if you have something you like,

98
0:04:40.666,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life,

99
0:04:43.761,000 --> 0:04:44,000
run the program in real life.

100
0:04:45.245,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then if you have something you're proud of,

101
0:04:46.952,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.

102
0:04:50.493,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other.

103
0:04:53.619,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train

104
0:04:57.929,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.

105
0:05:02.518,000 --> 0:05:04,000
They change from person to person.

106
0:05:05.124,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home,

107
0:05:07.54,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.

108
0:05:11.691,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.

109
0:05:15.543,000 --> 0:05:17,000
To be honest, I have no idea.

110
0:05:18.027,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars

111
0:05:23.13,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or a large humanoid robot away.

112
0:05:26.457,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The future of personal robotics is happening today,

113
0:05:29.458,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo

114
0:05:33.041,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the creativity of people like yourselves.

115
0:05:36.036,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we can't wait to get you all robots,

116
0:05:38.218,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we can't wait to see what you build.

117
0:05:39.946,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:41.128,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Applause)

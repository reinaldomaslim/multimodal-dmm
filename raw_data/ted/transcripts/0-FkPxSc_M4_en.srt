1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm often asked

2
0:00:14.68,000 --> 0:00:16,000
why I do art,

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
what do I want to say with my art photography,

4
0:00:19.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and what is the use of it?

5
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Once in a while I start to worry

6
0:00:25.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
how to actually measure the impact from the art

7
0:00:29.72,000 --> 0:00:32,000
like we do with medicine or technology,

8
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where we can see the results and calculate it.

9
0:00:36.76,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Then I would finally be able to explain to my mother my art

10
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with real numbers.

11
0:00:44.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But my art is so far from metrics,

12
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and moreover, my photography is widely exposing the theme of escapism.

13
0:00:54.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
My theory is that all of us

14
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
struggle sometimes to escape

15
0:01:00.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in order to analyze our reality,

16
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
appreciate it or change.

17
0:01:06.8,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I don't work with daily life as it is,

18
0:01:09.92,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I'm not a documentary photographer

19
0:01:13.28,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the common sense.

20
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But I am a documentary photographer

21
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in a different sense.

22
0:01:20.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I document dreams.

23
0:01:23.6,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I work with daily life as it could be,

24
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as I imagine it.

25
0:01:28.2,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I am a daydreamer, but at the same time I love things that are authentic

26
0:01:34.36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and deal with our innermost nature,

27
0:01:37.8,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which I would never want to escape from.

28
0:01:40.92,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I adore complicated personalities,

29
0:01:43.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and real life inspires me to create my images.

30
0:01:48.48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Real life inspires our escape,

31
0:01:52.2,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and sometimes that escape is very needed.

32
0:01:57.24,000 --> 0:02:,000
I believe heroes are not created easily,

33
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I choose to work with individuals

34
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
who are survivors

35
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and facing everyday routines

36
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that are not always full of color,

37
0:02:11.04,000 --> 0:02:14,000
people who are on their way to a better life,

38
0:02:14.44,000 --> 0:02:17,000
fighting against life circumstances.

39
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Why do I choose people like that for my models?

40
0:02:21.919,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because I've been in that position myself,

41
0:02:24.6,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when I had to learn how to survive in real life.

42
0:02:28.84,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I was a student living abroad in London.

43
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was working at two places at the same time as a waitress.

44
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Obviously that wasn't my dream job,

45
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but I decided to play a game

46
0:02:42.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where I imagined that I am taking a role in a film,

47
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and in the film I am a waitress,

48
0:02:50.12,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I need to act great.

49
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I used to dye my hair and brows to gingerette,

50
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I changed my hair to curly perm,

51
0:02:59.28,000 --> 0:03:,000
I lost weight

52
0:03:00.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and made myself believe

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I am just a character acting in a film.

54
0:03:07.28,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That isn't forever,

55
0:03:08.56,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that is all just temporary.

56
0:03:11.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That helped me a lot.

57
0:03:12.84,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It motivated me to change my life

58
0:03:15.52,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and take a hard time as a game.

59
0:03:19.24,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now, as an artist,

60
0:03:21.96,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I am creating different lives for my models

61
0:03:24.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in order to give them the experience of being someone else in reality.

62
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Through the photographic process,

63
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:36,000
all of my models become like silent movie actors.

64
0:03:36.96,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They are captured at the moment

65
0:03:38.88,000 --> 0:03:42,000
when they believe in being someone else entirely.

66
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In order to create a new reality in its entirety,

67
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I physically create every single thing in my work,

68
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
sometimes from outfits to the stage.

69
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Because I work with analogues,

70
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I don't make any digital manipulations to my photographs,

71
0:03:59.72,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I need everything to take place in reality,

72
0:04:03.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in spite of the fact that nowadays,

73
0:04:06.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
digitally, you can create pretty much everything.

74
0:04:10.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I don't like this path.

75
0:04:12.28,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Even if that reaches perfection,

76
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I see the beauty in authenticity of making,

77
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and that's impossible without flaws.

78
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A digitally manipulated photograph

79
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is not true for me.

80
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It doesn't capture anything real.

81
0:04:28.72,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's not experienced, not motivating.

82
0:04:32.48,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's like, instead of going traveling,

83
0:04:34.84,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you look at someone else's travel photographs.

84
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What I find so exciting

85
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is the ability to make people's dreams of being someone else a reality.

86
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
That's like a drug

87
0:04:49.32,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which pushes me to keep working,

88
0:04:51.52,000 --> 0:04:52,000
even without metrics.

89
0:04:55.12,000 --> 0:04:56,000
One of my models

90
0:04:57.04,000 --> 0:05:01,000
had always dreamed of being seen as a warrior,

91
0:05:01.32,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but she wasn't able to do sports because of her health problems.

92
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Half a year ago, she passed away

93
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from heart disease at the age of 22.

94
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But two days before her death,

95
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the images we spent months working on together

96
0:05:19.6,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of her as a warrior she dreamed of becoming

97
0:05:23.76,000 --> 0:05:27,000
were published at a large exhibition in Milan by Vogue Magazine.

98
0:05:29.6,000 --> 0:05:31,000
All her life was about overcoming.

99
0:05:33.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Before she died, she had known

100
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that thousands of people saw her image from the land of escapism

101
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and believed in her as a brave and fearless warrior.

102
0:05:47.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
For my work, I invite people to play a game

103
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
like we all used to as children

104
0:05:53.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when we pretend to be someone else

105
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that process made us really happy.

106
0:05:59.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
To my mind it is important for grown-ups.

107
0:06:03.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We need these transformations

108
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to enact this in the name of art.

109
0:06:08.88,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It gives us the very real feeling of being important and powerful

110
0:06:14.36,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in order to influence our reality.

111
0:06:18.2,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I know this from my own personal experience.

112
0:06:22.08,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I have had so many versions of myself

113
0:06:25.64,000 --> 0:06:27,000
through my self-portraits

114
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that I've been many different characters.

115
0:06:33.04,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Being someone else in the land of escapism

116
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:4,000
doesn't exactly give us numbers that we can gauge,

117
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but it's like a real lost form of magic

118
0:06:44.68,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which exists but can't be measured.

119
0:06:47.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There is a unique power in art

120
0:06:50.36,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to transform and lift our limits.

121
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Art creates what I call a conjured life,

122
0:06:57.64,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which helps our existence

123
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and pushes, motivates and inspires us to dwell

124
0:07:04.8,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and express ourselves

125
0:07:07.36,000 --> 0:07:1,000
without metrics or calculations.

126
0:07:10.48,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Thank you.

127
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now

2
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is that all of the other speakers

3
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
have said exactly what I wanted to say.

4
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say

6
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is to thank you all for your kindness.

7
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
TD: But maybe in the spirit

8
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of appreciating the kindness of you all,

9
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I could share with you

10
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a little story about myself.

11
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
TD: From the time I was very young, onward,

12
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was given

13
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a lot of different responsibilities,

14
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and it always seemed to me, when I was young,

15
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that everything was laid out before me.

16
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
All of the plans for me were already made.

17
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear

18
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and told where I needed to be,

19
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
given these very precious

20
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and holy looking robes to wear,

21
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
with the understanding

22
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that it was something sacred or important.

23
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,

24
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.

25
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And when I was seven years old,

26
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
all of a sudden,

27
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a search party arrived at my home.

28
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They were looking the next Karmapa,

29
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,

30
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and the news came to me that they were telling me

31
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that I was the Karmapa.

32
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And these days, people ask me a lot,

33
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
how did that feel.

34
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,

35
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and your lifestyle completely changed?

36
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And what I mostly say is that,

37
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
at that time,

38
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it was a pretty interesting idea to me.

39
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I thought that things would be pretty fun

40
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and there would be more things to play with.

41
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

42
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,

43
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
as I thought it would have been.

44
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I was placed

45
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in a pretty strictly controlled environment.

46
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And immediately,

47
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
a lot of different responsibilities,

48
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.

49
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I was separated, largely, from my family,

50
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
including my mother and father.

51
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I didn't have have many personal friends

52
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to spend time with,

53
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but I was expected to perform

54
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
these prescribed duties.

55
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So it turned out that my fantasy

56
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa

57
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
wasn't going to come true.

58
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It more felt to be the case to me

59
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that I was being treated like a statue,

60
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I was to sit in one place

61
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
like a statue would.

62
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,

63
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
even though I've been separated from my loved ones --

64
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and, of course, now I'm even further away.

65
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet

66
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and became even further removed

67
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
from my mother and father,

68
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
my relatives, my friends

69
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and my homeland.

70
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But nevertheless,

71
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,

72
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
in terms of the love that I feel

73
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for these people.

74
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love

75
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for all of these people

76
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and for the land.

77
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
TD: And I still do

78
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
get to keep in touch with my mother and father,

79
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
albeit infrequently.

80
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I talk to my mother

81
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
once in a blue moon on the telephone.

82
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And my experience is that,

83
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
when I'm talking to her,

84
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with every second that passes

85
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
during our conversation,

86
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the feeling of love that binds us

87
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is bringing us closer and closer together.

88
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
TD: So those were just a few remarks

89
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
about my personal background.

90
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,

91
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in terms of ideas,

92
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,

93
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where so many people from different backgrounds and places

94
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
can come together,

95
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
exchange their ideas

96
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and form relationships of friendship with each other.

97
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I think that's symbolic

98
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of what we're seeing in the world in general,

99
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,

100
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and that all of the peoples in the world

101
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
are enjoying more opportunities for connection.

102
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's wonderful,

103
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but we should also remember

104
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.

105
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Along with outward development

106
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and increase of opportunity,

107
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
there should be inward development

108
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and deepening of our heart connections

109
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
as well as our outward connections.

110
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So we spoke and we heard some

111
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
about design this week.

112
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I think that it's important for us to remember

113
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that we need

114
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to keep pushing forward

115
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
on the endeavor

116
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of the design of the heart.

117
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We heard a lot about technology this week,

118
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and it's important for us to remember

119
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to invest a lot of our energy

120
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in improving the technology of the heart.

121
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy

122
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,

123
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
still, I feel a sense of impediment,

124
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
when it comes

125
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to the ability that we have

126
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.

127
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I feel that there are some things

128
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that are getting in the way.

129
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
TC: My relationship

130
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,

131
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is an interesting one,

132
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting

133
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to open my heart to others

134
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and offer myself up

135
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections

136
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
in a genuine way with other people,

137
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but at the same time,

138
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I've always been advised

139
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that I need to emphasize intelligence

140
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
over the heart-to-heart connections,

141
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because, being someone in a position like mine,

142
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,

143
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
then something dangerous may happen to me.

144
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So it's an interesting paradox at play there.

145
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But I had a really striking experience once,

146
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when a group from Afghanistan

147
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
came to visit me,

148
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and we had a really interesting conversation.

149
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,

150
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
which, as you know,

151
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.

152
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But the basis of our conversation

153
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
was the different approach to spirituality

154
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
on the part of the Muslim

155
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and Buddhist traditions.

156
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Of course, in Muslim,

157
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,

158
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
you don't find as many

159
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
physical representations of divinity

160
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
or of spiritual liberation

161
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as you do in the Buddhist tradition,

162
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha

163
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that are highly revered.

164
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So, we were talking about the differences

165
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
between the traditions

166
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and what many people perceived

167
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,

168
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
but I offered the suggestion

169
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.

170
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas

171
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
was the depletion of matter,

172
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
some solid substance

173
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
falling down and disintegrating.

174
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar

175
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to the falling of the Berlin Wall,

176
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
where a divide

177
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that had kept two types of people apart

178
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
had collapsed and opened up a door

179
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
for further communication.

180
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So I think that, in this way,

181
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's always possible for us

182
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to derive something positive

183
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that can help us understand one another better.

184
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
TD: So, with regard to the development

185
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that we've been talking about

186
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
here at this conference,

187
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I really feel

188
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that the development that we make

189
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
shouldn't create a further burden

190
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
for us as human beings,

191
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
but should be used

192
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
to improve

193
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
our fundamental lifestyle

194
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
of how we live in the world.

195
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
TD: Of course, I rejoice

196
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
in the development and the growth and the rise

197
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
of the noble land of India, the great country of India,

198
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
but at the same time, I think,

199
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
as some of us have acknowledged,

200
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
we need to be aware

201
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
that some aspects of this rise

202
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
are coming at the cost

203
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
of the very ground

204
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
on which we stand.

205
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
So, as we are climbing the tree,

206
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
some of the things that we're doing

207
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
in order to climb the tree

208
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
are actually undermining

209
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
the tree's very root.

210
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And so,

211
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
what I think it comes down to

212
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,

213
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
but paying attention to that

214
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and letting that shift our motivation

215
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
to become more sincere

216
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and genuinely positive.

217
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
We have hear, this week,

218
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
about the horrible sufferings, for example,

219
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
that so many women of the world

220
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
are enduring day-to-day.

221
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
We have that information,

222
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
but what often happens to us

223
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.

224
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
We don't really choose to allow that

225
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.

226
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
So I think the way forward for the world --

227
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
one that will bring the path of outer development

228
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
in harmony

229
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
with the real root of happiness --

230
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
is that we allow

231
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
the information that we have

232
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
to really make a change in our heart.

233
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
TD: So I think that sincere motivation

234
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
is very important for our future well-being,

235
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
or deep sense of well-being as humans,

236
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:56,000
and I think that means sinking in

237
0:20:56.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
to whatever it is you're doing now.

238
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,

239
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:02,000
sink into that,

240
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
get a full taste of that.

241
0:21:40.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
TD: So, since we've been here this week,

242
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:46,000
we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,

243
0:21:47.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
and perhaps we haven't witnessed

244
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:51,000
any course changes

245
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
happening in our lives,

246
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:56,000
but we often miss the very subtle changes.

247
0:21:56.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
And I think

248
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:01,000
that sometimes we develop

249
0:22:01.26,000 --> 0:22:03,000
grand concepts

250
0:22:03.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
of what happiness

251
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:07,000
might look like for us,

252
0:22:07.26,000 --> 0:22:09,000
but that, if we pay attention,

253
0:22:09.26,000 --> 0:22:12,000
we can see that there are little symbols of happiness

254
0:22:12.26,000 --> 0:22:14,000
in every breath that we take.

255
0:23:21.26,000 --> 0:23:24,000
TD: So, every one of you who has come here

256
0:23:24.26,000 --> 0:23:26,000
is so talented,

257
0:23:26.26,000 --> 0:23:29,000
and you have so much to offer to the world,

258
0:23:30.26,000 --> 0:23:34,000
I think it would be a good note to conclude on then

259
0:23:34.26,000 --> 0:23:37,000
to just take a moment

260
0:23:37.26,000 --> 0:23:39,000
to appreciate how fortunate we are

261
0:23:39.26,000 --> 0:23:42,000
to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas

262
0:23:42.26,000 --> 0:23:44,000
and really form a strong aspiration

263
0:23:44.26,000 --> 0:23:46,000
and energy within ourselves

264
0:23:46.26,000 --> 0:23:48,000
that we will take the good

265
0:23:48.26,000 --> 0:23:5,000
that has come from this conference,

266
0:23:50.26,000 --> 0:23:53,000
the momentum, the positivity,

267
0:23:53.26,000 --> 0:23:55,000
and we will spread that and plant it

268
0:23:55.26,000 --> 0:23:58,000
in all of the corners of the world.

269
0:24:18.26,000 --> 0:24:21,000
His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.

270
0:24:32.26,000 --> 0:24:35,000
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,

271
0:24:35.26,000 --> 0:24:37,000
even in inviting me,

272
0:24:37.26,000 --> 0:24:39,000
let alone everything else that she has done

273
0:24:39.26,000 --> 0:24:41,000
to make this happen,

274
0:24:41.26,000 --> 0:24:44,000
and I was somewhat resistant at times,

275
0:24:44.26,000 --> 0:24:47,000
and I was also very nervous throughout this week.

276
0:24:47.26,000 --> 0:24:5,000
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,

277
0:24:50.26,000 --> 0:24:52,000
and people would ask me, why.

278
0:24:52.26,000 --> 0:24:55,000
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."

279
0:24:57.26,000 --> 0:25:,000
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,

280
0:25:00.26,000 --> 0:25:02,000
but I very much appreciate

281
0:25:02.26,000 --> 0:25:04,000
the opportunity she's given me

282
0:25:04.26,000 --> 0:25:06,000
to be here.

283
0:25:06.26,000 --> 0:25:09,000
And to you, everyone, thank you very much.

284
0:25:09.26,000 --> 0:25:12,000
(Applause)

285
0:25:12.26,000 --> 0:25:14,000
HH: Thank you very much.

286
0:25:14.26,000 --> 0:25:17,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.231,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So yesterday, I was out in the street

2
0:00:14.611,000 --> 0:00:16,000
in front of this building,

3
0:00:17.287,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I was walking down the sidewalk,

4
0:00:20.323,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I had company, several of us,

5
0:00:22.183,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and we were all abiding by the rules

6
0:00:23.681,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of walking down sidewalks.

7
0:00:26.068,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.

8
0:00:28.51,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We're moving.

9
0:00:29.933,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When the person in front of me slows down.

10
0:00:33.196,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,

11
0:00:35.186,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and finally he stops.

12
0:00:36.783,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,

13
0:00:38.868,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,

14
0:00:42.547,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,

15
0:00:45.28,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and he was doing this.

16
0:00:47.848,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He was texting,

17
0:00:49.792,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.

18
0:00:51.814,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now we could approach this

19
0:00:53.623,000 --> 0:00:54,000
from a working memory perspective

20
0:00:55.515,000 --> 0:00:56,000
or from a multitasking perspective.

21
0:00:57.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We're going to do working memory today.

22
0:01:00.029,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, working memory

23
0:01:02.169,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is that part of our consciousness that we are

24
0:01:05.317,000 --> 0:01:07,000
aware of at any given time of day.

25
0:01:07.771,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You're going it right now.

26
0:01:09.413,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's not something we can turn off.

27
0:01:11.067,000 --> 0:01:14,000
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?

28
0:01:14.518,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So right now, you're doing just fine.

29
0:01:17.621,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now working memory has four basic components.

30
0:01:19.977,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It allows us to store some immediate experiences

31
0:01:22.574,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and a little bit of knowledge.

32
0:01:24.19,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory

33
0:01:27.559,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and pull some of that in as we need it,

34
0:01:29.409,000 --> 0:01:31,000
mixes it, processes it

35
0:01:31.609,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in light of whatever our current goal is.

36
0:01:33.903,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now the current goal isn't something like,

37
0:01:35.417,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.

38
0:01:37.699,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,

39
0:01:40.502,000 --> 0:01:42,000
or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.

40
0:01:43.104,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now working memory capacity

41
0:01:45.284,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is our ability to leverage that,

42
0:01:47.89,000 --> 0:01:49,000
our ability to take what we know

43
0:01:50.685,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and what we can hang onto

44
0:01:51.961,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy

45
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
our current goal.

46
0:01:57.31,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now working memory capacity

47
0:01:59.094,000 --> 0:02:01,000
has a fairly long history,

48
0:02:01.147,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.

49
0:02:03.346,000 --> 0:02:05,000
People with high working memory capacity

50
0:02:05.734,000 --> 0:02:07,000
tend to be good storytellers.

51
0:02:07.978,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests,

52
0:02:11.955,000 --> 0:02:13,000
however important that is.

53
0:02:14.3,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They're able to have high levels of writing ability.

54
0:02:18.083,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They're also able to reason at high levels.

55
0:02:20.957,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that.

56
0:02:23.875,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,

57
0:02:26.425,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and we're going to take your working memory out for a ride.

58
0:02:29.504,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You up for that? Okay.

59
0:02:32.101,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'm going to give you five words,

60
0:02:34.299,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I just want you to hang on to them.

61
0:02:36.092,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.

62
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Five words.

63
0:02:39.372,000 --> 0:02:42,000
While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.

64
0:02:42.575,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I want to see what happens with those words.

65
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So here's the words:

66
0:02:46.327,000 --> 0:02:49,000
tree,

67
0:02:49.615,000 --> 0:02:51,000
highway,

68
0:02:52.55,000 --> 0:02:54,000
mirror,

69
0:02:54.928,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Saturn

70
0:02:57.06,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and electrode.

71
0:02:59.479,000 --> 0:03:,000
So far so good?

72
0:03:01.063,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Okay. What I want you to do

73
0:03:02.917,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is I want you to tell me what the answer is

74
0:03:06.264,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to 23 times eight.

75
0:03:08.586,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Just shout it out.

76
0:03:12.766,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Mumbling) (Laughter)

77
0:03:16.468,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter)

78
0:03:18.889,000 --> 0:03:21,000
All right. I want you to take out your left hand

79
0:03:22.116,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,

80
0:03:24.796,000 --> 0:03:26,000
six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

81
0:03:26.999,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering.

82
0:03:29.695,000 --> 0:03:3,000
All right, now what I want you to do

83
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is to recite the last five letters

84
0:03:33.785,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of the English alphabet backwards.

85
0:03:38.637,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You should have started with Z.

86
0:03:40.539,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:43.83,000 --> 0:03:45,000
All right. How many people here are still pretty sure

88
0:03:45.917,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you've got all five words?

89
0:03:48.368,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,

90
0:03:51.549,000 --> 0:03:53,000
right, which is normal. There will be a range.

91
0:03:53.624,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Some people can hang on to five.

92
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Some people can hang on to 10.

93
0:03:56.464,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Some will be down to two or three.

94
0:03:58.769,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right?

95
0:04:02.173,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And it's going to be really important here at TED

96
0:04:04.121,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.

97
0:04:07.157,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now the problem that we have

98
0:04:09.364,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is that life comes at us,

99
0:04:11.076,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and it comes at us very quickly,

100
0:04:13.193,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and what we need to do is to take that amorphous

101
0:04:17.106,000 --> 0:04:18,000
flow of experience and somehow

102
0:04:18.884,000 --> 0:04:19,000
extract meaning from it

103
0:04:20.391,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with a working memory

104
0:04:21.69,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that's about the size of a pea.

105
0:04:23.959,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome.

106
0:04:26.506,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Working memory allows us

107
0:04:28.621,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to investigate our current experience

108
0:04:30.993,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as we move forward.

109
0:04:32.488,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It allows us to make sense of the world around us.

110
0:04:35.656,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But it does have certain limits.

111
0:04:37.575,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.

112
0:04:41.418,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We can have a conversation,

113
0:04:42.89,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I can build a narrative around that

114
0:04:45.577,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so I know where we've been and where we're going

115
0:04:47.307,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and how to contribute to this conversation.

116
0:04:49.395,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.

117
0:04:51.632,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We can be in the middle of a meeting,

118
0:04:53.436,000 --> 0:04:55,000
listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,

119
0:04:55.939,000 --> 0:04:56,000
decide whether or not we like it,

120
0:04:57.581,000 --> 0:04:58,000
ask follow-up questions.

121
0:04:58.839,000 --> 0:05:01,000
All of that occurs within working memory.

122
0:05:02.209,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It also allows us to go to the store

123
0:05:04.056,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese

124
0:05:07.71,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when what we're really looking for

125
0:05:09.481,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)

126
0:05:12.318,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.

127
0:05:15.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, a central issue with working memory

128
0:05:18.377,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is that it's limited.

129
0:05:19.774,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,

130
0:05:21.97,000 --> 0:05:22,000
limited in focus.

131
0:05:23.58,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We tend to remember about four things.

132
0:05:26.315,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Okay? It used to be seven,

133
0:05:28.212,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,

134
0:05:30.236,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we were overachieving.

135
0:05:32.779,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now we can remember those four things

136
0:05:34.752,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for about 10 to 20 seconds

137
0:05:36.615,000 --> 0:05:37,000
unless we do something with it,

138
0:05:38.342,000 --> 0:05:4,000
unless we process it, unless we apply it to something,

139
0:05:40.855,000 --> 0:05:43,000
unless we talk to somebody about it.

140
0:05:44.5,000 --> 0:05:47,000
When we think about working memory,

141
0:05:47.742,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we have to realize that this limited capacity

142
0:05:51.046,000 --> 0:05:53,000
has lots of different impacts on us.

143
0:05:53.541,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Have you ever walked from one room to another

144
0:05:56.566,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and then forgotten why you're there?

145
0:05:59.577,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You do know the solution to that, right?

146
0:06:01.746,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You go back to that original room. (Laughter)

147
0:06:04.092,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Have you ever forgotten your keys?

148
0:06:08.029,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You ever forgotten your car?

149
0:06:10.558,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You ever forgotten your kids?

150
0:06:13.529,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Have you ever been involved in a conversation,

151
0:06:15.718,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you realize that the conversation to your left

152
0:06:17.662,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is actually more interesting? (Laughter)

153
0:06:20.496,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So you're nodding and you're smiling,

154
0:06:22.12,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but you're really paying attention to this one over here,

155
0:06:24.508,000 --> 0:06:26,000
until you hear that last word go up,

156
0:06:26.808,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you realize,

157
0:06:28.468,000 --> 0:06:3,000
you've been asked a question. (Laughter)

158
0:06:31.422,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And you're really hoping the answer is no,

159
0:06:33.369,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because that's what you're about to say.

160
0:06:36.588,000 --> 0:06:38,000
All of that talks about working memory,

161
0:06:39.064,000 --> 0:06:41,000
what we can do and what we can't do.

162
0:06:41.322,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We need to realize that working memory

163
0:06:42.859,000 --> 0:06:43,000
has a limited capacity,

164
0:06:44.258,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that.

165
0:06:47.777,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We negotiate that through strategies.

166
0:06:49.948,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here,

167
0:06:52.269,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and these will be really important

168
0:06:53.544,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because you are now in an information target-rich environment

169
0:06:57.299,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for the next several days.

170
0:06:59.419,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now the first part of this that we need to think about

171
0:07:02.323,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and we need to process our existence, our life,

172
0:07:05.09,000 --> 0:07:06,000
immediately and repeatedly.

173
0:07:06.805,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We need to process what's going on

174
0:07:09.246,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,

175
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
not a week later, at the moment.

176
0:07:14.429,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him?

177
0:07:18.162,000 --> 0:07:2,000
What's missing? What would I like to know?

178
0:07:20.942,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Do I agree with the assumptions?

179
0:07:23.164,000 --> 0:07:24,000
How can I apply this in my life?

180
0:07:24.974,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's a way of processing what's going on

181
0:07:26.954,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so that we can use it later.

182
0:07:28.721,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.

183
0:07:31.681,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So we need to think about it here.

184
0:07:34.093,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In between, we want to talk to people about it.

185
0:07:36.888,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We're going to write it down, and when you get home,

186
0:07:39.111,000 --> 0:07:4,000
pull out those notes and think about them

187
0:07:41.071,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and end up practicing over time.

188
0:07:43.46,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing.

189
0:07:46.011,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's very positive.

190
0:07:47.463,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively

191
0:07:50.513,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and we need to think illustratively.

192
0:07:52.853,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge.

193
0:07:56.307,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What we want to do is spin that around.

194
0:07:58.237,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We want to take all of our existence

195
0:07:59.994,000 --> 0:08:,000
and wrap it around that new knowledge

196
0:08:01.747,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful.

197
0:08:05.195,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We also want to use imagery. We are built for images.

198
0:08:08.989,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We need to take advantage of that.

199
0:08:10.847,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Think about things in images,

200
0:08:12.357,000 --> 0:08:14,000
write things down that way.

201
0:08:14.706,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If you read a book, pull things up.

202
0:08:16.268,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"

203
0:08:18.321,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like

204
0:08:21.42,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in my head, so my own version.

205
0:08:24.418,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The last one is organization and support.

206
0:08:26.421,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.

207
0:08:28.99,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us.

208
0:08:32.131,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Organization helps, so we need to structure

209
0:08:34.421,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what we're doing in ways that make sense.

210
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
If we are providing knowledge and experience,

211
0:08:38.586,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we need to structure that.

212
0:08:40.071,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And the last one is support.

213
0:08:42.57,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We all started as novices.

214
0:08:44.292,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication.

215
0:08:47.333,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that.

216
0:08:50.27,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The support may come in asking people questions,

217
0:08:52.926,000 --> 0:08:55,000
giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it

218
0:08:56.429,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or has some guiding images,

219
0:08:58.977,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but we need to support it.

220
0:09:00.877,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message

221
0:09:06.168,000 --> 0:09:08,000
from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:

222
0:09:09.094,000 --> 0:09:11,000
what we process, we learn.

223
0:09:12.025,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If we're not processing life, we're not living it.

224
0:09:16.826,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Live life. Thank you.

225
0:09:18.718,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Applause)

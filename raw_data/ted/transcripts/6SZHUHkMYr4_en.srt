1
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to talk to you about something important that may be new to you.

2
0:00:17.259,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The governments of the world

3
0:00:18.669,000 --> 0:00:2,000
are about to conduct an unintentional experiment

4
0:00:20.957,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on our climate.

5
0:00:22.736,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In 2020, new rules will require ships to lower their sulfur emissions

6
0:00:28.07,000 --> 0:00:3,000
by scrubbing their dirty exhaust

7
0:00:30.202,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or switching to cleaner fuels.

8
0:00:32.705,000 --> 0:00:34,000
For human health, this is really good,

9
0:00:35.362,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but sulfur particles in the emission of ships

10
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:39,000
also have an effect on clouds.

11
0:00:40.981,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is a satellite image of marine clouds

12
0:00:43.506,000 --> 0:00:45,000
off the Pacific West Coast of the United States.

13
0:00:46.482,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The streaks in the clouds are created by the exhaust from ships.

14
0:00:50.139,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Ships' emissions include both greenhouse gases,

15
0:00:53.037,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which trap heat over long periods of time,

16
0:00:55.896,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and particulates like sulfates that mix with clouds

17
0:00:59.135,000 --> 0:01:,000
and temporarily make them brighter.

18
0:01:01.672,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Brighter clouds reflect more sunlight back to space,

19
0:01:04.987,000 --> 0:01:05,000
cooling the climate.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So in fact,

21
0:01:08.666,000 --> 0:01:1,000
humans are currently running two unintentional experiments

22
0:01:11.603,000 --> 0:01:12,000
on our climate.

23
0:01:13.188,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In the first one, we're increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases

24
0:01:17.254,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and gradually warming the earth system.

25
0:01:19.712,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This works something like a fever in the human body.

26
0:01:23.172,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If the fever remains low, its effects are mild,

27
0:01:26.582,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but as the fever rises, damage grows more severe

28
0:01:29.48,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and eventually devastating.

29
0:01:31.748,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We're seeing a little of this now.

30
0:01:34.739,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In our other experiment,

31
0:01:35.986,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we're planning to remove a layer of particles

32
0:01:38.63,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that brighten clouds and shield us from some of this warming.

33
0:01:42.306,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The effect is strongest in ocean clouds like these,

34
0:01:45.536,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and scientists expect the reduction of sulfur emissions from ships next year

35
0:01:51.029,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to produce a measurable increase in global warming.

36
0:01:55.592,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Bit of a shocker?

37
0:01:57.687,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In fact, most emissions contain sulfates that brighten clouds:

38
0:02:01.901,000 --> 0:02:04,000
coal, diesel exhaust, forest fires.

39
0:02:06.149,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Scientists estimate that the total cooling effect from emission particles,

40
0:02:09.872,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which they call aerosols when they're in the climate,

41
0:02:13.156,000 --> 0:02:17,000
may be as much as all of the warming we've experienced up until now.

42
0:02:17.748,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There's a lot of uncertainty around this effect,

43
0:02:20.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it's one of the major reasons why we have difficulty predicting climate,

44
0:02:25.13,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but this is cooling that we'll lose as emissions fall.

45
0:02:29.968,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So to be clear, humans are currently cooling the planet

46
0:02:34.896,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by dispersing particles into the atmosphere at massive scale.

47
0:02:38.641,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We just don't know how much, and we're doing it accidentally.

48
0:02:42.585,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That's worrying,

49
0:02:44.553,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but it could mean that we have a fast-acting way to reduce warming,

50
0:02:47.995,000 --> 0:02:5,000
emergency medicine for our climate fever if we needed it,

51
0:02:51.634,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and it's a medicine with origins in nature.

52
0:02:56.272,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is a NASA simulation of earth's atmosphere,

53
0:02:59.14,000 --> 0:03:01,000
showing clouds and particles moving over the planet.

54
0:03:02.454,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The brightness is the Sun's light reflecting from particles in clouds,

55
0:03:06.947,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and this reflective shield is one of the primary ways

56
0:03:10.694,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that nature keeps the planet cool enough for humans

57
0:03:13.1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and all of the life that we know.

58
0:03:15.665,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In 2015, scientists assessed possibilities for rapidly cooling climate.

59
0:03:21.002,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They discounted things like mirrors in space,

60
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
ping-pong balls in the ocean, plastic sheets on the Arctic,

61
0:03:29.125,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and they found that the most viable approaches

62
0:03:31.523,000 --> 0:03:35,000
involved slightly increasing this atmospheric reflectivity.

63
0:03:36.406,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In fact, it's possible that reflecting just one or two percent more sunlight

64
0:03:40.79,000 --> 0:03:41,000
from the atmosphere

65
0:03:42.767,000 --> 0:03:45,000
could offset two degrees Celsius or more of warming.

66
0:03:47.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, I'm a technology executive, not a scientist.

67
0:03:51.259,000 --> 0:03:53,000
About a decade ago, concerned about climate,

68
0:03:54.092,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I started to talk with scientists about potential countermeasures to warming.

69
0:03:58.987,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These conversations grew into collaborations

70
0:04:02.027,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that became the Marine Cloud Brightening Project,

71
0:04:04.375,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which I'll talk about momentarily,

72
0:04:06.681,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the nonprofit policy organization SilverLining, where I am today.

73
0:04:11.483,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I work with politicians, researchers,

74
0:04:15.094,000 --> 0:04:16,000
members of the tech industry and others

75
0:04:17.094,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to talk about some of these ideas.

76
0:04:20.039,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Early on, I met British atmospheric scientist John Latham,

77
0:04:23.308,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who proposed cooling the climate the way that the ships do,

78
0:04:26.339,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but with a natural source of particles:

79
0:04:28.678,000 --> 0:04:3,000
sea-salt mist from seawater

80
0:04:31.34,000 --> 0:04:34,000
sprayed from ships into areas of susceptible clouds over the ocean.

81
0:04:35.366,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The approach became known by the name I gave it then,

82
0:04:38.253,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"marine cloud brightening."

83
0:04:39.844,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Early modeling studies suggested that by deploying marine cloud brightening

84
0:04:44.326,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in just 10 to 20 percent of susceptible ocean clouds,

85
0:04:47.938,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it might be possible to offset as much as two degrees Celsius's warming.

86
0:04:53.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It might even be possible to brighten clouds in local regions

87
0:04:56.153,000 --> 0:05:,000
to reduce the impacts caused by warming ocean surface temperatures.

88
0:05:00.762,000 --> 0:05:02,000
For example, regions such as the Gulf Atlantic

89
0:05:03.598,000 --> 0:05:05,000
might be cooled in the months before a hurricane season

90
0:05:06.242,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to reduce the force of storms.

91
0:05:08.607,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Or, it might be possible to cool waters flowing onto coral reefs

92
0:05:12.554,000 --> 0:05:13,000
overwhelmed by heat stress,

93
0:05:14.182,000 --> 0:05:16,000
like Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

94
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But these ideas are only theoretical,

95
0:05:19.03,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and brightening marine clouds is not the only way

96
0:05:22.182,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to increase the reflection of the sunlight from the atmosphere.

97
0:05:26.063,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Another occurs when large volcanoes release material with enough force

98
0:05:31.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to reach the upper layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere.

99
0:05:34.705,000 --> 0:05:37,000
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991,

100
0:05:38.008,000 --> 0:05:4,000
it released material into the stratosphere,

101
0:05:40.032,000 --> 0:05:44,000
including sulfates that mix with the atmosphere to reflect sunlight.

102
0:05:45.309,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This material remained and circulated around the planet.

103
0:05:48.996,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It was enough to cool the climate by over half a degree Celsius

104
0:05:52.992,000 --> 0:05:53,000
for about two years.

105
0:05:56.011,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This cooling led to a striking increase in Arctic ice cover in 1992,

106
0:06:02.051,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which dropped in subsequent years as the particles fell back to earth.

107
0:06:06.349,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But the volcanic phenomenon led Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen

108
0:06:10.191,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to propose the idea that dispersing particles into the stratosphere

109
0:06:13.516,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in a controlled way might be a way to counter global warming.

110
0:06:17.96,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, this has risks that we don't understand,

111
0:06:20.906,000 --> 0:06:22,000
including things like heating up the stratosphere

112
0:06:23.66,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or damage to the ozone layer.

113
0:06:25.715,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Scientists think that there could be safe approaches to this,

114
0:06:30.255,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but is this really where we are?

115
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Is this really worth considering?

116
0:06:35.494,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is a simulation

117
0:06:36.803,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from the US National Center for Atmospheric Research

118
0:06:39.431,000 --> 0:06:43,000
global climate model showing, earth surface temperatures through 2100.

119
0:06:43.89,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The globe on the left visualizes our current trajectory,

120
0:06:47.907,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and on the right, a world where particles are introduced into the stratosphere

121
0:06:51.599,000 --> 0:06:52,000
gradually in 2020,

122
0:06:53.018,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and maintained through 2100.

123
0:06:55.66,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Intervention keeps surface temperatures near those of today,

124
0:06:59.97,000 --> 0:07:03,000
while without it, temperatures rise well over three degrees.

125
0:07:04.245,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This could be the difference between a safe and an unsafe world.

126
0:07:09.854,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, if there's even a chance that this could be close to reality,

127
0:07:13.742,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is this something we should consider seriously?

128
0:07:18.234,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Today, there are no capabilities,

129
0:07:19.989,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and scientific knowledge is extremely limited.

130
0:07:23.342,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We don't know whether these types of interventions are even feasible,

131
0:07:27.912,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or how to characterize their risks.

132
0:07:30.761,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Researchers hope to explore some basic questions

133
0:07:33.912,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that might help us know whether or not these might be real options

134
0:07:38.095,000 --> 0:07:39,000
or whether we should rule them out.

135
0:07:40.689,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It requires multiple ways of studying the climate system,

136
0:07:44.133,000 --> 0:07:47,000
including computer models to forecast changes,

137
0:07:47.269,000 --> 0:07:49,000
analytic techniques like machine learning,

138
0:07:49.572,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and many types of observations.

139
0:07:52.595,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And though it's controversial,

140
0:07:54.404,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it's also critical that researchers develop core technologies

141
0:07:58.564,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and perform small-scale, real-world experiments.

142
0:08:03.186,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There are two research programs proposing experiments like this.

143
0:08:07.408,000 --> 0:08:11,000
At Harvard, the SCoPEx experiment would release very small amounts

144
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of sulfates, calcium carbonate and water into the stratosphere with a balloon,

145
0:08:17.02,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to study chemistry and physics effects.

146
0:08:20.956,000 --> 0:08:21,000
How much material?

147
0:08:22.867,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Less than the amount released in one minute of flight

148
0:08:25.576,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from a commercial aircraft.

149
0:08:27.654,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So this is definitely not dangerous,

150
0:08:30.336,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and it may not even be scary.

151
0:08:33.114,000 --> 0:08:35,000
At the University of Washington,

152
0:08:35.203,000 --> 0:08:39,000
scientists hope to spray a fine mist of salt water into clouds

153
0:08:39.361,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in a series of land and ocean tests.

154
0:08:41.969,000 --> 0:08:43,000
If those are successful, this would culminate in experiments

155
0:08:44.804,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to measurably brighten an area of clouds over the ocean.

156
0:08:48.738,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The marine cloud brightening effort is the first to develop any technology

157
0:08:52.69,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for generating aerosols for atmospheric sunlight reflection in this way.

158
0:08:57.166,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It requires producing very tiny particles --

159
0:08:59.977,000 --> 0:09:03,000
think about the mist that comes out of an asthma inhaler --

160
0:09:04.469,000 --> 0:09:07,000
at massive scale -- so think of looking up at a cloud.

161
0:09:08.5,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's a tricky engineering problem.

162
0:09:11.42,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So this one nozzle they developed

163
0:09:13.056,000 --> 0:09:15,000
generates three trillion particles per second,

164
0:09:15.722,000 --> 0:09:17,000
80 nanometers in size,

165
0:09:17.764,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from very corrosive saltwater.

166
0:09:20.681,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It was developed by a team of retired engineers in Silicon Valley --

167
0:09:24.317,000 --> 0:09:25,000
here they are --

168
0:09:25.883,000 --> 0:09:3,000
working full-time for six years, without pay, for their grandchildren.

169
0:09:31.334,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It will take a few million dollars and another year or two

170
0:09:34.246,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to develop the full spray system they need to do these experiments.

171
0:09:38.754,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In other parts of the world, research efforts are emerging,

172
0:09:42.377,000 --> 0:09:46,000
including small modeling programs at Beijing Normal University in China,

173
0:09:46.734,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the Indian Institute of Science,

174
0:09:49.087,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a proposed center for climate repair at Cambridge University in the UK

175
0:09:53.802,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and the DECIMALS Fund,

176
0:09:56.031,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which sponsors researchers in global South countries

177
0:09:58.754,000 --> 0:10:,000
to study the potential impacts of these sunlight interventions

178
0:10:01.739,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in their part of the world.

179
0:10:03.946,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But all of these programs, including the experimental ones,

180
0:10:08.072,000 --> 0:10:09,000
lack significant funding.

181
0:10:10.601,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And understanding these interventions is a hard problem.

182
0:10:13.536,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The earth is a vast, complex system

183
0:10:15.982,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and we need major investments in climate models, observations

184
0:10:18.925,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and basic science

185
0:10:20.498,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to be able to predict climate much better than we can today

186
0:10:24.339,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and manage both our accidental and any intentional interventions.

187
0:10:29.521,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And it could be urgent.

188
0:10:32.107,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Recent scientific reports predict that in the next few decades,

189
0:10:36.128,000 --> 0:10:38,000
earth's fever is on a path to devastation:

190
0:10:38.956,000 --> 0:10:39,000
extreme heat and fires,

191
0:10:41.875,000 --> 0:10:43,000
major loss of ocean life,

192
0:10:44.812,000 --> 0:10:45,000
collapse of Arctic ice,

193
0:10:47.779,000 --> 0:10:5,000
displacement and suffering for hundreds of millions of people.

194
0:10:52.277,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The fever could even reach tipping points where warming takes over

195
0:10:56.001,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and human efforts are no longer enough

196
0:10:58.262,000 --> 0:11:,000
to counter accelerating changes in natural systems.

197
0:11:01.848,000 --> 0:11:03,000
To prevent this circumstance,

198
0:11:04.139,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the UN's International Panel on Climate Change predicts

199
0:11:06.807,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that we need to stop and even reverse emissions by 2050.

200
0:11:11.108,000 --> 0:11:15,000
How? We have to quickly and radically transform major economic sectors,

201
0:11:15.865,000 --> 0:11:19,000
including energy, construction, agriculture, transportation and others.

202
0:11:20.898,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And it is imperative that we do this as fast as we can.

203
0:11:25.427,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But our fever is now so high

204
0:11:27.484,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that climate experts say we also have to remove

205
0:11:29.716,000 --> 0:11:31,000
massive quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere,

206
0:11:32.692,000 --> 0:11:35,000
possibly 10 times all of the world's annual emissions,

207
0:11:36.319,000 --> 0:11:37,000
in ways that aren't proven yet.

208
0:11:39.031,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Right now, we have slow-moving solutions to a fast-moving problem.

209
0:11:44.015,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Even with the most optimistic assumptions,

210
0:11:46.15,000 --> 0:11:49,000
our exposure to risk in the next 10 to 30 years

211
0:11:49.452,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is unacceptably high, in my opinion.

212
0:11:52.809,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Could interventions like these provide fast-acting medicine if we need it

213
0:11:56.516,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to reduce the earth's fever while we address its underlying causes?

214
0:12:00.621,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There are real concerns about this idea.

215
0:12:03.246,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Some people are very worried that even researching these interventions

216
0:12:06.634,000 --> 0:12:1,000
could provide an excuse to delay efforts to reduce emissions.

217
0:12:10.81,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is also known as a moral hazard.

218
0:12:14.013,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But, like most medicines,

219
0:12:15.918,000 --> 0:12:18,000
interventions are more dangerous the more that you do,

220
0:12:19.199,000 --> 0:12:21,000
so research actually tends to draw out the fact

221
0:12:21.716,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that we absolutely, positively cannot continue

222
0:12:24.81,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to fill up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases,

223
0:12:27.655,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that these kinds of alternatives are risky

224
0:12:30.156,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and if we were to use them,

225
0:12:32.551,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we would need to use as little as possible.

226
0:12:36.746,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But even so,

227
0:12:38.701,000 --> 0:12:4,000
could we ever learn enough about these interventions

228
0:12:41.429,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to manage the risk?

229
0:12:43.444,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Who would make decisions about when and how to intervene?

230
0:12:47.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
What if some people are worse off,

231
0:12:50.273,000 --> 0:12:51,000
or they just think they are?

232
0:12:52.537,000 --> 0:12:53,000
These are really hard problems.

233
0:12:55.506,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But what really worries me is that as climate impacts worsen,

234
0:13:00.512,000 --> 0:13:03,000
leaders will be called on to respond by any means available.

235
0:13:04.836,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I for one don't want them to act without real information

236
0:13:08.042,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and much better options.

237
0:13:10.758,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Scientists think it will take a decade of research

238
0:13:13.116,000 --> 0:13:15,000
just to assess these interventions,

239
0:13:15.289,000 --> 0:13:17,000
before we ever were to develop or use them.

240
0:13:18.392,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Yet today, the global level of investment in these interventions

241
0:13:22.82,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is effectively zero.

242
0:13:26.061,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So, we need to move quickly

243
0:13:28.816,000 --> 0:13:31,000
if we want policymakers to have real information

244
0:13:32.062,000 --> 0:13:33,000
on this kind of emergency medicine.

245
0:13:36.169,000 --> 0:13:37,000
There is hope!

246
0:13:38.621,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The world has solved these kinds of problems before.

247
0:13:41.562,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In the 1970s, we identified an existential threat

248
0:13:44.99,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to our protective ozone layer.

249
0:13:47.664,000 --> 0:13:49,000
In the 1980s, scientists, politicians and industry

250
0:13:50.522,000 --> 0:13:53,000
came together in a solution to replace the chemicals causing the problem.

251
0:13:54.937,000 --> 0:13:57,000
They achieved this with the only legally binding environmental agreement

252
0:13:58.474,000 --> 0:14:,000
signed by all countries in the world,

253
0:14:00.678,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the Montreal Protocol.

254
0:14:02.642,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Still in force today,

255
0:14:04.676,000 --> 0:14:06,000
it has resulted in a recovery of the ozone layer

256
0:14:07.484,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and is the most successful environmental protection effort

257
0:14:10.45,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in human history.

258
0:14:13.104,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We have a far greater threat now,

259
0:14:15.723,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but we do have the ability to develop and agree on solutions

260
0:14:19.977,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to protect people

261
0:14:21.54,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and restore our climate to health.

262
0:14:24.406,000 --> 0:14:26,000
This could mean that to remain safe,

263
0:14:27.2,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we reflect sunlight for a few decades,

264
0:14:29.561,000 --> 0:14:32,000
while we green our industries and remove CO2.

265
0:14:33.655,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It definitely means we must work now

266
0:14:36.941,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to understand our options for this kind of emergency medicine.

267
0:14:41.901,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Thank you,

268
0:14:43.076,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

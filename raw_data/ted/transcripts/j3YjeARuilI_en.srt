1
0:00:12.245,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Mobility in developing world cities

2
0:00:15.378,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is a very peculiar challenge,

3
0:00:17.536,000 --> 0:00:18,000
because different from health

4
0:00:19.341,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or education or housing,

5
0:00:21.651,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it tends to get worse as societies become richer.

6
0:00:25.085,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Clearly, a unsustainable model.

7
0:00:27.869,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Mobility, as most other developing country problems,

8
0:00:32.196,000 --> 0:00:35,000
more than a matter of money or technology,

9
0:00:36.101,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is a matter of equality, equity.

10
0:00:41.492,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The great inequality in developing countries

11
0:00:44.601,000 --> 0:00:47,000
makes it difficult to see, for example,

12
0:00:48.026,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that in terms of transport,

13
0:00:50.59,000 --> 0:00:51,000
an advanced city is not one

14
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where even the poor use cars,

15
0:00:54.542,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but rather one where even the rich

16
0:00:56.565,000 --> 0:00:58,000
use public transport.

17
0:00:58.789,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,

18
0:01:02.355,000 --> 0:01:04,000
more than 30 percent of the population

19
0:01:04.385,000 --> 0:01:05,000
uses bicycles,

20
0:01:05.92,000 --> 0:01:06,000
despite the fact that the Netherlands has

21
0:01:07.818,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a higher income per capita than the United States.

22
0:01:11.801,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There is a conflict in developing world cities

23
0:01:15.658,000 --> 0:01:17,000
for money, for government investment.

24
0:01:18.226,000 --> 0:01:2,000
If more money is invested in highways,

25
0:01:20.727,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of course there is less money for housing,

26
0:01:22.739,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for schools, for hospitals,

27
0:01:25.096,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and also there is a conflict for space.

28
0:01:29.072,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There is a conflict for space between

29
0:01:31.498,000 --> 0:01:33,000
those with cars and those without them.

30
0:01:34.023,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Most of us accept today

31
0:01:35.866,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that private property and a market economy

32
0:01:38.65,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is the best way to manage most of society's resources.

33
0:01:41.848,000 --> 0:01:43,000
However, there is a problem with that,

34
0:01:44.253,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that market economy needs

35
0:01:46.921,000 --> 0:01:48,000
inequality of income in order to work.

36
0:01:49.639,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Some people must make more money,

37
0:01:51.181,000 --> 0:01:52,000
some others less.

38
0:01:52.732,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Some companies succeed. Others fail.

39
0:01:55.301,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Then what kind of equality

40
0:01:57.175,000 --> 0:01:58,000
can we hope for today

41
0:01:58.78,000 --> 0:01:59,000
with a market economy?

42
0:02:00.702,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I would propose two kinds

43
0:02:02.638,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which both have much to do with cities.

44
0:02:04.992,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The first one is equality of quality of life,

45
0:02:08.098,000 --> 0:02:09,000
especially for children,

46
0:02:09.886,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that all children should have,

47
0:02:11.541,000 --> 0:02:14,000
beyond the obvious health and education,

48
0:02:14.548,000 --> 0:02:17,000
access to green spaces, to sports facilities,

49
0:02:18.407,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to swimming pools, to music lessons.

50
0:02:21.433,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And the second kind of equality

51
0:02:23.924,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is one which we could call "democratic equality."

52
0:02:28.207,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The first article in every constitution states

53
0:02:31.156,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that all citizens are equal before the law.

54
0:02:34.445,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That is not just poetry.

55
0:02:36.9,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's a very powerful principle.

56
0:02:39.101,000 --> 0:02:41,000
For example, if that is true,

57
0:02:41.687,000 --> 0:02:42,000
a bus with 80 passengers

58
0:02:43.572,000 --> 0:02:45,000
has a right to 80 times more road space

59
0:02:46.301,000 --> 0:02:48,000
than a car with one.

60
0:02:49.173,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,

61
0:02:53.566,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that it's before our noses and we do not see it.

62
0:02:57.297,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Less than 100 years ago,

63
0:02:59.573,000 --> 0:03:,000
women could not vote,

64
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and it seemed normal,

65
0:03:03.166,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the same way that it seems normal today

66
0:03:06.85,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to see a bus in traffic.

67
0:03:09.782,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In fact, when I became mayor,

68
0:03:12.733,000 --> 0:03:14,000
applying that democratic principle

69
0:03:15.701,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that public good prevails over private interest,

70
0:03:18.113,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that a bus with 100 people

71
0:03:21.013,000 --> 0:03:23,000
has a right to 100 times more road space than a car,

72
0:03:23.587,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we implemented a mass transit system

73
0:03:26.601,000 --> 0:03:28,000
based on buses in exclusive lanes.

74
0:03:29.07,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We called it TransMilenio, in order to make buses sexier.

75
0:03:33.512,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,

76
0:03:41.309,000 --> 0:03:45,000
expensive cars stuck in traffic,

77
0:03:45.473,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.

78
0:03:51.8,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.

79
0:03:55.629,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It doesn't take Ph.D.'s.

80
0:03:57.521,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A committee of 12-year-old children

81
0:03:59.793,000 --> 0:04:01,000
would find out in 20 minutes

82
0:04:01.799,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that the most efficient way to use scarce road space

83
0:04:05.503,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is with exclusive lanes for buses.

84
0:04:08.987,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In fact, buses are not sexy,

85
0:04:12.309,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but they are the only possible means

86
0:04:15.456,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to bring mass transit to all areas

87
0:04:18.739,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of fast growing developing cities.

88
0:04:22.414,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They also have great capacity.

89
0:04:24.589,000 --> 0:04:26,000
For example, this system in Guangzhou

90
0:04:27.333,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is moving more passengers our direction

91
0:04:30.038,000 --> 0:04:32,000
than all subway lines in China,

92
0:04:32.862,000 --> 0:04:34,000
except for one line in Beijing,

93
0:04:35.353,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at a fraction of the cost.

94
0:04:37.69,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We fought not just for space for buses,

95
0:04:41.804,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but we fought for space for people,

96
0:04:44.86,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and that was even more difficult.

97
0:04:48.073,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Cities are human habitats,

98
0:04:50.858,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and we humans are pedestrians.

99
0:04:54.587,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly

100
0:04:57.651,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or deer need to run, we need to walk.

101
0:05:00.443,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There is a really enormous conflict,

102
0:05:03.774,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when we are talking about developing country cities,

103
0:05:06.775,000 --> 0:05:08,000
between pedestrians and cars.

104
0:05:09.454,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Here, what you see is a picture that shows

105
0:05:12.385,000 --> 0:05:13,000
insufficient democracy.

106
0:05:14.037,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What this shows is that people who walk

107
0:05:17.129,000 --> 0:05:18,000
are third-class citizens

108
0:05:18.804,000 --> 0:05:19,000
while those who go in cars

109
0:05:20.139,000 --> 0:05:21,000
are first-class citizens.

110
0:05:21.954,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In terms of transport infrastructure,

111
0:05:24.361,000 --> 0:05:25,000
what really makes a difference

112
0:05:25.564,000 --> 0:05:27,000
between advanced and backward cities

113
0:05:28.11,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is not highways or subways

114
0:05:30.202,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but quality sidewalks.

115
0:05:32.466,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,

116
0:05:35.232,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and they forgot to make a sidewalk.

117
0:05:39.19,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is prevailing all over the world.

118
0:05:41.514,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars.

119
0:05:45.299,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In my city of Bogotá,

120
0:05:47.54,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we fought a very difficult battle

121
0:05:50.894,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in order to take space from cars,

122
0:05:53.668,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,

123
0:05:56.564,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in order to make space for people that should reflect

124
0:05:59.679,000 --> 0:06:,000
dignity of human beings,

125
0:06:01.347,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and to make space for protected bikeways.

126
0:06:04.196,000 --> 0:06:06,000
First of all, I had black hair before that.

127
0:06:06.941,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:08.917,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I was almost impeached in the process.

129
0:06:12.173,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It is a very difficult battle.

130
0:06:14.317,000 --> 0:06:17,000
However, it was possible, finally,

131
0:06:17.494,000 --> 0:06:2,000
after very difficult battles, to make a city

132
0:06:20.732,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that would reflect some respect for human dignity,

133
0:06:23.416,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that would show that those who walk are equally

134
0:06:25.211,000 --> 0:06:26,000
important to those who have cars.

135
0:06:27.032,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Indeed, a very important ideological and political issue anywhere

136
0:06:31.681,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is how to distribute that most valuable resource

137
0:06:34.627,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of a city, which is road space.

138
0:06:37.036,000 --> 0:06:39,000
A city could find oil or diamonds underground

139
0:06:39.873,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it would not be so valuable as road space.

140
0:06:41.964,000 --> 0:06:44,000
How to distribute it between pedestrians,

141
0:06:45.125,000 --> 0:06:48,000
bicycles, public transport and cars?

142
0:06:48.227,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This is not a technological issue,

143
0:06:51.018,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we should remember that in no constitution

144
0:06:54.542,000 --> 0:06:56,000
parking is a constitutional right

145
0:06:56.863,000 --> 0:06:58,000
when we make that distribution.

146
0:06:59.364,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We also built, and this was 15 years ago,

147
0:07:02.995,000 --> 0:07:03,000
before there were bikeways in New York

148
0:07:04.933,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or in Paris or in London,

149
0:07:06.377,000 --> 0:07:08,000
it was a very difficult battle as well,

150
0:07:08.824,000 --> 0:07:12,000
more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.

151
0:07:13.644,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I don't think protected bicycle ways

152
0:07:15.568,000 --> 0:07:17,000
are a cute architectural feature.

153
0:07:18.322,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They are a right, just as sidewalks are,

154
0:07:21.028,000 --> 0:07:23,000
unless we believe that only those

155
0:07:23.226,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with access to a motor vehicle

156
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:27,000
have a right to safe mobility,

157
0:07:27.627,000 --> 0:07:29,000
without the risk of getting killed.

158
0:07:29.9,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And just as busways are,

159
0:07:33.567,000 --> 0:07:35,000
protected bikeways also are

160
0:07:35.658,000 --> 0:07:36,000
a powerful symbol of democracy,

161
0:07:37.537,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle

162
0:07:41.187,000 --> 0:07:43,000
is equally important

163
0:07:43.609,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to one in a $30,000 car.

164
0:07:47.551,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And we are living in a unique moment in history.

165
0:07:51.268,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities

166
0:07:55.72,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.

167
0:08:00.282,000 --> 0:08:02,000
In many developing country cities,

168
0:08:02.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
more than 80 and 90 percent

169
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of the city which will exist in 2060

170
0:08:09.342,000 --> 0:08:11,000
will be built over the next four or five decades.

171
0:08:11.703,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But this is not just a matter for developing country cities.

172
0:08:14.825,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In the United States, for example,

173
0:08:16.814,000 --> 0:08:18,000
more than 70 million new homes

174
0:08:19.479,000 --> 0:08:21,000
must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.

175
0:08:22.176,000 --> 0:08:25,000
That's more than all the homes that today exist

176
0:08:25.249,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in Britain, France and Canada put together.

177
0:08:29.765,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I believe that our cities today

178
0:08:33.122,000 --> 0:08:35,000
have severe flaws,

179
0:08:35.237,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and that different, better ones could be built.

180
0:08:38.795,000 --> 0:08:4,000
What is wrong with our cities today?

181
0:08:41.243,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child

182
0:08:45.477,000 --> 0:08:46,000
who is barely learning to speak

183
0:08:47.182,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in any city in the world today,

184
0:08:48.693,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"Watch out, a car,"

185
0:08:50.375,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the child will jump in fright,

186
0:08:52.937,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and with a very good reason, because there are

187
0:08:54.716,000 --> 0:08:56,000
more than 10,000 children who are killed

188
0:08:57.273,000 --> 0:09:,000
by cars every year in the world.

189
0:09:00.742,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We have had cities for 8,000 years,

190
0:09:03.35,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and children could walk out of home and play.

191
0:09:07.686,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In fact, only very recently,

192
0:09:09.978,000 --> 0:09:1,000
towards 1900, there were no cars.

193
0:09:11.812,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Cars have been here for really less than 100 years.

194
0:09:15.813,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They completely changed cities.

195
0:09:18.587,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In 1900, for example,

196
0:09:20.535,000 --> 0:09:23,000
nobody was killed by cars in the United States.

197
0:09:24.421,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Only 20 years later,

198
0:09:26.336,000 --> 0:09:29,000
between 1920 and 1930,

199
0:09:29.731,000 --> 0:09:31,000
almost 200,000 people

200
0:09:32.089,000 --> 0:09:34,000
were killed by cars in the United States.

201
0:09:34.599,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children

202
0:09:38.63,000 --> 0:09:41,000
were killed by cars in the United States.

203
0:09:42.582,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So we could make different cities,

204
0:09:46.585,000 --> 0:09:48,000
cities that will give more priority to human beings

205
0:09:49.346,000 --> 0:09:51,000
than to cars, that will give more public space

206
0:09:51.805,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to human beings than to cars,

207
0:09:53.929,000 --> 0:09:55,000
cities which show great respect

208
0:09:56.684,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for those most vulnerable citizens,

209
0:09:58.845,000 --> 0:09:59,000
such as children or the elderly.

210
0:10:00.629,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I will propose to you a couple of ingredients

211
0:10:04.434,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which I think would make cities much better,

212
0:10:07.776,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and it would be very simple to implement them

213
0:10:10.261,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in the new cities which are only being created.

214
0:10:13.185,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Hundreds of kilometers of greenways

215
0:10:16.238,000 --> 0:10:19,000
criss-crossing cities in all directions.

216
0:10:19.388,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.

217
0:10:22.132,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They could go for dozens of kilometers safely

218
0:10:25.093,000 --> 0:10:28,000
without any risk in wonderful greenways,

219
0:10:28.147,000 --> 0:10:3,000
sort of bicycle highways,

220
0:10:30.563,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I would invite you to imagine the following:

221
0:10:33.668,000 --> 0:10:36,000
a city in which every other street would be

222
0:10:36.906,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.

223
0:10:41.992,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In new cities which are going to be built,

224
0:10:44.223,000 --> 0:10:46,000
this would not be particularly difficult.

225
0:10:46.768,000 --> 0:10:49,000
When I was mayor of Bogotá,

226
0:10:50.295,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in only three years, we were able to create

227
0:10:52.825,000 --> 0:10:54,000
70 kilometers,

228
0:10:54.963,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in one of the most dense cities in the world,

229
0:10:57.459,000 --> 0:10:59,000
of these bicycle highways.

230
0:10:59.826,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And this changes the way people live,

231
0:11:03.216,000 --> 0:11:05,000
move, enjoy the city.

232
0:11:05.888,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods,

233
0:11:08.509,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,

234
0:11:11.579,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and the cars still in the mud.

235
0:11:13.94,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.

236
0:11:16.763,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But what do we do first?

237
0:11:18.211,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars.

238
0:11:21.372,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But you see, when a city is only being created,

239
0:11:23.845,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it's very easy to incorporate

240
0:11:25.935,000 --> 0:11:27,000
this kind of infrastructure.

241
0:11:28.111,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Then the city grows around it.

242
0:11:30.809,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And of course this is just a glimpse

243
0:11:33.852,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of something which could be much better

244
0:11:36.647,000 --> 0:11:37,000
if we just create it,

245
0:11:38.365,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and it changes the way of life.

246
0:11:40.702,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And the second ingredient, which would solve mobility,

247
0:11:44.768,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that very difficult challenge in developing countries,

248
0:11:47.346,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in a very low-cost and simple way,

249
0:11:50.341,000 --> 0:11:54,000
would be to have hundreds of kilometers

250
0:11:54.353,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of streets only for buses,

251
0:11:56.875,000 --> 0:11:59,000
buses and bicycles and pedestrians.

252
0:11:59.979,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This would be, again, a very low-cost solution

253
0:12:03.018,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if implemented from the start,

254
0:12:05.341,000 --> 0:12:07,000
low cost, pleasant transit

255
0:12:07.864,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with natural sunlight.

256
0:12:11.562,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But unfortunately, reality is not as good

257
0:12:16.21,000 --> 0:12:17,000
as my dreams.

258
0:12:17.962,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Because of private property of land

259
0:12:21.144,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and high land prices,

260
0:12:24.165,000 --> 0:12:27,000
all developing country cities have a large problem of slums.

261
0:12:27.202,000 --> 0:12:29,000
In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes

262
0:12:30.112,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in cities initially were illegal developments.

263
0:12:35.458,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And of course it's very difficult to have

264
0:12:38.67,000 --> 0:12:41,000
mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.

265
0:12:42.626,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But even legal developments

266
0:12:44.672,000 --> 0:12:46,000
have also been located in the wrong places,

267
0:12:47.644,000 --> 0:12:49,000
very far from the city centers

268
0:12:50.445,000 --> 0:12:52,000
where it's impossible to provide

269
0:12:52.482,000 --> 0:12:55,000
low-cost, high-frequency public transport.

270
0:12:56.313,000 --> 0:12:58,000
As a Latin American, and Latin America

271
0:12:59.193,000 --> 0:13:02,000
was the most recently organized region in the world,

272
0:13:02.62,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,

273
0:13:07.78,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to those countries which are yet to urbanize --

274
0:13:11.89,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950

275
0:13:16.911,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to 80 percent urban in 2010 --

276
0:13:22.984,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I would recommend Asian and African countries

277
0:13:26.144,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which are yet to urbanize,

278
0:13:27.926,000 --> 0:13:31,000
such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,

279
0:13:32.093,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that governments should acquire all land around cities.

280
0:13:35.068,000 --> 0:13:37,000
In this way, their cities could grow in the right places

281
0:13:37.589,000 --> 0:13:38,000
with the right spaces, with the parks,

282
0:13:39.364,000 --> 0:13:42,000
with the greenways, with the busways.

283
0:13:42.74,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The cities we are going to build

284
0:13:44.255,000 --> 0:13:45,000
over the next 50 years

285
0:13:46.095,000 --> 0:13:48,000
will determine quality of life and even happiness

286
0:13:48.492,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for billions of people towards the future.

287
0:13:50.646,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What a fantastic opportunity for leaders

288
0:13:54.224,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and many young leaders to come,

289
0:13:56.466,000 --> 0:13:58,000
especially in the developing countries.

290
0:13:58.533,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They can create a much happier life

291
0:14:00.38,000 --> 0:14:01,000
for billions towards the future.

292
0:14:01.949,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I am sure, I am optimistic,

293
0:14:03.912,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that they will make cities better

294
0:14:05.82,000 --> 0:14:08,000
than our most ambitious dreams.

295
0:14:08.989,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This is 26th, that's 27th."

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Streets have names; blocks are just the

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
unnamed spaces in between streets."

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you turn to a person next to you and say,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Blocks have names.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
All of these blocks have names,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There's Block 17, house number one."

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The second house ever built is house number two.

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, I love that sometimes we need to

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
go to the opposite side of the world

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So, for example, there are doctors in China

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Applause)

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In most music, we think of the "one"

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But in West African music, the "one"

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is thought of as the end of the phrase,

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like the period at the end of a sentence.

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
two, three, four, one.

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And this map is also accurate.

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the opposite is also true.

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that the opposite may also be true.

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Domo arigato gozaimashita.

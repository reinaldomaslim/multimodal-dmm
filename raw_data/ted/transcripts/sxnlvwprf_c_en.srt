0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A few months ago,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in a hospital close to where I live,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and she was brought in confused.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Her blood pressure was an alarming

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
230 over 170.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She was resuscitated, stabilized,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
whisked over to a CAT scan suite

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
right next to the emergency room,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And the CAT scan revealed

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
no blood clots in the lung,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
breast tumors,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that had metastasized widely

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all over the body.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
she had been seen

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in four or five other health care institutions

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the preceding two years.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Four or five opportunities

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
intervene at a much earlier stage

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
than when we saw her.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that is not an unusual story.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Unfortunately, it happens all the time.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I joke, but I only half joke,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or orthopedic consult.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I am not a Luddite.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I teach at Stanford.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But I'd like to make the case to you

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in the next 17 minutes

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that when we shortcut the physical exam,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
when we lean towards ordering tests

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
instead of talking to and examining the patient,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we not only overlook simple diagnoses

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but we're losing much more than that.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We're losing a ritual.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and is at the heart

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of the patient-physician relationship.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This may actually be heresy to say this at TED,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but I'd like to introduce you

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to the most important innovation,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I think, in medicine

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to come in the next 10 years,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and that is the power of the human hand --

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to touch, to comfort, to diagnose

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and to bring about treatment.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I'd like to introduce you first to this person

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
whose image you may or may not recognize.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Since we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
here in Edinburgh,

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and his character, Sherlock Holmes,

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
described the following exchange

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
between Bell and his students.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
students all around him,

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
patients signing up in the emergency room

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and being registered and being brought in.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And a woman comes in with a child,

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The woman says, "Good Morning."

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Bell says, "What sort of crossing did you have

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
on the ferry from Burntisland?"

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
She says, "It was good."

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And he says, "What did you do with the other child?"

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
She says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And he says,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to get here to the infirmary?"

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She says, "I did."

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And she says, "I am."

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
He says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,'

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I picked up her Fife accent.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so she must have taken the ferry over.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You notice that the coat she's carrying

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is too small for the child who is with her,

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and therefore, she started out the journey with two children,

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but dropped one off along the way.

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
except in the botanical gardens.

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to arrive here.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And finally, she has a dermatitis

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on the fingers of her right hand,

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a dermatitis that is unique

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And when Bell actually strips the patient,

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
begins to examine the patient,

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you can only imagine how much more he would discern.

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I was so inspired by that story.

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But you might not realize

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that our ability to look into the body

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in this simple way, using our senses,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is quite recent.

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who, in the late 1700s,

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
discovered percussion.

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was the son of an innkeeper.

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And his father used to go down into the basement

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to tap on the sides of casks of wine

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to determine how much wine was left

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and whether to reorder.

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so when Auenbrugger became a physician,

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
he began to do the same thing.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
He began to tap on the chests of his patients,

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on their abdomens.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And basically everything we know about percussion,

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day --

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
abdominal changes --

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,"

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which would have disappeared into obscurity,

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
a famous French physician --

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
famous only because he was physician to this gentleman --

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it was followed a year or two later

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
by Laennec discovering the stethoscope.

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and saw two children playing with a stick.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One was scratching at the end of the stick,

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
another child listened at the other end.

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
using what he called "the cylinder."

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Later he renamed it the stethoscope.

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So within a few years,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
all of a sudden,

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the barber surgeon had given way

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
If you'll recall, prior to that time,

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who wound up cupping you,

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
bleeding you, purging you.

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And, oh yes, if you wanted,

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back --

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and pull your tooth while he was at it.

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
He made no attempt at diagnosis.

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In fact, some of you might well know

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that the barber pole, the red and white stripes,

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the receptacles on either end

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
represent the pots in which the blood was collected.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But the arrival of auscultation and percussion

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
represented a sea change,

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And this particular painting, I think,

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is a very famous painting:

172
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
who then established the Tate Gallery.

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of social importance.

177
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Fildes' oldest son, Philip,

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
after a brief illness.

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And Fildes was so taken by the physician

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
who held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that he decided that he would try and depict

184
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the physician in our time --

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
almost a tribute to this physician.

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.

188
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I've often wondered, what would Fildes have done

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
had he been asked to paint this painting

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in the modern era,

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in the year 2011?

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Would he have substituted a computer screen

193
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for where he had the patient?

194
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley

195
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for saying that the patient in the bed

196
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
has almost become an icon

197
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
for the real patient who's in the computer.

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.

199
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I call it the iPatient.

200
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.

201
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The real patient often wonders,

202
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where is everyone?

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When are they going to come by and explain things to me?

204
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Who's in charge?

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception

206
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.

207
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I want to show you a picture

208
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of what rounds looked like

209
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when I was in training.

210
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The focus was around the patient.

211
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.

212
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Too often these days,

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
rounds look very much like this,

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where the discussion is taking place

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in a room far away from the patient.

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the one critical piece missing

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is that of the patient.

219
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now I've been influenced in this thinking

220
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
by two anecdotes that I want to share with you.

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
had a small breast cancer detected --

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is when I was in Texas.

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And she then spent a lot of time researching

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to find the best cancer center in the world

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to get her subsequent care.

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And she found the place and decided to go there, went there.

229
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Which is why I was surprised a few months later

230
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to see her back in our own town,

231
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I pressed her, and I asked her,

233
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Why did you come back and get your care here?"

234
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And she was reluctant to tell me.

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
She said, "The cancer center was wonderful.

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It had a beautiful facility,

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
giant atrium, valet parking,

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a piano that played itself,

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a concierge that took you around from here to there.

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But," she said,

241
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
"but they did not touch my breasts."

242
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now you and I could argue

243
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that they probably did not need to touch her breasts.

244
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They had her scanned inside out.

245
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they had no need to touch her breasts.

247
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But to her, it mattered deeply.

248
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It was enough for her to make the decision

249
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist

250
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who, every time she went,

251
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
examined both breasts including the axillary tail,

252
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
examined her axilla carefully,

253
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
examined her cervical region, her inguinal region,

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
did a thorough exam.

255
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.

256
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I was very influenced by that anecdote.

257
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I was also influenced by another experience that I had,

258
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.

259
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I had a reputation

260
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
as being interested in patients

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with chronic fatigue.

262
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.

263
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I say that because these are difficult patients.

264
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They have often been rejected by their families,

265
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
have had bad experiences with medical care

266
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and they come to you fully prepared

267
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for you to join the long list of people

268
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
who's about to disappoint them.

269
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And I learned very early on with my first patient

270
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that I could not do justice

271
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to this very complicated patient

272
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
with all the records they were bringing

273
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in a new patient visit of 45 minutes.

274
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
There was just no way.

275
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them.

276
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And so I hit on this method

277
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where I invited the patient

278
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to tell me the story for their entire first visit,

279
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and I tried not to interrupt them.

280
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We know the average American physician

281
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
interrupts their patient in 14 seconds.

282
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And if I ever get to heaven,

283
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes

284
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and did not interrupt my patient.

285
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,

286
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and when the patient came for the physical,

287
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I was able to do a thorough physical,

288
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because I had nothing else to do.

289
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,

290
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but because the whole visit was now about the physical,

291
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.

292
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And I remember my very first patient in that series

293
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
continued to tell me more history

294
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
during what was meant to be the physical exam visit.

295
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I began my ritual.

296
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I always begin with the pulse,

297
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
then I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,

298
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and I was into my ritual.

300
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And when my ritual began,

301
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
this very voluble patient

302
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
began to quiet down.

303
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And I remember having a very eerie sense

304
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that the patient and I

305
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
had slipped back into a primitive ritual

306
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
in which I had a role

307
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the patient had a role.

308
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And when I was done,

309
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the patient said to me with some awe,

310
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"I have never been examined like this before."

311
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Now if that were true,

312
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it's a true condemnation of our health care system,

313
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because they had been seen in other places.

314
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I then proceeded to tell the patient,

315
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
once the patient was dressed,

316
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,

317
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
which is, "This is not in your head.

318
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
This is real.

319
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,

320
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.

321
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,

322
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but here's what you should do, here's what we should do."

323
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I would lay out all the standard treatment options

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that the patient had heard elsewhere.

325
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And I always felt

326
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that if my patient gave up the quest

327
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
for the magic doctor, the magic treatment

328
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and began with me on a course towards wellness,

329
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it was because I had earned the right

330
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to tell them these things

331
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
by virtue of the examination.

332
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I took this to my colleagues

334
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
at Stanford in anthropology

335
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and told them the same story.

336
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And they immediately said to me,

337
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"Well you are describing a classic ritual."

338
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And they helped me understand

339
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that rituals are all about transformation.

340
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We marry, for example,

341
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
with great pomp and ceremony and expense

342
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to signal our departure

343
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness

344
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to one of eternal bliss.

345
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I'm not sure why you're laughing.

346
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
That was the original intent, was it not?

347
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We signal transitions of power

348
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
with rituals.

349
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We signal the passage of a life with rituals.

350
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Rituals are terribly important.

351
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They're all about transformation.

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Well I would submit to you

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that the ritual

354
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
of one individual coming to another

355
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and telling them things

356
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,

357
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and then, incredibly on top of that,

358
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
disrobing and allowing touch --

359
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.

360
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And if you shortchange that ritual

361
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
by not undressing the patient,

362
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,

363
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
by not doing a complete exam,

364
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you have bypassed on the opportunity

365
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to seal the patient-physician relationship.

366
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I am a writer,

367
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote

368
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that has to do very much with this scene.

369
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I'm an infectious disease physician,

370
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,

371
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I presided over so many scenes like this.

372
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,

373
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
whether in the hospital or at home,

374
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I remember my sense of failure --

375
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
the feeling of I don't know what I have to say;

376
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I don't know what I can say;

377
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

378
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And out of that sense of failure,

379
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I remember, I would always examine the patient.

380
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I would pull down the eyelids.

381
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I would look at the tongue.

382
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.

383
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I would feel the abdomen.

384
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I remember so many patients,

385
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
their names still vivid on my tongue,

386
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
their faces still so clear.

387
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes

388
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
staring up at me as I performed this ritual.

389
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And then the next day,

390
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I would come, and I would do it again.

391
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And I wanted to read you this one closing passage

392
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
about one patient.

393
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"I recall one patient

394
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
who was at that point

395
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
no more than a skeleton

396
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
encased in shrinking skin,

397
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
unable to speak,

398
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
his mouth crusted with candida

399
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that was resistant to the usual medications.

400
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
When he saw me

401
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,

402
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
his hands moved as if in slow motion.

403
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And as I wondered what he was up to,

404
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
his stick fingers made their way

405
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
up to his pajama shirt,

406
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
fumbling with his buttons.

407
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I realized that he was wanting

408
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
to expose his wicker-basket chest to me.

409
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
It was an offering, an invitation.

410
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I did not decline.

411
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.

412
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I think he surely must have known by then

413
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
that it was vital for me

414
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
just as it was necessary for him.

415
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Neither of us could skip this ritual,

416
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,

417
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.

418
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
No, this ritual was about the one message

419
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that physicians have needed to convey to their patients.

420
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris,

421
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
we seem to have drifted away.

422
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
We seem to have forgotten --

423
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
as though, with the explosion of knowledge,

424
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
the whole human genome mapped out at our feet,

425
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
we are lulled into inattention,

426
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,

427
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
necessary for the patient --

428
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
forgetting that the ritual has meaning

429
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and a singular message to convey to the patient.

430
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then,

431
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
even as I delivered it,

432
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and which I understand better now is this:

433
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I will always, always, always be there.

434
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
I will see you through this.

435
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I will never abandon you.

436
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I will be with you through the end."

437
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Thank you very much.

438
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

0:00:13.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Azim Khamisa: We humans have many defining moments in our lives.

2
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Sometimes these moments are joyous,

3
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and sometimes they are heartbreaking,

4
0:00:23.24,000 --> 0:00:24,000
tragic.

5
0:00:25.24,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But at these defining moments, if we are able to make the right choice,

6
0:00:30.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we literally manifest a miracle

7
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in us and others.

8
0:00:37.48,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My only son Tariq, a university student,

9
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:43,000
kind, generous, a good writer, a good photographer,

10
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
had aspirations to work for National Geographic,

11
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
engaged to a beautiful lady,

12
0:00:49.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
worked as a pizza deliveryman on Fridays and Saturdays.

13
0:00:54.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
He was lured to a bogus address

14
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:57,000
by a youth gang.

15
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And in a gang initiation,

16
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a 14-year-old shot and killed him.

17
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The sudden, senseless death

18
0:01:10.32,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of an innocent, unarmed human being;

19
0:01:15.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the overwhelming grief of a family;

20
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the total confusion as you try to absorb a new, hideous reality.

21
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Needless to say it brought my life to a crashing halt.

22
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
One of the hardest things I've ever had to do

23
0:01:31.48,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was to call his mother, who lived in a different city.

24
0:01:34.72,000 --> 0:01:37,000
How do you tell a mother she's never going to see her son again,

25
0:01:37.8,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or hear him laugh,

26
0:01:39.28,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or give him a hug?

27
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.

28
0:01:44.52,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I meditate two hours a day.

29
0:01:47.68,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And sometimes,

30
0:01:48.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in deep trauma and deep tragedy,

31
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:53,000
there is a spark of clarity.

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what I downloaded in my meditation

33
0:01:58.04,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is that there were victims at both ends of the gun.

34
0:02:02.4,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's easy to see that my son was a victim of the 14-year-old,

35
0:02:06.28,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a little bit complicated to see that he was a victim of American society.

36
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that begs the question, well, who is American society?

37
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, it's you and me,

38
0:02:16.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because I don't believe that society is just happenstance.

39
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I think we are all responsible for the society we've created.

40
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And children killing children is not a mark of a civil society.

41
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So nine months after Tariq died,

42
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

43
0:02:35.84,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and our mandate at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

44
0:02:38.52,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is to stop kids from killing kids

45
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by breaking the cycle of youth violence.

46
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And essentially we have three mandates.

47
0:02:45.72,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Our first and foremost is to save lives of children.

48
0:02:50.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's important to do. We lose so many on a daily basis.

49
0:02:54.6,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Our second mandate

50
0:02:57.28,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is to empower the right choices so kids don't fall through the cracks

51
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and choose lives of gangs and crime and drugs and alcohol and weapons.

52
0:03:06.36,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And our third mandate is to teach the principles of nonviolence,

53
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of empathy, of compassion,

54
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of forgiveness.

55
0:03:17.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I started with a very simple premise

56
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that violence is a learned behavior.

57
0:03:21.96,000 --> 0:03:22,000
No child was born violent.

58
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:26,000
If you accept that as a truism,

59
0:03:27.12,000 --> 0:03:3,000
nonviolence can also be a learned behavior,

60
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but you have to teach it,

61
0:03:31.64,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because kids are not going to learn that

62
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:35,000
through osmosis.

63
0:03:36.2,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Soon after that, I reached out to my brother here,

64
0:03:41.12,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with the attitude that we had both lost a son.

65
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:44,000
My son died.

66
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:46,000
He lost his grandson to the adult prison system.

67
0:03:47.4,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I asked him to join me.

68
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
As you see, 22 years later, we are still here together,

69
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because I can't bring Tariq back from the dead,

70
0:03:55.96,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you can't take Tony out of prison,

71
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but the one thing we can do

72
0:04:00.04,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is make sure no other young people in our community

73
0:04:03.12,000 --> 0:04:05,000
end up dead or end up in prison.

74
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:07,000
With the grace of God,

75
0:04:07.96,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the Tariq Khamisa Foundation has been successful.

76
0:04:10.88,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We have a safe school model

77
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which has four different programs.

78
0:04:15.8,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The first one is a live assembly with Ples and me.

79
0:04:18.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We are introduced,

80
0:04:20.04,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this man's grandson killed this man's son,

81
0:04:22.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and here they are together.

82
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We have in-classroom curriculum.

83
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We have an after school mentoring program, and we create a peace club.

84
0:04:29.92,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I'm happy to share with you

85
0:04:31.44,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that besides teaching these principles of nonviolence,

86
0:04:35.36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we are able to cut suspensions and expulsions by 70 percent,

87
0:04:40.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which is huge.

88
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

89
0:04:43.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Which is huge.

90
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Five years after Tariq died,

91
0:04:47.88,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and for me to complete my journey of forgiveness,

92
0:04:50.8,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I went to see the young man who killed my son.

93
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
He was 19 years old.

94
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I remember that meeting because we were --

95
0:04:59.08,000 --> 0:05:01,000
he's 37, still in prison --

96
0:05:01.24,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but at that first meeting, we locked eyeballs.

97
0:05:04.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm looking in his eyes, he's looking in my eyes,

98
0:05:06.92,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and I'm looking in his eyes trying to find a murderer, and I didn't.

99
0:05:10.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I was able to climb through his eyes

100
0:05:13.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and touch his humanity that I got

101
0:05:15.36,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that the spark in him was no different than the spark in me

102
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or anybody else here.

103
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So I wasn't expecting that. He was remorseful.

104
0:05:23.6,000 --> 0:05:25,000
He was articulate. He was well-mannered.

105
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I could tell that my hand of forgiveness had changed him.

106
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So with that, please welcome my brother, Ples.

107
0:05:33.48,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

108
0:05:38.92,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Ples Felix: Tony is my one and only daughter's one and only child.

109
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Tony was born to my daughter,

110
0:05:46.88,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who was 15 when she gave birth to Tony.

111
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Mothering is the toughest job on the planet.

112
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There is no tougher job on the planet than raising another human being

113
0:05:58.36,000 --> 0:06:,000
and making sure they're safe, secure

114
0:06:01.04,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and well-positioned to be successful in life.

115
0:06:04.6,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Tony experienced a lot of violence in his life as a young kid.

116
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He saw one of his favorite cousins

117
0:06:10.68,000 --> 0:06:12,000
be murdered in a hail of automatic weapon fire

118
0:06:13.2,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and gang involvement in Los Angeles.

119
0:06:15.56,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He was very traumatized in so many different ways.

120
0:06:19.36,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Tony came to live with me.

121
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I wanted to make sure he had everything a kid needed

122
0:06:23.84,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to be successful.

123
0:06:27.12,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But on this particular evening,

124
0:06:29.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
after years of being with me

125
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and struggling mightily to try to be successful

126
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and to live up to my expectations of being a successful person,

127
0:06:37.56,000 --> 0:06:4,000
on this one particular day, Tony ran away from home that evening,

128
0:06:40.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
he went to be with people he thought were his friends,

129
0:06:43.6,000 --> 0:06:44,000
he was given drugs and alcohol

130
0:06:45.08,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and he took them

131
0:06:46.36,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because he thought they would make him feel carefree.

132
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But all it did was to make his anxiety go higher

133
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and to create a more ...

134
0:06:57.32,000 --> 0:07:,000
more deadly thinking on his part.

135
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:02,000
He was invited to a robbery,

136
0:07:02.72,000 --> 0:07:03,000
he was given a 9mm handgun.

137
0:07:05.72,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And at the presence of an 18-year-old who commanded him

138
0:07:08.36,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and two 14-year-old boys he thought were his friends,

139
0:07:11.52,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he shot and killed Tariq Khamisa,

140
0:07:14.76,000 --> 0:07:15,000
this man's son.

141
0:07:19.84,000 --> 0:07:21,000
There are no words, there are no words

142
0:07:22.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that can express the loss of a child.

143
0:07:27.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
At my understanding that my grandson was responsible

144
0:07:29.72,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for the murder of this human being,

145
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I went to the prayer closet, like I was taught by my old folks,

146
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and began to pray and meditate.

147
0:07:36.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The one thing that Mr. Khamisa and I have in common,

148
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and we didn't know this, besides being wonderful human beings,

149
0:07:42.28,000 --> 0:07:43,000
is that we both meditate.

150
0:07:43.53,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:44.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It was very helpful for me

152
0:07:46.4,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because it offered me an opportunity to seek guidance and clarity

153
0:07:49.92,000 --> 0:07:54,000
about how I wanted to be of support of this man and his family in this loss.

154
0:07:55.72,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And sure enough, my prayers were answered,

155
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because I was invited to a meeting at this man's house,

156
0:08:00.76,000 --> 0:08:02,000
met his mother, his father,

157
0:08:03.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
his wife, his brother, met their family

158
0:08:06.68,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and had a chance to be in the presence of God-spirited people led by this man,

159
0:08:11.92,000 --> 0:08:13,000
who in the spirit of forgiveness,

160
0:08:14.12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
made way, made an opportunity for me

161
0:08:17.68,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to be of value and to share with him and to share with children

162
0:08:20.68,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the importance of understanding the need to be with a responsible adult,

163
0:08:25.92,000 --> 0:08:27,000
focus on your anger in a way that's healthy,

164
0:08:28.32,000 --> 0:08:29,000
learn to meditate.

165
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The programs that we have in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation

166
0:08:32.84,000 --> 0:08:35,000
provide so many tools for the kids to put in their toolkit

167
0:08:35.92,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so they could carry them throughout their lives.

168
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's important that our children understand that loving, caring adults

169
0:08:41.52,000 --> 0:08:42,000
care for them and support them,

170
0:08:43.08,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but it's also important that our children learn to meditate,

171
0:08:47.32,000 --> 0:08:48,000
learn to be peaceful,

172
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:5,000
learn to be centered

173
0:08:50.48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and learn to interact with the other children

174
0:08:52.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in a kind, empathetic

175
0:08:54.799,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and wonderfully loving way.

176
0:08:56.96,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We need more love in our society

177
0:08:58.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and that's why we are here to share the love with children,

178
0:09:01.88,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because our children will lead the way for us,

179
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because all of us will depend on our children.

180
0:09:07.12,000 --> 0:09:1,000
As we grow older and retire, they will take over this world for us,

181
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
so as much love as we teach them, they will give it back to us.

182
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Blessings. Thank you.

183
0:09:15.88,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

184
0:09:22.4,000 --> 0:09:25,000
AK: So I was born in Kenya, I was educated in England,

185
0:09:26.12,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and my brother here is a Baptist.

186
0:09:28.88,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.

187
0:09:31.48,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He's African American,

188
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but I always tell him, I'm the African American in the group.

189
0:09:35.68,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I was born in Africa. You were not.

190
0:09:37.4,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:39.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I naturalized as a citizen.

192
0:09:41.92,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I'm a first-generation citizen.

193
0:09:43.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And I felt that, as an American citizen,

194
0:09:47.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I must take my share of the responsibility

195
0:09:50.88,000 --> 0:09:52,000
for the murder of my son.

196
0:09:53.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Why? Because it was fired by an American child.

197
0:09:57.56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You could take the position, he killed my one and only son,

198
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
he should be hung from the highest pole.

199
0:10:03.52,000 --> 0:10:05,000
How does that improve society?

200
0:10:06.48,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And I know you are probably wondering what happened to that young man.

201
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:14,000
He's still in prison. He just turned 37 on September 22,

202
0:10:15.52,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but I have some good news.

203
0:10:17.44,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We've been trying to get him out for 12 years.

204
0:10:20.24,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He finally will join us a year from now.

205
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

206
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And I'm very excited to have him join us,

207
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
because I know we've saved him,

208
0:10:35.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but he will save tens of thousands of students

209
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
when he shares his testimony

210
0:10:41.12,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in schools that we are present at on a regular basis.

211
0:10:44.52,000 --> 0:10:47,000
When he says to the kids, "When I was 11, I joined a gang.

212
0:10:47.88,000 --> 0:10:49,000
When I was 14, I murdered Mr. Khamisa's son.

213
0:10:50.8,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I've spent the last umpteen years in prison.

214
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I'm here to tell you: it's not worth it,"

215
0:10:56.48,000 --> 0:10:58,000
do you think the kids will listen to that voice?

216
0:10:59.12,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Yes, because his intonations

217
0:11:01.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
will be of a person that pulled the trigger.

218
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I know that he wants to turn the clock back.

219
0:11:10.48,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Of course, that's not possible.

220
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I wish it was. I would have my son back.

221
0:11:14.76,000 --> 0:11:16,000
My brother would have his grandson back.

222
0:11:17.92,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So I think that demonstrates the power of forgiveness.

223
0:11:23.64,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So what's the big takeaway here?

224
0:11:27.4,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So I want to end our session with this quote,

225
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
which is the basis of my fourth book,

226
0:11:32.88,000 --> 0:11:33,000
which incidentally,

227
0:11:34.76,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the foreword for that book was written by Tony.

228
0:11:38.8,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So it goes like this: sustained goodwill creates friendship.

229
0:11:42.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
You don't make friends by bombing them, right?

230
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You make friends by extending goodwill.

231
0:11:46.92,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That ought to be obvious.

232
0:11:48.36,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So sustained goodwill creates friendship,

233
0:11:50.84,000 --> 0:11:52,000
sustained friendship creates trust,

234
0:11:53.28,000 --> 0:11:55,000
sustained trust creates empathy,

235
0:11:55.72,000 --> 0:11:57,000
sustained empathy creates compassion,

236
0:11:58.12,000 --> 0:12:,000
and sustained compassion creates peace.

237
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I call this my peace formula.

238
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It starts with goodwill, friendship, trust, empathy, compassion and peace.

239
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But people ask me, how do you extend goodwill

240
0:12:11.76,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to the person who murdered your child?

241
0:12:14.8,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I tell them, you do that through forgiveness.

242
0:12:17.36,000 --> 0:12:19,000
As it's evident it worked for me.

243
0:12:19.52,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It worked for my family.

244
0:12:21.44,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What's a miracle is it worked for Tony,

245
0:12:24.12,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it worked for his family,

246
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:29,000
it can work for you and your family,

247
0:12:29.52,000 --> 0:12:31,000
for Israel and Palestine, North and South Korea,

248
0:12:32.52,000 --> 0:12:34,000
for Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.

249
0:12:35.4,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It can work for the United States of America.

250
0:12:38.68,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So let me leave you with this, my sisters,

251
0:12:41.96,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and a couple of brothers --

252
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Laughter)

253
0:12:45.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that peace is possible.

254
0:12:48.04,000 --> 0:12:49,000
How do I know that?

255
0:12:49.76,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because I am at peace.

256
0:12:51.64,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Thank you very much. Namaste.

257
0:12:53.64,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

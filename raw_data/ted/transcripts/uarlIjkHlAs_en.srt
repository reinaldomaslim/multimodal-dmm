1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi there.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to be talking a little bit about

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
music, machines and life.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Or, more specifically,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
for a music video.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Some of you may recognize this image.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We'll be showing the video at the end,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
what it is that they wanted.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
we were really excited because

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And we were very excited about this

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because, of course,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
they have a history of dancing with machines.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
50-million-plus views on YouTube.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Four guys dancing on treadmills,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
no cuts, just a static camera.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So we were really excited about working with them.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And they explained that they wanted

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, for those of you who don't know,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a Rube Goldberg machine

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is a complicated contraption,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that accomplishes a relatively simple task.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So we were excited by this idea,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and we started talking about

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
exactly what it would look like.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we came up with some parameters, because,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
has limitations,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but it also is pretty wide open.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And we wanted to make sure that we did something

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that would work for a music video.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we came up with a list of requirements,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the "10 commandments,"

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The first is "No magic."

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Everything that happened on screen had to be

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
very easily understood by a typical viewer.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
then we couldn't use it in the video.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They wanted band integration,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that is, the machine acting upon the band members,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
specifically not the other way around.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So as the song picks up emotion,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so should the machine

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
get grander in its process.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They wanted us to make use of the space.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
divided between two floors.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It included an exterior loading dock.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The machine itself would start the music.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So the machine would get started,

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it would travel some distance,

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
reacting along the way,

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
hit play on an iPod or a tape deck

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
or something that would start playback.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And speaking of synchronization,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they wanted it to sync to the rhythm

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and to hit specific beats along the way.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Okay. (Laughter)

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They wanted it to end precisely on time.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And they wanted the music to drop out

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
at a certain point in the video

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and actual live audio from the machine

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to play part of the song.

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And as if that wasn't enough,

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
all of these incredibly complicating things, right,

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they wanted it in one shot.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Applause)

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Okay.

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, just some statistics

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
about what we went through in the process.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The machine itself has

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
89 distinct interactions.

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It took us 85 takes

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to get it on film

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to our satisfaction.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Of those 85 takes,

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
only three actually successfully completed their run.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We destroyed two pianos

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and 10 televisions in the process.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And we lost one high-heeled shoe

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and returned back to the build --

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and left it in a pile of stuff.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And it's actually in the machine.

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what did we learn from all of this?

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, having completed this,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we have the opportunity to step back and reflect

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
on some of the things.

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And we learned that small stuff stinks.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Little balls in wooden tracks

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are really susceptible to

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they fall out of the tracks,

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the exact angles makes it hard to get right.

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It doesn't matter what temperature it is,

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
doesn't matter what's in its way;

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it will pretty much get where it needs to go.

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that we would have somewhere to go.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Small stuff stinks,

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but, of course, it's essential, right?

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
What else? Planning is incredibly important.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and even building some of these things.

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's been said that, "No battle plan

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
survives contact with the enemy."

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I think our enemy was physics --

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and she's a cruel mistress.

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Often, we had to pull things out as a result

137
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These are all things that ended up

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
not making it into the final machine.

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So also, put reliable stuff last,

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the stuff that's going to run every time.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Again, small to large is relevant here.

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
references the big, real car

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
near the end of the video.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and that's a problem.

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So you put that up front so that, if it fails,

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
at least you know

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you don't have to reset the whole thing.

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Life can be

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
messy.

157
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.

158
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And the wonderful elation that we had

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
when we finally completed it.

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"This Too Shall Pass."

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Thank you very much.

0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000

OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We are OK Go.

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.

172
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.

174
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Let me start again.

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."

Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?

178
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Sorry, start again.

0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Music)

2
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

3
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Thank you. Ooh, I'm like, "Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now." (Laughter)

4
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is

5
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
people scream out, "What's she doing?!"

6
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I'll play at these rock shows, be on stage

7
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
standing completely still, and they're like,

8
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"What's she doing?! What's she doing?!"

9
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And then I'll kind of be like -- (Vvvwow!) -- and then they're like, "Whoa!"

10
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

11
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I'm sure you're trying to figure out,

12
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Well, how does this thing work?"

13
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well, what I'm doing is

14
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
controlling the pitch with my left hand.

15
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets --

16
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Portamento) --

17
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and you can get it really low.

18
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And with this hand I'm controlling the volume,

19
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.

20
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Tones)

21
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So basically, with both of your hands

22
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of

23
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes,

24
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
when really it's continuously going ...

25
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Flourish ... Beep)

26
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

27
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Sometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on,

28
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and I'll lean over to pick up something,

29
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and then it goes like -- (Blip) -- "Oh!"

30
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around

31
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
if you don't turn the thing off.

32
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

33
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Maybe we'll go into the next tune,

34
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because I totally lost where this is going.

35
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone,"

36
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.

37
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Music)

38
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

39
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions

40
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that are commonly asked; there are so many.

41
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you

42
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a little of the history of the theremin.

43
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin

44
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --

45
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
he came up with the idea for making the theremin,

46
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.

47
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like (Screeching) --

48
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound

49
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."

50
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And so somehow through developing that,

51
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.

52
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays,

53
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,"

54
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,

55
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

56
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

57
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.

58
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
And sometimes if I have too much coffee,

59
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
then my vibrato gets out of hand.

60
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You're really sensitive to your body and its functions

61
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when you're behind this thing.

62
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.

63
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --

64
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance

65
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time

66
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;

67
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you want to be feeling the music.

68
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still

69
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because little movements with other parts of your body

70
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) --

71
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and breathing will make it ...

72
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

73
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
If I pass out on the next song ...

74
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

75
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I think of it almost like

76
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware

77
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
of every little crazy thing your body is doing,

78
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing

79
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.

80
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,

81
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"Here, have some drinks on us!"

82
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon;

83
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I don't want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?"

84
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It really does reflect the mood that you're in also,

85
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
if you're ...

86
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it's similar to being a vocalist, except

87
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
instead of it coming out of your throat,

88
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you're controlling it just in the air

89
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and you don't really have a point of reference;

90
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.

91
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You just have to always adjust to what's happening

92
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there

93
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,

94
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.

95
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I think we will play another tune now.

96
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I'm going to do "Lush Life." It's one of my favorite tunes to play.

97
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
(Music)

98
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
(Applause)

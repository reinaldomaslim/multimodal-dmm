1
0:00:13.112,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hi.

2
0:00:14.461,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Let me ask the audience a question:

3
0:00:16.831,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Did you ever lie as a child?

4
0:00:19.05,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you did, could you please raise your hand?

5
0:00:23.145,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Wow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met.

6
0:00:26.623,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.604,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So for the last 20 years,

8
0:00:30.337,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've been studying how children learn to tell lies.

9
0:00:33.776,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And today, I'm going to share with you

10
0:00:36.104,000 --> 0:00:38,000
some of the discoveries we have made.

11
0:00:38.624,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina,

12
0:00:43.573,000 --> 0:00:46,000
who is my friend and an elementary school principal.

13
0:00:47.266,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He got a phone call one day.

14
0:00:51.279,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The caller says,

15
0:00:52.454,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today

16
0:00:56.36,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because he's sick."

17
0:00:58.498,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Mr. Messina asks,

18
0:01:00.258,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Who am I speaking to, please?"

19
0:01:02.788,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And the caller says,

20
0:01:04.302,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"I am my father."

21
0:01:05.991,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:10.227,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So this story --

23
0:01:11.933,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:13.489,000 --> 0:01:17,000
sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have

25
0:01:17.823,000 --> 0:01:18,000
about children and lying.

26
0:01:20.14,000 --> 0:01:24,000
One, children only come to tell lies

27
0:01:24.795,000 --> 0:01:26,000
after entering elementary school.

28
0:01:27.552,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Two, children are poor liars.

29
0:01:29.887,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We adults can easily detect their lies.

30
0:01:32.768,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And three, if children lie at a very young age,

31
0:01:36.83,000 --> 0:01:38,000
there must be some character flaws with them,

32
0:01:39.703,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and they are going to become pathological liars for life.

33
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, it turns out

34
0:01:46.938,000 --> 0:01:48,000
all of the three beliefs are wrong.

35
0:01:50.617,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We have been playing guessing games

36
0:01:53.351,000 --> 0:01:55,000
with children all over the world.

37
0:01:55.457,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Here is an example.

38
0:01:56.967,000 --> 0:02:,000
So in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards.

39
0:02:01.958,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And we tell them if they win the game,

40
0:02:04.86,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they are going to get a big prize.

41
0:02:07.525,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But in the middle of the game,

42
0:02:09.026,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we make an excuse and leave the room.

43
0:02:13.763,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And before we leave the room,

44
0:02:15.721,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we tell them not to peek at the cards.

45
0:02:19.518,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Of course,

46
0:02:20.958,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we have hidden cameras in the room

47
0:02:23.143,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to watch their every move.

48
0:02:26.216,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Because the desire to win the game is so strong,

49
0:02:29.657,000 --> 0:02:32,000
more than 90 percent of children will peek

50
0:02:33.167,000 --> 0:02:34,000
as soon as we leave the room.

51
0:02:34.628,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:37.044,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The crucial question is:

53
0:02:39.054,000 --> 0:02:41,000
When we return and ask the children

54
0:02:41.826,000 --> 0:02:43,000
whether or not they have peeked,

55
0:02:44.159,000 --> 0:02:47,000
will the children who peeked confess

56
0:02:47.235,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or lie about their transgression?

57
0:02:51.525,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We found that regardless of gender, country, religion,

58
0:02:56.934,000 --> 0:02:57,000
at two years of age,

59
0:02:59.188,000 --> 0:03:,000
30 percent lie,

60
0:03:01.139,000 --> 0:03:04,000
70 percent tell the truth about their transgression.

61
0:03:04.972,000 --> 0:03:06,000
At three years of age,

62
0:03:07.134,000 --> 0:03:1,000
50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth.

63
0:03:11.302,000 --> 0:03:12,000
At four years of age,

64
0:03:13.225,000 --> 0:03:14,000
more than 80 percent lie.

65
0:03:16.334,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And after four years of age,

66
0:03:18.809,000 --> 0:03:19,000
most children lie.

67
0:03:21.18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So as you can see,

68
0:03:22.567,000 --> 0:03:25,000
lying is really a typical part of development.

69
0:03:26.054,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And some children begin to tell lies

70
0:03:28.868,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as young as two years of age.

71
0:03:32.438,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So now, let's take a closer look at the younger children.

72
0:03:37.336,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Why do some but not all young children lie?

73
0:03:42.184,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In cooking, you need good ingredients

74
0:03:45.537,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to cook good food.

75
0:03:47.793,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And good lying requires two key ingredients.

76
0:03:53.109,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The first key ingredient is theory of mind,

77
0:03:57.243,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or the mind-reading ability.

78
0:03:59.768,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Mind reading is the ability to know

79
0:04:01.87,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that different people have different knowledge about the situation

80
0:04:06.502,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the ability to differentiate between what I know

81
0:04:10.327,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and what you know.

82
0:04:11.914,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Mind reading is important for lying

83
0:04:14.185,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because the basis of lying is that I know

84
0:04:18.056,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you don't know

85
0:04:19.231,000 --> 0:04:2,000
what I know.

86
0:04:20.406,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Therefore, I can lie to you.

87
0:04:23.07,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The second key ingredient for good lying is self-control.

88
0:04:27.704,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression

89
0:04:32.351,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and your body language,

90
0:04:33.915,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so that you can tell a convincing lie.

91
0:04:36.938,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And we found that those young children

92
0:04:40.688,000 --> 0:04:44,000
who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities

93
0:04:45.568,000 --> 0:04:47,000
tell lies earlier

94
0:04:47.63,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and are more sophisticated liars.

95
0:04:51.887,000 --> 0:04:56,000
As it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us

96
0:04:57.53,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to function well in our society.

97
0:05:00.848,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities

98
0:05:05.207,000 --> 0:05:08,000
are associated with serious developmental problems,

99
0:05:08.79,000 --> 0:05:1,000
such as ADHD and autism.

100
0:05:13.893,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie,

101
0:05:19.094,000 --> 0:05:2,000
instead of being alarmed,

102
0:05:21.102,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you should celebrate --

103
0:05:22.618,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:24.164,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone

105
0:05:29.918,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of typical development.

106
0:05:33.085,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, are children poor liars?

107
0:05:36.878,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Do you think you can easily detect their lies?

108
0:05:40.745,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Would you like to give it a try?

109
0:05:42.921,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Yes? OK.

110
0:05:44.425,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I'm going to show you two videos.

111
0:05:47.024,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In the videos,

112
0:05:48.199,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the children are going to respond to a researcher's question,

113
0:05:51.28,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Did you peek?"

114
0:05:52.786,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So try to tell me

115
0:05:54.364,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which child is lying

116
0:05:55.786,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and which child is telling the truth.

117
0:05:58.272,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Here's child number one.

118
0:06:00.991,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Are you ready?

119
0:06:03.006,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

120
0:06:05.619,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.

121
0:06:09.501,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

122
0:06:13.296,000 --> 0:06:16,000
KL: OK, if you think child number one is lying,

123
0:06:16.907,000 --> 0:06:17,000
please raise your hand.

124
0:06:20.401,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand.

125
0:06:25.593,000 --> 0:06:27,000
OK, so as a matter of fact,

126
0:06:28.091,000 --> 0:06:3,000
child number one is telling the truth,

127
0:06:31.052,000 --> 0:06:33,000
child number two is lying.

128
0:06:34.124,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies.

129
0:06:37.378,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:39.88,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, we have played similar kinds of games

131
0:06:43.288,000 --> 0:06:47,000
with many, many adults from all walks of life.

132
0:06:48.714,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And we show them many videos.

133
0:06:51.347,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In half of the videos, the children lied.

134
0:06:53.92,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In the other half of the videos, the children told the truth.

135
0:06:58.529,000 --> 0:07:,000
And let's find out how these adults performed.

136
0:07:02.319,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Because there are as many liars as truth tellers,

137
0:07:06.198,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if you guess randomly,

138
0:07:08.621,000 --> 0:07:12,000
there's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right.

139
0:07:12.715,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,

140
0:07:16.333,000 --> 0:07:19,000
it means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.

141
0:07:20.29,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So let's start with undergrads and law school students,

142
0:07:24.843,000 --> 0:07:27,000
who typically have limited experience with children.

143
0:07:30.038,000 --> 0:07:31,000
No, they cannot detect children's lies.

144
0:07:32.024,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Their performance is around chance.

145
0:07:34.262,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers,

146
0:07:39.515,000 --> 0:07:41,000
who work with children on a daily basis?

147
0:07:42.213,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Can they detect children's lies?

148
0:07:45.624,000 --> 0:07:46,000
No, they cannot.

149
0:07:46.799,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:47.868,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What about judges,

151
0:07:49.364,000 --> 0:07:5,000
customs officers

152
0:07:51.188,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and police officers,

153
0:07:53.07,000 --> 0:07:55,000
who deal with liars on a daily basis?

154
0:07:55.737,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Can they detect children's lies?

155
0:07:58.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
No, they cannot.

156
0:08:00.43,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What about parents?

157
0:08:01.64,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Can parents detect other children's lies?

158
0:08:05.898,000 --> 0:08:06,000
No, they cannot.

159
0:08:07.821,000 --> 0:08:1,000
What about, can parents detect their own children's lies?

160
0:08:13.208,000 --> 0:08:14,000
No, they cannot.

161
0:08:14.433,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

162
0:08:17.933,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So now you may ask

163
0:08:20.504,000 --> 0:08:23,000
why children's lies are so difficult to detect.

164
0:08:24.958,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Let me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan.

165
0:08:27.994,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is his facial expression

166
0:08:30.187,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when he lies.

167
0:08:31.595,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:33.825,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So when children lie,

169
0:08:35.451,000 --> 0:08:38,000
their facial expression is typically neutral.

170
0:08:39.123,000 --> 0:08:42,000
However, behind this neutral expression,

171
0:08:42.607,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions,

172
0:08:45.957,000 --> 0:08:48,000
such as fear, guilt, shame

173
0:08:49.836,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.

174
0:08:52.956,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:55.682,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Unfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden.

176
0:09:00.546,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.

177
0:09:03.669,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So in the last five years,

178
0:09:05.052,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions.

179
0:09:08.972,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Then we made a discovery.

180
0:09:11.273,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We know that underneath our facial skin,

181
0:09:14.482,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there's a rich network of blood vessels.

182
0:09:17.9,000 --> 0:09:19,000
When we experience different emotions,

183
0:09:20.341,000 --> 0:09:22,000
our facial blood flow changes subtly.

184
0:09:23.613,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And these changes are regulated by the autonomic system

185
0:09:27.585,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that is beyond our conscious control.

186
0:09:30.159,000 --> 0:09:33,000
By looking at facial blood flow changes,

187
0:09:34.006,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we can reveal people's hidden emotions.

188
0:09:37.229,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Unfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes

189
0:09:42.031,000 --> 0:09:44,000
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

190
0:09:45.632,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So to help us reveal people's facial emotions,

191
0:09:49.424,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we have developed a new imaging technology

192
0:09:52.482,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we call "transdermal optical imaging."

193
0:09:56.679,000 --> 0:09:59,000
To do so, we use a regular video camera to record people

194
0:10:00.656,000 --> 0:10:03,000
when they experience various hidden emotions.

195
0:10:04.385,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then, using our image processing technology,

196
0:10:08.503,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes.

197
0:10:16.475,000 --> 0:10:2,000
By looking at transdermal video images,

198
0:10:20.771,000 --> 0:10:21,000
now we can easily see

199
0:10:23.737,000 --> 0:10:28,000
facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions.

200
0:10:29.944,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And using this technology,

201
0:10:31.756,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying,

202
0:10:36.448,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and therefore detect people's lies.

203
0:10:39.382,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We can do so noninvasively,

204
0:10:41.845,000 --> 0:10:43,000
remotely, inexpensively,

205
0:10:44.408,000 --> 0:10:47,000
with an accuracy at about 85 percent,

206
0:10:48.092,000 --> 0:10:5,000
which is far better than chance level.

207
0:10:51.1,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect.

208
0:10:56.336,000 --> 0:10:58,000
No, not this Pinocchio effect.

209
0:10:58.415,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:59.446,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is the real Pinocchio effect.

211
0:11:01.592,000 --> 0:11:02,000
When people lie,

212
0:11:03.033,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases,

213
0:11:06.836,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and the facial blood flow on the nose increases.

214
0:11:11.379,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Of course, lying is not the only situation

215
0:11:14.91,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that will evoke our hidden emotions.

216
0:11:17.782,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So then we asked ourselves,

217
0:11:19.68,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in addition to detecting lies,

218
0:11:22.051,000 --> 0:11:24,000
how can our technology be used?

219
0:11:25.027,000 --> 0:11:28,000
One application is in education.

220
0:11:28.597,000 --> 0:11:32,000
For example, using this technology, we can help this mathematics teacher

221
0:11:33.282,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to identify the student in his classroom

222
0:11:36.213,000 --> 0:11:4,000
who may experience high anxiety about the topic he's teaching

223
0:11:40.982,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so that he can help him.

224
0:11:43.337,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And also we can use this in health care.

225
0:11:46.101,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For example, every day I Skype my parents,

226
0:11:49.493,000 --> 0:11:51,000
who live thousands of miles away.

227
0:11:52.178,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And using this technology,

228
0:11:54.023,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I can not only find out what's going on in their lives

229
0:11:57.529,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level,

230
0:12:03.855,000 --> 0:12:06,000
their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain.

231
0:12:07.839,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And perhaps in the future,

232
0:12:09.673,000 --> 0:12:12,000
their risks for heart attack or hypertension.

233
0:12:13.701,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And you may ask:

234
0:12:15.472,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Can we use this also to reveal politicians' emotions?

235
0:12:20.977,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

236
0:12:22.541,000 --> 0:12:23,000
For example, during a debate.

237
0:12:25.22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Well, the answer is yes.

238
0:12:27.167,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Using TV footage,

239
0:12:29.135,000 --> 0:12:33,000
we could detect the politicians' heart rate,

240
0:12:33.205,000 --> 0:12:35,000
mood and stress,

241
0:12:35.275,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us.

242
0:12:39.495,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We can also use this in marketing research,

243
0:12:42.515,000 --> 0:12:43,000
for example, to find out

244
0:12:44.39,000 --> 0:12:48,000
whether or not people like certain consumer products.

245
0:12:49.229,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We can even use it in dating.

246
0:12:51.904,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So for example,

247
0:12:53.088,000 --> 0:12:55,000
if your date is smiling at you,

248
0:12:55.706,000 --> 0:12:57,000
this technology can help you to determine

249
0:12:58.524,000 --> 0:13:,000
whether she actually likes you

250
0:13:01.155,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or she is just trying to be nice to you.

251
0:13:03.864,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And in this case,

252
0:13:05.583,000 --> 0:13:06,000
she is just trying to be nice to you.

253
0:13:07.483,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Laughter)

254
0:13:11.244,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So transdermal optical imaging technology

255
0:13:14.977,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is at a very early stage of development.

256
0:13:17.579,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Many new applications will come about that we don't know today.

257
0:13:22.293,000 --> 0:13:24,000
However, one thing I know for sure

258
0:13:25.095,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is that lying will never be the same again.

259
0:13:28.533,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you very much.

260
0:13:29.715,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Xiè xie.

261
0:13:31.063,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Applause)

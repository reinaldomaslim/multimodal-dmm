1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:15,000
A year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

2
0:00:16.365,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to present our art projects.

3
0:00:18.999,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us.

4
0:00:23.586,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.

5
0:00:26.451,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It is the only old building in the government district

6
0:00:29.443,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that was not destroyed during the Second World War,

7
0:00:32.423,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery.

8
0:00:35.723,000 --> 0:00:39,000
No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.

9
0:00:39.863,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:42.656,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag --

11
0:00:46.499,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Germany's parliament -- and the Brandenburg Gate,

12
0:00:49.334,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and right next to the gate there are other embassies,

13
0:00:52.299,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in particular the US and the British Embassy.

14
0:00:56.657,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Although Germany is an advanced democracy,

15
0:00:59.897,000 --> 0:01:01,000
citizens are limited in their constitutional rights

16
0:01:02.882,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in its government district.

17
0:01:04.299,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there.

18
0:01:09.607,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And this is interesting from an artistic point of view.

19
0:01:13.299,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself

20
0:01:18.035,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are always bound to a certain order

21
0:01:20.299,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and always subject to a specific regulation.

22
0:01:23.798,000 --> 0:01:27,000
With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations,

23
0:01:28.581,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we can gain a new perspective.

24
0:01:31.299,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions

25
0:01:35.977,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and our lives.

26
0:01:38.168,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And this is crucial in another context.

27
0:01:41.299,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Over the last couple of years,

28
0:01:42.801,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy,

29
0:01:47.299,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the secret services have been listening to the entire district,

30
0:01:52.06,000 --> 0:01:54,000
including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel.

31
0:01:55.299,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome,

32
0:02:00.299,000 --> 0:02:03,000
while the listening post of the American NSA

33
0:02:03.34,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is covered by radio transparent screens.

34
0:02:07.342,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But how to address these hidden and disguised forces?

35
0:02:10.903,000 --> 0:02:12,000
With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,

36
0:02:13.299,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy.

37
0:02:16.783,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.

38
0:02:22.508,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If people are spying on us, it stands to reason

39
0:02:25.674,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that they have to listen to what we are saying.

40
0:02:28.299,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:32.299,000 --> 0:02:36,000
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas.

42
0:02:38.729,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.

43
0:02:43.007,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:44.298,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They were makeshift can antennas,

45
0:02:46.045,000 --> 0:02:48,000
not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible.

46
0:02:50.299,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The Academy of Arts joined the project,

47
0:02:52.818,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop,

48
0:02:56.532,000 --> 0:03:,000
exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.

49
0:03:00.574,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:02.454,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation.

51
0:03:07.299,000 --> 0:03:09,000
A helicopter circled over our heads

52
0:03:09.575,000 --> 0:03:12,000
with a camera registering each and every move we made,

53
0:03:12.829,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled.

54
0:03:17.499,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Although the government district is governed by a strict police order,

55
0:03:22.712,000 --> 0:03:26,000
there are no specific laws relating to digital communication.

56
0:03:27.548,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Our installation was therefore perfectly legal,

57
0:03:31.055,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it.

58
0:03:35.101,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"

59
0:03:38.004,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:40.805,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network

61
0:03:45.09,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate

62
0:03:48.299,000 --> 0:03:51,000
using any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance,

63
0:03:51.435,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and be able to send messages

64
0:03:53.38,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted.

65
0:03:58.51,000 --> 0:04:,000
Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --

66
0:04:01.029,000 --> 0:04:03,000
anything could be sent anonymously.

67
0:04:04.852,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And people did communicate.

68
0:04:07.299,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Over 15,000 messages were sent.

69
0:04:10.299,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Here are some examples.

70
0:04:13.299,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ."

71
0:04:19.208,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"

72
0:04:24.884,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!"

73
0:04:28.612,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:32.233,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations.

75
0:04:36.299,000 --> 0:04:38,000
# expect us. We will #shutdown"

76
0:04:39.483,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."

77
0:04:42.967,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"

78
0:04:48.454,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike."

79
0:04:52.894,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:56.529,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Make Love, Not cyberwar."

81
0:04:59.602,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We invited the embassies and the government departments

82
0:05:02.299,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to participate in the open network, too,

83
0:05:05.129,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and to our surprise, they did.

84
0:05:07.066,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Files appeared on the network, including classified documents

85
0:05:10.01,000 --> 0:05:12,000
leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission,

86
0:05:12.652,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information

87
0:05:16.366,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament.

88
0:05:21.746,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out

89
0:05:25.092,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the power constellations on-site.

90
0:05:27.166,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies,

91
0:05:30.527,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.

92
0:05:36.299,000 --> 0:05:4,000
If we become aware of the constellation,

93
0:05:40.502,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the terms and conditions of communication,

94
0:05:43.322,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it not only broadens our horizon,

95
0:05:45.677,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview,

96
0:05:49.573,000 --> 0:05:53,000
our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.

97
0:05:54.461,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Let's look at an actual example.

98
0:05:57.383,000 --> 0:06:,000
The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements

99
0:06:00.494,000 --> 0:06:01,000
on the outskirts of Paris

100
0:06:02.245,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is hidden and faded from view.

101
0:06:05.299,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's a vicious circle.

102
0:06:07.299,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new.

103
0:06:10.575,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What is new is how these realities are hidden

104
0:06:14.117,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and how people are made invisible

105
0:06:15.769,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange.

106
0:06:20.595,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal,

107
0:06:23.454,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and therefore those living in them don't have a chance

108
0:06:26.75,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of making their voices heard.

109
0:06:28.575,000 --> 0:06:33,000
On the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible,

110
0:06:34.025,000 --> 0:06:36,000
merely gives grounds for further persecution,

111
0:06:36.759,000 --> 0:06:38,000
expulsion and suppression.

112
0:06:38.792,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side.

113
0:06:44.02,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We were searching for an interface and we found one.

114
0:06:47.433,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.

115
0:06:51.72,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We named the project "Hotel Gelem."

116
0:06:54.783,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Together with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,

117
0:06:58.64,000 --> 0:07:,000
for example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris,

118
0:07:01.623,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and also in the Balkans.

119
0:07:03.299,000 --> 0:07:04,000
These are real hotels.

120
0:07:04.684,000 --> 0:07:05,000
People can stay there.

121
0:07:06.299,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But they aren't a commercial enterprise.

122
0:07:08.299,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They are a symbol.

123
0:07:10.575,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You can go online and ask for a personal invitation

124
0:07:14.251,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,

125
0:07:18.661,000 --> 0:07:21,000
eating, working and living with the Roma families.

126
0:07:22.748,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Here, the Roma families are not the travelers;

127
0:07:25.939,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the visitors are.

128
0:07:27.584,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Here, the Roma families are not a minority;

129
0:07:30.663,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the visitors are.

130
0:07:33.833,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The point is not to make judgments,

131
0:07:37.826,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but rather to find out about the context that determines

132
0:07:40.604,000 --> 0:07:43,000
these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions.

133
0:07:44.299,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the world of globalization,

134
0:07:46.563,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the continents are drifting closer to each other.

135
0:07:49.299,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Cultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange,

136
0:07:51.847,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged

137
0:07:55.125,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the world of the excluded is growing.

138
0:07:59.591,000 --> 0:08:,000
We were recently in Australia.

139
0:08:01.299,000 --> 0:08:03,000
For us, it was no problem to enter the country.

140
0:08:03.924,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We have European passports, visas and air tickets.

141
0:08:07.059,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia

142
0:08:10.785,000 --> 0:08:12,000
are deported or taken to prison.

143
0:08:13.299,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The interception of the boats

144
0:08:14.798,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and the disappearance of the people into the detention system

145
0:08:17.903,000 --> 0:08:19,000
are veiled by the Australian authorities.

146
0:08:21.062,000 --> 0:08:24,000
These procedures are declared to be secret military operations.

147
0:08:25.768,000 --> 0:08:28,000
After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones,

148
0:08:28.936,000 --> 0:08:32,000
men, women and children are detained by Australia without trial,

149
0:08:33.071,000 --> 0:08:34,000
sometimes for years.

150
0:08:37.036,000 --> 0:08:39,000
During our stay, however,

151
0:08:39.156,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,

152
0:08:43.299,000 --> 0:08:45,000
despite strict screening and isolation.

153
0:08:46.057,000 --> 0:08:5,000
From these contexts was born an installation in the art space

154
0:08:50.19,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.

155
0:08:54.635,000 --> 0:08:57,000
On the face of it, it was a very simple installation.

156
0:08:58.182,000 --> 0:09:01,000
On the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction

157
0:09:01.611,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to each immigration detention center,

158
0:09:03.643,000 --> 0:09:07,000
accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility.

159
0:09:08.299,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity.

160
0:09:12.642,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Above every floor marking, there was a headset.

161
0:09:16.299,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee

162
0:09:20.939,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who was or had been imprisoned

163
0:09:23.299,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in a specific detention facility

164
0:09:25.511,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and engage in a personal conversation.

165
0:09:28.916,000 --> 0:09:3,000
In the protected context of the art exhibition,

166
0:09:31.806,000 --> 0:09:33,000
asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves,

167
0:09:34.457,000 --> 0:09:37,000
their story and their situation, without fear of consequences.

168
0:09:38.694,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations

169
0:09:41.73,000 --> 0:09:44,000
about families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones,

170
0:09:45.507,000 --> 0:09:46,000
about suicide attempts,

171
0:09:47.143,000 --> 0:09:49,000
about the fate of children in detention.

172
0:09:50.618,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Emotions ran deep. Many wept.

173
0:09:52.626,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Several revisited the exhibition.

174
0:09:55.032,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It was a powerful experience.

175
0:09:58.459,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.

176
0:10:03.413,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies

177
0:10:07.299,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and the temptation of militarized responses.

178
0:10:11.299,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We have also established communication systems

179
0:10:14.013,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece.

180
0:10:17.622,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They are all about providing basic information -- weather forecasts,

181
0:10:20.877,000 --> 0:10:21,000
legal information, guidance.

182
0:10:23.163,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But they are significant.

183
0:10:25.211,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Information on the Internet

184
0:10:26.553,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that could ensure survival along dangerous routes

185
0:10:29.307,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is being censored,

186
0:10:30.724,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.

187
0:10:36.601,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This brings us back to our network and to the antennas

188
0:10:39.675,000 --> 0:10:41,000
on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

189
0:10:41.929,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.

190
0:10:44.725,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected.

191
0:10:47.959,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We should start making our own connections,

192
0:10:50.016,000 --> 0:10:54,000
fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world.

193
0:10:54.54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is essential to overcome our speechlessness

194
0:10:57.299,000 --> 0:11:,000
and the separation provoked by rival political forces.

195
0:11:00.839,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It is only in truly exposing ourselves

196
0:11:04.054,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to the transformative power of this experience

197
0:11:06.944,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.

198
0:11:10.299,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thank you.

199
0:11:11.477,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

200
0:11:16.835,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.

201
0:11:18.546,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The other half of your artistic duo is also here.

202
0:11:20.895,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Christoph Wachter, come onstage.

203
0:11:22.556,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause)

204
0:11:27.938,000 --> 0:11:28,000
First, tell me just a detail:

205
0:11:29.367,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the name of the hotel is not a random name.

206
0:11:31.47,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Gelem means something specific in the Roma language.

207
0:11:34.755,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem" is the title of the Romani hymn,

208
0:11:39.597,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the official, and it means "I went a long way."

209
0:11:42.98,000 --> 0:11:44,000
BG: That's just to add the detail to your talk.

210
0:11:45.223,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos

211
0:11:47.931,000 --> 0:11:49,000
very recently, you're just back a couple of days ago,

212
0:11:50.646,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving

213
0:11:53.078,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and have been arriving over the last few months.

214
0:11:55.39,000 --> 0:11:57,000
What did you see there and what did you do there?

215
0:11:57.856,000 --> 0:12:,000
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey,

216
0:12:01.681,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and during our stay,

217
0:12:03.1,000 --> 0:12:08,000
many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies,

218
0:12:08.545,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and after landing, they were left completely on their own.

219
0:12:12.228,000 --> 0:12:15,000
They are denied many services.

220
0:12:16.043,000 --> 0:12:18,000
For example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket

221
0:12:18.561,000 --> 0:12:19,000
or to rent a hotel room,

222
0:12:19.99,000 --> 0:12:23,000
so many families literally sleep in the streets.

223
0:12:24.7,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And we installed networks there to allow basic communication,

224
0:12:29.36,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because I think, I believe,

225
0:12:31.487,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees,

226
0:12:36.95,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I think we need to start talking to them.

227
0:12:40.655,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings,

228
0:12:44.299,000 --> 0:12:46,000
about their lives and their struggle to survive.

229
0:12:47.086,000 --> 0:12:48,000
BG: And allow them to talk as well.

230
0:12:49.02,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.

231
0:12:50.959,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Mathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story.

232
0:12:54.001,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

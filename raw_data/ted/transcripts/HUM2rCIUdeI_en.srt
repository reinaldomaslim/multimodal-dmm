1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was the early '90s,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I was at a public event.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I saw this leaflet and it said,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"There are millions of slaves in the world today."

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I thought, "No way, no way."

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I'm going to admit to hubris.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Because I also, I'm going to admit to you,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I also thought, "How can I be like

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a hot-shot young full professor

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who teaches human rights and not know this?

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So it can't be true."

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Well, if you teach, if you worship

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the temple of learning,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
do not mock the gods,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because they will take you,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
fill you with curiosity and desire,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and drive you. Drive you with a passion

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to change things.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I went out and did a lit review,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
All the rest were historical.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal --

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
no solid information.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So, I began to do a research project of my own.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I went to five countries around the world.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I looked very deeply

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
into slave-based businesses

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because this is an economic crime.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
People do not enslave people to be mean to them.

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They do it to make a profit.

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in four different continents,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
was depressingly familiar.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Like this:

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Agricultural workers in Africa,

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
whipped and beaten,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
showing us how they were beaten in the fields

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
before they escaped from slavery

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and met up with our film crew.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It was mind-blowing.

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I want to be very clear.

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'm talking about real slavery.

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This is not about lousy marriages,

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
this is not about jobs that suck.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is about people who can not walk away,

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
people who are forced to work without pay,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
people who are operating 24/7

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
under a threat of violence

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and have no pay.

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's real slavery in exactly the same way

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that slavery would be recognized

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
throughout all of human history.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, where is it?

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are the places with the highest densities of slavery.

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But in fact that kind of bluey color

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where we can't find any cases of enslavement

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
around the world.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We're also particularly interested

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and looking very carefully

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
at places where

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
slaves are being used to perpetrate

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
extreme environmental destruction.

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,

72
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
forest areas in West Africa;

74
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
mining and spreading mercury around

75
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in places like Ghana and the Congo;

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's a pretty harrowing linkage

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
between what's happening to our environment

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and what's happening to our human rights.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where we have 27 million people

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in slavery in the year 2010?

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
That's double the number that came out of Africa

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in the entire transatlantic slave trade.

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Well, it builds up with these factors.

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
One we all know about, the population explosion:

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the world goes from two billion people to almost

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
seven billion people in the last 50 years.

90
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Being numerous does not make you a slave.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in the developing world,

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.

95
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We understand how that works. In some countries

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
all of those things happen at once,

97
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like Sierra Leone a few years ago,

98
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as we know, live on the edge,

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
live in situations where

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But that doesn't make you a slave either.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable

104
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If the rule of law is sound, it protects

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the poor and it protects the vulnerable.

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But if corruption creeps in

108
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and people don't have the opportunity

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to have that protection of the rule of law,

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
then if you can use violence,

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if you can use violence with impunity,

112
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
into slavery.

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world.

115
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Though, for a lot of people,

116
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the people who step

117
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
into slavery today

118
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.

119
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They come into slavery because

120
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
someone has asked them this question.

121
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
All around the world I've been told an almost identical story.

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
People say, "I was home,

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
someone came into our village,

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who needs a job?'"

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And they did exactly what

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you or I would do in the same situation.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but my children were hungry.

130
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We needed medicine.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I knew I had to do anything I could

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to earn some money to support the people I care about."

133
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.

134
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,

135
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.

136
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They take it for a little while,

137
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,

138
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and they discover they're enslaved.

139
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now, that kind of slavery

140
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.

141
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable

142
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and novel about slavery today,

143
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that is a complete collapse

144
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the price of human beings --

145
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
expensive in the past, dirt cheap now.

146
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Even the business programs have started

147
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
picking up on this.

148
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I just want to share a little clip for you.

149
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,

150
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as we get macro and talk commodities.

151
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,

152
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.

153
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And we're also joined by Brent Lawson

154
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
from Lawson Frisk Securities.

155
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.

156
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
D: Good to have you with us, Brent.

157
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?

158
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently

159
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and casting our net just a little bit wider.

160
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We really like the human being story a lot.

161
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
If you look at a long-term chart,

162
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
prices are at historical lows and yet global demand

163
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for forced labor is still real strong.

164
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.

165
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?

166
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
as an asset is the endless supply.

168
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.

169
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.

170
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That is that private equity has been sniffing around,

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and that tells me that this market is about to explode.

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Africans and Indians, as usual,

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
are on our buy list.

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
MO: We're recommending to our clients

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a buy and hold strategy.

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's no need to play the market.

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.

180
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.

181
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.

182
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Though I enjoyed watching

183
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.

184
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,

185
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and they've been slipping it in between music videos

186
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.

187
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Here's the reality.

188
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years

189
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.

190
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Capital purchase items.

191
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.

192
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The average price of a human being today,

193
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
around the world, is about 90 dollars.

194
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They are more expensive in places like North America.

195
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,

196
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but I could take you places in India or Nepal

197
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.

198
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They key here is that

199
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
people have ceased to be that capital purchase item

200
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and become like Styrofoam cups.

201
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You buy them cheaply, you use them,

202
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you crumple them up, and then when you're done

203
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
with them you just throw them away.

204
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
These young boys are in Nepal.

205
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They are basically the transport system

206
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
on a quarry run by a slaveholder.

207
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone

208
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on their backs, often of their own weight,

209
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
up and down the Himalaya Mountains.

210
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
One of their mothers said to us,

211
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
"You know, we can't survive here,

212
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but we can't even seem to die either."

213
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's a horrible situation.

214
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,

215
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it's that there are also --

216
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved --

217
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.

218
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.

219
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I don't know if you've ever had a daydream

220
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
about, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?

221
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"

222
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job

223
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is that I get to,

224
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and I want to introduce you to one of those.

225
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana

226
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
enslaved in the fishing industry,

227
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and he now, after escape and building a new life,

228
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
has formed an organization that we work closely with

229
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to go back and get people out of slavery.

230
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.

231
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle

232
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the head. And this reminds me

233
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of my childhood when I used to work here.

234
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
KB: James and our country director in Ghana,

235
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats

236
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because the two of them managed to get

237
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers

238
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
for the very first time in Ghana

239
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for enslaving people, from the fishing industry,

240
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for enslaving children.

241
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, everything I've been telling you,

242
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I admit, is pretty disheartening.

243
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But there is actually a very positive side to this,

244
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and that is this: The 27 million people

245
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
who are in slavery today,

246
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that's a lot of people, but it's also

247
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the smallest fraction

248
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
of the global population to ever be in slavery.

249
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate

250
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
into the global economy each year

251
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is the tiniest proportion of the global economy

252
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to ever be represented by slave labor.

253
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Slavery, illegal in every country

254
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
has been pushed to the edges of our global society.

255
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And in a way, without us even noticing,

256
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
has ended up standing on the precipice

257
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of its own extinction,

258
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
waiting for us to give it a big boot

259
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and knock it over. And get rid of it.

260
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it can be done.

261
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources

262
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the focus to it,

263
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?

264
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost

265
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I've got to be absolutely clear.

266
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We do not buy people out of slavery.

267
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Buying people out of slavery is like

268
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
paying a burglar to get your television back;

269
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it's abetting a crime.

270
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Liberation, however, costs some money.

271
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Liberation, and more importantly

272
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
all the work that comes after liberation.

273
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's not an event, it's a process.

274
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's about helping people to build lives of dignity,

275
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
stability, economic autonomy,

276
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
citizenship.

277
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well, amazingly,

278
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in places like India where costs are very low,

279
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that family, that three-generation family that you see there

280
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
who were in hereditary slavery --

281
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery --

282
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but the total cost, amortized

283
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
across the rest of the work,

284
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
was about 150 dollars to bring that family

285
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
out of slavery and then take them through a two year process

286
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to build a stable life of citizenship and education.

287
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.

288
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
In the United States, North America,

289
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...

290
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we understand that it's expensive here:

291
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
about 30,000 dollars.

292
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But most of the people in the world in slavery

293
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
live in those places where

294
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the costs are lowest.

295
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And in fact, the global average is about what it is

296
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
for Ghana.

297
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And that means, when you multiply it up,

298
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the estimated cost of

299
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
not just freedom but sustainable freedom

300
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery

301
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is something like 10.8 billion dollars --

302
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,

303
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:

304
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,

305
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or in the last holiday period

306
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,

307
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
we spent 10.8 billion dollars.

308
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.

309
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
It's not a lot of money at the global level.

310
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
In fact, it's peanuts.

311
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And the great thing about it is that

312
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it's not money down a hole,

313
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery

314
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to work for themselves,

315
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
are they motivated?

316
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They take their kids out of the workplace,

317
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
they build a school, they say,

318
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,

319
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
medicine when we're sick,

320
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
clothing when we're cold."

321
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They become consumers and producers

322
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.

323
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
That's important, all of that

324
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
about how we rebuild sustainable freedom,

325
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because we'd never want to repeat

326
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
what happened in this country in 1865.

327
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Four million people were lifted up out of slavery

328
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and then dumped.

329
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Dumped without political participation,

330
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
decent education,

331
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
any kind of real opportunity

332
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in terms of economic lives,

333
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and then sentenced to generations of

334
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
violence and prejudice and discrimination.

335
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And America is still paying the price

336
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
for the botched emancipation of 1865.

337
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We have made a commitment

338
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that we will never let people

339
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
come out of slavery on our watch,

340
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and end up as second class citizens.

341
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
It's just not going to happen.

342
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
This is what liberation really looks like.

343
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,

344
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
reunited with their parents,

345
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and then taken with their parents back to their villages

346
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to rebuild their economic well-being

347
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
so that they become slave-proof --

348
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
absolutely unenslaveable.

349
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Now, this woman

350
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
lived in a village in Nepal.

351
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We'd been working there about a month.

352
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.

353
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
They'd just begun to light up a little bit,

354
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
open up a little bit.

355
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,

356
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the slaveholders were still menacing us

357
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.

358
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I was frightened. We were frightened.

359
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"

360
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
She said, "No, because we've got hope now.

361
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
How could we not succeed," she said,

362
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"when people like you from the other side of the world

363
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
are coming here to stand beside us?"

364
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Okay, we have to ask ourselves,

365
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
are we willing to live in a world with slavery?

366
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open

367
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to have someone else jerk the strings

368
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that tie us to slavery in the products we buy,

369
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and in our government policies.

370
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,

371
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I think it's that slavery should end.

372
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And if there is a fundamental violation

373
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
of our human dignity

374
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that we would all say is horrific,

375
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
it's slavery.

376
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And we've got to say,

377
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
what good is all of our intellectual

378
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and political and economic power --

379
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room --

380
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?

381
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I think there is enough intellectual power in this room

382
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to bring slavery to an end.

383
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And you know what? If we can't do that,

384
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,

385
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
there is one last question:

386
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Are we truly free?

387
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Okay, thank you so much.

388
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

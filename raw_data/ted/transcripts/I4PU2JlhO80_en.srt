2
0:00:12.323,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'll tell you a little bit about my story and who I am.

3
0:00:14.788,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm a fashion photographer based in New York City.

4
0:00:17.436,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've worked for lots of different magazines in New York,

5
0:00:20.258,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire,

6
0:00:25.056,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and for Interview and for GQ,

7
0:00:26.998,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I got to work with some really beautiful people.

8
0:00:29.505,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My studio is in New York,

9
0:00:30.826,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I also lived in Milan for about eight years,

10
0:00:33.047,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and in Paris as well,

11
0:00:34.746,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and worked for the house of Yves St. Laurent.

12
0:00:37.644,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I also did portraiture as well.

13
0:00:42.475,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I've worked for lots of different magazines,

14
0:00:44.904,000 --> 0:00:45,000
lots of great clients.

15
0:00:46.653,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But I was always told, every single day, who was beautiful.

16
0:00:49.294,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was forced to work

17
0:00:50.826,000 --> 0:00:52,000
within certain parameters of the beauty standard.

18
0:00:53.268,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was told, "This is the most amazing model of the moment,

19
0:00:55.841,000 --> 0:00:56,000
you've got to photograph her.

20
0:00:57.227,000 --> 0:00:59,000
She's incredible, you've got to."

21
0:00:59.305,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And then the next season, it would change again,

22
0:01:01.421,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I'd have to shift my ideas of beauty,

23
0:01:03.768,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and so we'd go to the next model,

24
0:01:05.474,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and it was kind of really crazy, because I'm an artist.

25
0:01:08.205,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I saw beauty everywhere.

26
0:01:09.849,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I didn't see beauty just on a magazine cover.

27
0:01:12.769,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I did a shoot with, of course, Cindy, for Revlon,

28
0:01:15.764,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and really fantastic, beautiful people.

29
0:01:18.602,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But I thought,

30
0:01:19.888,000 --> 0:01:21,000
someone's always telling me who's beautiful.

31
0:01:22.59,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I was kind of frustrated.

32
0:01:24.086,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I left my studio one afternoon in New York,

33
0:01:25.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I was walking down Park Avenue,

34
0:01:27.461,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I saw, waiting for a bus at the corner of Park and 20th,

35
0:01:30.552,000 --> 0:01:32,000
this gorgeous kid.

36
0:01:32.593,000 --> 0:01:35,000
She had long, white, beautiful hair, and pale, pale skin.

37
0:01:36.406,000 --> 0:01:38,000
She had a genetic condition called albinism.

38
0:01:39.109,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I didn't know much about it, but she was stunning,

39
0:01:40.939,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I'd never met a model like this before.

40
0:01:42.721,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I went to grab her and say,

41
0:01:44.281,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"I have to take your photograph, you're amazing!"

42
0:01:46.431,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And the bus came, she got on, and then she took off,

43
0:01:48.392,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I was really glad because she was 12,

44
0:01:50.413,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and I'd be in prison at the moment. (Laughter)

45
0:01:52.324,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But really, it was extraordinary to see this kid.

46
0:01:55.057,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So I continued right down to Union Square,

47
0:01:57.505,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to the huge Barnes and Noble,

48
0:01:58.916,000 --> 0:02:,000
and started pulling any books, or any information I could

49
0:02:01.548,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about this genetic condition, albinism.

50
0:02:03.644,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I found really kind of sad images.

51
0:02:05.975,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I didn't find images of this kid.

52
0:02:07.673,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I found images of people sitting in hospital beds, looking sad,

53
0:02:11.171,000 --> 0:02:14,000
looking downtrodden, just images of despair.

54
0:02:14.742,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I found images of a bright red eye, the albino eye.

55
0:02:18.105,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I'm thinking, this kid had beautiful blue eyes,

56
0:02:20.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
she didn't have red eyes.

57
0:02:21.785,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And then I started seeing images from Africa,

58
0:02:23.812,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where kids were surrounded by tribes pointing spears at them

59
0:02:27.322,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or in cancer wards and clinics,

60
0:02:29.261,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or they're just in beds, and images of illness,

61
0:02:32.114,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of sadness, of sickness.

62
0:02:34.107,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And then, I started, of course,

63
0:02:35.661,000 --> 0:02:36,000
going through those same medical textbooks,

64
0:02:37.161,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and started finding these typical images

65
0:02:39.362,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of kids and adults in their underwear, against walls in doctor's offices,

66
0:02:42.996,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with the black bar across their eyes saying "disease."

67
0:02:46.118,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is a disease, defined by a disease.

68
0:02:48.572,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I was like, this is crazy.

69
0:02:51.186,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then I started going into it further,

70
0:02:52.964,000 --> 0:02:53,000
looking on the Internet,

71
0:02:54.308,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and all these different medical textbooks,

72
0:02:56.068,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and everything was so sad, and so negative.

73
0:02:58.978,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I then started finding images of the albino freak family in the circus,

74
0:03:03.125,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and then of course, all the movie references,

75
0:03:05.145,000 --> 0:03:09,000
from "Powder," who had albinism because his mother was struck by lightning,

76
0:03:09.835,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to "The Princess Bride" and to "The Matrix Reloaded,"

77
0:03:13.467,000 --> 0:03:15,000
there were the ghost-like twins that came in and wreaked havoc,

78
0:03:16.157,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and destroyed things and then disappeared.

79
0:03:18.552,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Even most recently, "The Da Vinci Code,"

80
0:03:20.808,000 --> 0:03:22,000
there was like the evil albino driving around Paris at night,

81
0:03:23.698,000 --> 0:03:25,000
killing people, shooting at people.

82
0:03:25.944,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Well, I found out, through my research,

83
0:03:27.949,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that people with albinism have a visual impairment.

84
0:03:30.193,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There's always vision, but they're considered legally blind.

85
0:03:33.507,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So they certainly wouldn't be driving around Paris at night

86
0:03:35.831,000 --> 0:03:37,000
shooting at anybody and expect to hit anything.

87
0:03:37.971,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So I'm thinking, this is crazy.

88
0:03:40.358,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So I contact NOAH.

89
0:03:41.852,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, NOAH is the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation.

90
0:03:46.753,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's a support group for people living with this condition,

91
0:03:49.229,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and their families.

92
0:03:50.575,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I'm like, "Hey, I'm a fashion photographer.

93
0:03:52.611,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Let's show the world the beauty of albinism!"

94
0:03:54.847,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And they said, "Get lost."

95
0:03:56.661,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I'm pretty persistent. I'm like, "Won't you talk to me?"

96
0:03:59.003,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they made it very clear to me

97
0:04:00.934,000 --> 0:04:02,000
about their fears of exploitation,

98
0:04:03.135,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that every time there was a magazine article

99
0:04:04.884,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that came out about a kid with albinism,

100
0:04:06.753,000 --> 0:04:07,000
it was a story about a victim.

101
0:04:08.46,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It was sad, or it was exploitative,

102
0:04:10.915,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or sensational — never positive, always negative.

103
0:04:14.316,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I said, "Okay, well then, what do we do here?"

104
0:04:17.351,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So, let's form a nontraditional partnership —

105
0:04:20.067,000 --> 0:04:22,000
fashion photographer, genetic support group —

106
0:04:22.685,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and we'll work together.

107
0:04:24.092,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And you can keep an eye on me

108
0:04:25.15,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to make sure that we create something positive and powerful,

109
0:04:28.228,000 --> 0:04:3,000
showing the world the beauty of albinism.

110
0:04:30.797,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And they said okay.

111
0:04:31.988,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I was like, fantastic, let's do this!

112
0:04:33.694,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So in walks the first person I'm about to photograph.

113
0:04:35.834,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Her name is Christine, and Christine is a knockout.

114
0:04:39.421,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Long white hair, really tall. She's stunning.

115
0:04:42.196,000 --> 0:04:43,000
She walks into my studio.

116
0:04:43.968,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The way that she walks in, though, instead of this gorgeous girl,

117
0:04:47.005,000 --> 0:04:49,000
she walks in like this, her head's down,

118
0:04:49.538,000 --> 0:04:53,000
shoulders hunched, one-word answers, she looks down, no eye contact.

119
0:04:54.068,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This kid has been teased her whole life because of her difference.

120
0:04:58.02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And it was so apparent in the fact that it left her with zero self-esteem.

121
0:05:03.852,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I'm thinking, oh, this kid is just so fragile.

122
0:05:07.879,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And just the day before, I was shooting Cindy

123
0:05:09.752,000 --> 0:05:11,000
on the same set, in my studio.

124
0:05:11.801,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm thinking well, I have to be so careful with her — no,

125
0:05:15.391,000 --> 0:05:16,000
out of respect for this gorgeous kid,

126
0:05:17.151,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm going to photograph her like I would anybody else.

127
0:05:18.983,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So the fan went on, the music went on,

128
0:05:21.534,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I grabbed a mirror that was next to the set,

129
0:05:23.075,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I held it up to her, and I said

130
0:05:24.992,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Christine, look at yourself. You're magnificent.

131
0:05:29.071,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And she looked in the mirror, and she got it.

132
0:05:31.852,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And she went from this to that.

133
0:05:34.768,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that's our Christine, and she just exploded in front of the set.

134
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:42,000
By the time she left the studio, she was kissing everybody on both cheeks,

135
0:05:42.602,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and saying, "Ciao!" and she was unbelievable.

136
0:05:45.602,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I saw this transformation right in front of the lens,

137
0:05:48.799,000 --> 0:05:5,000
through photography, that she was now transformed,

138
0:05:51.596,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with a powerful and positive sense of who she is.

139
0:05:54.943,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The next day, she goes to school,

140
0:05:56.787,000 --> 0:05:59,000
she's going to change the way her community sees her difference.

141
0:05:59.847,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Instead of walking into that classroom like this,

142
0:06:02.185,000 --> 0:06:03,000
she's walking in like this.

143
0:06:03.608,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So it's all about ambassadors for change.

144
0:06:06.046,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It was extraordinary.

145
0:06:07.104,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And those first images, right after, we did a series of them,

146
0:06:09.894,000 --> 0:06:12,000
using several individuals with this condition,

147
0:06:13.327,000 --> 0:06:16,000
they were in Life magazine in 1998.

148
0:06:16.541,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So it was a while ago.

149
0:06:17.911,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was a cover story, it was a five-page spread.

150
0:06:20.153,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It was really a fantastic editorial. It was great; I loved it.

151
0:06:24.325,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Then we used a lot of the images, though, from Life,

152
0:06:27.632,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and put them in other magazines, magazines worldwide.

153
0:06:30.768,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Magazines in the U.K., in France, in Italy and Canada,

154
0:06:34.435,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and other magazines in the States. It was amazing.

155
0:06:37.237,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So this is from the U.K., Christine again.

156
0:06:39.475,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, and Kristen.

157
0:06:42.351,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's Lauren. We did a campaign for sunglasses.

158
0:06:45.913,000 --> 0:06:47,000
A lot of kids with this condition are photophobic,

159
0:06:48.606,000 --> 0:06:5,000
so they have a real strong light sensitivity.

160
0:06:51.018,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So we thought, perfect for a sunglass campaign.

161
0:06:55.487,000 --> 0:06:57,000
People magazine did a great story.

162
0:06:57.518,000 --> 0:07:,000
So it was circulating, people were saying all this great stuff.

163
0:07:00.586,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It was fantastic.

164
0:07:02.174,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So I was getting calls, though.

165
0:07:03.724,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Getting calls from the U.K., saying, well we just saw this spread,

166
0:07:06.428,000 --> 0:07:09,000
can you come photograph our kids with this condition?

167
0:07:09.725,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We have a support group here, can you come meet our families?

168
0:07:12.253,000 --> 0:07:14,000
People in Africa were calling in the same.

169
0:07:14.37,000 --> 0:07:15,000
New Zealand, can you help us start a support group?

170
0:07:16.342,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'm like, fantastic! This is great! Let's do it!

171
0:07:19.133,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So I would travel in all these places,

172
0:07:21.527,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as I was shooting and doing my commercial work,

173
0:07:23.951,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I was at a local chapter conference in Philadelphia.

174
0:07:26.436,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Small family conference, about 40 families,

175
0:07:28.503,000 --> 0:07:3,000
did my presentation of kids with albinism,

176
0:07:30.934,000 --> 0:07:32,000
this mom came up to me, and she said,

177
0:07:32.947,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"My son Randy, when he was a little boy,

178
0:07:35.281,000 --> 0:07:37,000
he'd come home from school, and I could see the kids were teasing him,

179
0:07:37.848,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and he'd be in tears.

180
0:07:39.225,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone, or a toy truck,

181
0:07:42.313,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and he'd forget about it."

182
0:07:43.655,000 --> 0:07:45,000
She said, "Now he's in high school. He comes home from school,

183
0:07:46.574,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I can see the pain, the anguish in his eyes.

184
0:07:50.018,000 --> 0:07:52,000
He walks in, he walks right past me,

185
0:07:52.914,000 --> 0:07:53,000
goes up to his room, slams the door,

186
0:07:54.482,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I don't see him until the next day.

187
0:07:56.365,000 --> 0:07:57,000
He's not going to want to be photographed,

188
0:07:57.976,000 --> 0:07:58,000
he has zero self-esteem,

189
0:07:59.317,000 --> 0:08:04,000
this kid has such poor body image, and he's just so shy.

190
0:08:04.383,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But if you could just show him photographs of kids his own age,

191
0:08:07.852,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so that he knows he's not alone."

192
0:08:10.068,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I'm like, "Of course. Where is he? Show me!"

193
0:08:12.095,000 --> 0:08:13,000
She points over to Randy.

194
0:08:13.385,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now Randy's sitting there — his pants are hanging down to here,

195
0:08:15.306,000 --> 0:08:17,000
his underwear's hanging out, he has this long, great big shirt,

196
0:08:18.158,000 --> 0:08:21,000
he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo. He's amazing, this kid.

197
0:08:21.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I crawl over to Randy.

198
0:08:22.874,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm like, "Randy, I speak to moms and dads every single day,

199
0:08:26.244,000 --> 0:08:29,000
terrified about the future of their kids with albinism.

200
0:08:29.484,000 --> 0:08:3,000
All they have to do is take one look at you,

201
0:08:31.169,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and they're going to be fine.

202
0:08:32.403,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Please let me take a photo of you.

203
0:08:33.957,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Your mother said, she told me,

204
0:08:35.122,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that you didn't want to be photographed."

205
0:08:36.848,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He said, "Rick, what do you mean?

206
0:08:38.685,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You have to understand, I'm 16 years old.

207
0:08:41.402,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I don't talk to my mother."

208
0:08:43.139,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And then he said, "I want to be photographed.

209
0:08:46.727,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I want to show the world that who I am,

210
0:08:48.784,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with my albinism, but also other things about me —"

211
0:08:50.192,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You see how shy he was.

212
0:08:51.686,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Very, very shy, Randy.

213
0:08:53.183,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But Randy created, early days in this idea,

214
0:08:55.895,000 --> 0:08:57,000
of this nonprofit group Positive Exposure,

215
0:08:58.027,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the idea of networking stories,

216
0:08:59.549,000 --> 0:09:02,000
sharing experiences and the images around the world.

217
0:09:02.939,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I'll kind of quickly go through the album.

218
0:09:05.419,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I was very interested, at that point,

219
0:09:07.192,000 --> 0:09:09,000
getting calls from everybody in the world,

220
0:09:09.251,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to find out more about this idea, a message, about albinism,

221
0:09:12.559,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or perceptions of people in communities about this syndrome, albinism.

222
0:09:16.795,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So I started hearing about stigmas, and discrimination,

223
0:09:20.322,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so what I looked at is really trying to explore cultural perceptions

224
0:09:23.695,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and attitudes towards this condition.

225
0:09:26.221,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is my friend [unclear], who's a Kuna Indian

226
0:09:28.928,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in the San Blas region of the world,

227
0:09:31.268,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the San Blas region of Panama.

228
0:09:34.602,000 --> 0:09:35,000
She's extraordinary.

229
0:09:36.064,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So the incidence of albinism is about one in 20,000 worldwide.

230
0:09:39.618,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, the highest incidence in the world.

231
0:09:44.858,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We went to Fiji, actually, where we found out at the turn of the 19th century,

232
0:09:48.458,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a tribe could not hold their territory

233
0:09:50.767,000 --> 0:09:54,000
unless they had somebody with albinism in a powerful political position.

234
0:09:55.225,000 --> 0:09:57,000
My great friend Keke, I photographed in New Zealand,

235
0:09:58.022,000 --> 0:10:,000
she's from India, from Delhi,

236
0:10:00.769,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but her family left Delhi because she was getting death threats.

237
0:10:04.037,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Now I'm thinking, this is horrible that they had to move,

238
0:10:06.295,000 --> 0:10:07,000
because she's eight years old.

239
0:10:07.733,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And we actually started a support group in Delhi,

240
0:10:10.072,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we found out that there are many kids that we worked with in their communities,

241
0:10:12.946,000 --> 0:10:13,000
after we started this group in India,

242
0:10:14.829,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that have had really positive experiences.

243
0:10:17.078,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So one of the things we want to make very clear

244
0:10:19.137,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is that we're not making generalizations

245
0:10:21.099,000 --> 0:10:22,000
about a community or a culture,

246
0:10:22.611,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and their reaction to people that are different.

247
0:10:24.545,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Keke's experiences were very different,

248
0:10:26.235,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but we've met many kids there

249
0:10:27.827,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that have been embraced by their communities throughout India.

250
0:10:31.209,000 --> 0:10:34,000
A great friend Sue Anna from Korea.

251
0:10:35.458,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Tom, who was just adopted by an American family, from China,

252
0:10:39.414,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This is my great friend Harry from Puerto Rico.

253
0:10:42.685,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And Natalia.

254
0:10:43.928,000 --> 0:10:46,000
She and I started the first albinism society in Russia.

255
0:10:47.591,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Maizan and her sister and mom in Malaysia.

256
0:10:51.726,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Ceara. All she ever wanted to do was be a dancer.

257
0:10:54.725,000 --> 0:10:56,000
She was told that because of her visual impairment,

258
0:10:56.841,000 --> 0:10:57,000
she'll never dance.

259
0:10:58.217,000 --> 0:11:01,000
She'll never be able to follow the choreography or the dance steps.

260
0:11:01.283,000 --> 0:11:05,000
She's like, they said, find another love, another passion.

261
0:11:05.804,000 --> 0:11:06,000
She's like, no.

262
0:11:07.221,000 --> 0:11:09,000
She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion,

263
0:11:09.367,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and just started a school for dance for kids with visual impairment.

264
0:11:12.647,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm going to zip through this. Roz, from Australia.

265
0:11:15.85,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I spend a lot of time in Africa,

266
0:11:17.534,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where there's a high incidence of mortality associated with albinism,

267
0:11:20.31,000 --> 0:11:21,000
due to skin cancer.

268
0:11:21.956,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is my friend Siri, who when she was born,

269
0:11:24.603,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the father's family put her out of the house,

270
0:11:26.504,000 --> 0:11:28,000
thinking she was cursed.

271
0:11:28.865,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and Mom, not knowing what to do,

272
0:11:30.686,000 --> 0:11:33,000
put Siri in the sun to get her dark like her brothers and sisters.

273
0:11:33.771,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So you can see, it's all sun damage.

274
0:11:36.672,000 --> 0:11:4,000
A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa were put in special schools,

275
0:11:40.98,000 --> 0:11:42,000
schools for the blind,

276
0:11:43.168,000 --> 0:11:46,000
not because the tools were better there for kids with visual impairment,

277
0:11:46.237,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but more importantly, because the teasing was so great,

278
0:11:48.64,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the discrimination is so great,

279
0:11:49.879,000 --> 0:11:52,000
these kids don't do well in mainstream schools.

280
0:11:53.218,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I started an albinism society in Kenya with my friend C.K.,

281
0:11:56.688,000 --> 0:11:57,000
who actually went to a mainstream school.

282
0:11:58.188,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'm like, C.K., how is it possible you went to a mainstream school?

283
0:12:01.092,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Nobody in Africa goes to mainstream schools.

284
0:12:02.943,000 --> 0:12:04,000
She said, "It's because of my twin sister, Delphine."

285
0:12:05.383,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Fantastic. She said Delphine would get all the work off the board,

286
0:12:09.237,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the things I couldn't see, she'd help me with it.

287
0:12:11.627,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If the type was too small, she'd blow it up for me, she said.

288
0:12:14.276,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But more importantly, when kids would tease me,

289
0:12:16.408,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Delphine would beat them up.

290
0:12:18.136,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

291
0:12:19.734,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But on a sadder note, I was spending a lot of time in Tanzania,

292
0:12:22.093,000 --> 0:12:23,000
where witch doctors are saying,

293
0:12:23.28,000 --> 0:12:25,000
bring me the bones of an albino,

294
0:12:25.49,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I'll make a potion that will make you rich.

295
0:12:27.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So we're working very closely with the government there,

296
0:12:29.922,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I've been there six times in the last two years,

297
0:12:31.638,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to create public awareness programs to save these kids.

298
0:12:37.862,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This is the dancer.

299
0:12:39.711,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This is in the Shinyanga region.

300
0:12:41.9,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is one of the visuals that we created in East Africa,

301
0:12:45.739,000 --> 0:12:47,000
trying to fight and educate the public.

302
0:12:48.718,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I received the Art of Reporting award, from an organization

303
0:12:51.986,000 --> 0:12:53,000
called the Chromosome 18 Registry.

304
0:12:54.04,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The larger organization was the Genetic Alliance,

305
0:12:57.789,000 --> 0:12:58,000
which was a coalition of all the genetic support groups,

306
0:12:59.768,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and it was the award for the Life magazine piece.

307
0:13:02.788,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The president at the time said,

308
0:13:04.268,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I'm also the founder and director

309
0:13:05.637,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of the Chromosome 18 Research Society and Registry.

310
0:13:08.346,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I'm like, fantastic! That's great. What's that?

311
0:13:10.587,000 --> 0:13:13,000
She's like, well, if you have an anomaly on your 18th chromosome,

312
0:13:13.803,000 --> 0:13:16,000
then you have all kinds of problems and difficulties and challenges,

313
0:13:17.071,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and then we look after you, through this support group, like NOAH is.

314
0:13:20.387,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So I'm like, that's great.

315
0:13:22.462,000 --> 0:13:23,000
She said, I see there's a universal message here,

316
0:13:24.427,000 --> 0:13:26,000
about all kids with differences, so it's not just about albinism.

317
0:13:27.094,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Would you come and speak to our families in San Antonio

318
0:13:29.793,000 --> 0:13:3,000
with these chromosome 18 anomalies?

319
0:13:31.472,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm like, sure! I went back to them thinking,

320
0:13:34.102,000 --> 0:13:35,000
what the hell is a chromosome 18 anomaly?

321
0:13:35.502,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I was an art major at the school of visual arts,

322
0:13:36.952,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I had no idea.

323
0:13:38.641,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But I looked it up, these are the images that I saw.

324
0:13:42.07,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, this is going to be rough.

325
0:13:44.886,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But I went to San Antonio,

326
0:13:46.961,000 --> 0:13:48,000
walked down to the auditorium where the kids and young adults were,

327
0:13:49.596,000 --> 0:13:5,000
opened the door, and I was instantly surrounded

328
0:13:51.488,000 --> 0:13:52,000
by kids screaming with laughter.

329
0:13:52.92,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There were kids with cleft palates, kids with mobility issues,

330
0:13:56.404,000 --> 0:13:58,000
feeding tubes, trachs, but they were kids, first and foremost.

331
0:13:59.346,000 --> 0:14:,000
That's Rebecca and Pauline.

332
0:14:00.917,000 --> 0:14:03,000
My great friend, that's Ellington. He's awesome.

333
0:14:04.593,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Remy.

334
0:14:06.247,000 --> 0:14:08,000
That's Emory.

335
0:14:08.693,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Byron.

336
0:14:10.386,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Taylor.

337
0:14:12.248,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Elizabeth.

338
0:14:13.795,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And my great friend Sean.

339
0:14:15.872,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So we decided at that point to involve other organizations

340
0:14:19.733,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to be part of this larger exhibition

341
0:14:22.975,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that was going to be sent out from the People's Genome Celebration in 2001.

342
0:14:28.187,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The National Human Genome Research Institute and the Genetic Alliance

343
0:14:31.435,000 --> 0:14:34,000
invited me to create an exhibition at the Smithsonian,

344
0:14:34.476,000 --> 0:14:36,000
commemorating the mapping of the human genome.

345
0:14:36.666,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So we actually invited other genetic support groups

346
0:14:39.109,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to be part of this exhibition, not just on albinism, but all groups,

347
0:14:42.428,000 --> 0:14:44,000
again illustrating the universal applicability.

348
0:14:44.874,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I saw these images from the Marfan Foundation,

349
0:14:47.102,000 --> 0:14:5,000
these kids grow very, very tall, at risk of an aortic dissection,

350
0:14:50.574,000 --> 0:14:52,000
but they're amazing kids, and I thought, how gorgeous.

351
0:14:52.891,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And I understood the importance of this image,

352
0:14:55.811,000 --> 0:14:57,000
how important it was to show how beautiful,

353
0:14:57.92,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and to show how the image presents itself.

354
0:14:59.919,000 --> 0:15:,000
But isn't there another way to show it?

355
0:15:01.778,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Because nobody, and I've photographed thousands of kids now,

356
0:15:03.94,000 --> 0:15:04,000
with Marfan Syndrome,

357
0:15:05.022,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and nobody stands like this, with a portable black bar.

358
0:15:08.055,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's extraordinary. So we decided to put them in a pool,

359
0:15:10.734,000 --> 0:15:12,000
show Billy swimming -- ["Bill with Marfan Syndrome"] --

360
0:15:12.98,000 --> 0:15:13,000
show how it presents itself, but keep going,

361
0:15:14.897,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and keep presenting how these kids look,

362
0:15:17.574,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but put the humanity back in these gorgeous images.

363
0:15:20.481,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I only have a few seconds here, so I'm going to go through.

364
0:15:23.709,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Cool girls at the Costello Conference.

365
0:15:25.528,000 --> 0:15:27,000
These are great friends Danielle and Maggie,

366
0:15:27.628,000 --> 0:15:29,000
who actually met at the last Costello Conference.

367
0:15:29.958,000 --> 0:15:31,000
For both, the first time they ever met anybody with the same syndrome.

368
0:15:32.87,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They go to the same conferences every year and I go and photograph them.

369
0:15:36.701,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And this year, they were there again in Florida,

370
0:15:38.187,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but this time it's a little different.

371
0:15:40.103,000 --> 0:15:43,000
They're gangsters now. (Laughter) But they're pretty amazing kids.

372
0:15:43.299,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I just want to talk very briefly about this really great kid,

373
0:15:49.55,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to talk very briefly about a project that we're taking these images,

374
0:15:53.793,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and bringing them into high schools.

375
0:15:55.348,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I can photograph a great kid in my studio,

376
0:15:58.068,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and she's having a brilliant time, and she feels 10,000 feet tall.

377
0:16:01.267,000 --> 0:16:05,000
By the time she leaves my studio and gets to Park Avenue,

378
0:16:05.282,000 --> 0:16:07,000
five people point at her, point at her birthmark,

379
0:16:07.583,000 --> 0:16:09,000
or at her white hair, or her wheelchair.

380
0:16:10.094,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So we have to make it relevant for all of us, for all these kids,

381
0:16:13.213,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to make people understand what the idea of celebrating diversity actually means.

382
0:16:17.606,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So we started a project called the PEARLS Project,

383
0:16:19.512,000 --> 0:16:21,000
where these photographs are going into high schools,

384
0:16:21.986,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and the kids that are in the images are blogging,

385
0:16:24.333,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and the students are following their blogs.

386
0:16:26.46,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And they all have these great video intros.

387
0:16:28.329,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I just want to give you this last one, and this is actually Byron,

388
0:16:30.885,000 --> 0:16:32,000
who is actually one of our bloggers.

389
0:16:32.997,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron.

390
0:16:34.899,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14.

391
0:16:37.601,000 --> 0:16:38,000
When I was 10 months old,

392
0:16:39.339,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I had a left hemispherectomy.

393
0:16:42.375,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I had the left half of my brain removed,

394
0:16:46.277,000 --> 0:16:5,000
because I have something called Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

395
0:16:51.063,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I wear a brace on my right leg and right arm.

396
0:16:55.835,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I only see out of the right side of each eye,

397
0:16:59.394,000 --> 0:17:06,000
so sometimes it's harder for me to see things on the right side.

398
0:17:06.875,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So playing sports can be frustrating, because I might not see a ball coming.

399
0:17:19.122,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I didn't see that coming. Excuse me.

400
0:17:22.224,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Rick Guidotti: So we're using all the visual art

401
0:17:25.7,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to change public perceptions through these great kids.

402
0:17:28.454,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I feel as an artist, it's my responsibility.

403
0:17:30.751,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I know that when I was a kid,

404
0:17:31.992,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and I saw someone that was different walking down the street,

405
0:17:34.553,000 --> 0:17:36,000
If I stared, I got slapped by my mom.

406
0:17:36.846,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So the idea was if you don't stare, look away.

407
0:17:40.3,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And I think as an artist, it's my responsibility,

408
0:17:42.317,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and all of our responsibilities,

409
0:17:44.004,000 --> 0:17:46,000
to steady that gaze a little bit longer.

410
0:17:46.242,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Because you stand there, and you'll see a difference.

411
0:17:49.543,000 --> 0:17:51,000
You'll start seeing beauty in that difference.

412
0:17:51.979,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And you'll start seeing beautiful gorgeousness,

413
0:17:54.072,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and then this light just spreads, and once you're enlightened,

414
0:17:57.059,000 --> 0:17:58,000
it just changes your whole world.

415
0:17:58.736,000 --> 0:18:,000
It's about seeing the beauty in all differences.

416
0:18:01.186,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over.

417
0:18:02.667,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Thank you guys, thank you.

2
0:00:12.782,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm in the business of safeguarding secrets,

3
0:00:16.081,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and this includes your secrets.

4
0:00:19.206,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Cryptographers are the first line of defense

5
0:00:21.364,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in an ongoing war that's been raging for centuries:

6
0:00:24.97,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a war between code makers

7
0:00:27.257,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and code breakers.

8
0:00:29.03,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And this is a war on information.

9
0:00:32.227,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The modern battlefield for information is digital.

10
0:00:35.735,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it wages across your phones,

11
0:00:37.921,000 --> 0:00:38,000
your computers

12
0:00:39.121,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the internet.

13
0:00:41.299,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Our job is to create systems that scramble your emails and credit card numbers,

14
0:00:46.302,000 --> 0:00:48,000
your phone calls and text messages --

15
0:00:48.585,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that includes those saucy selfies --

16
0:00:50.801,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:52.047,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so that all of this information can only be descrambled

18
0:00:54.824,000 --> 0:00:56,000
by the recipient that it's intended for.

19
0:00:58.017,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, until very recently,

20
0:01:00.354,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we thought we'd won this war for good.

21
0:01:03.694,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Right now, each of your smartphones is using encryption

22
0:01:06.663,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we thought was unbreakable and that was going to remain that way.

23
0:01:11.654,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We were wrong,

24
0:01:13.618,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because quantum computers are coming,

25
0:01:16.028,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they're going to change the game completely.

26
0:01:20.445,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Throughout history, cryptography and code-breaking

27
0:01:22.925,000 --> 0:01:24,000
has always been this game of cat and mouse.

28
0:01:25.598,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Back in the 1500s,

29
0:01:27.299,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Queen Mary of the Scots thought she was sending encrypted letters

30
0:01:30.502,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that only her soldiers could decipher.

31
0:01:33.074,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But Queen Elizabeth of England,

32
0:01:35.144,000 --> 0:01:37,000
she had code breakers that were all over it.

33
0:01:38.116,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They decrypted Mary's letters,

34
0:01:40.145,000 --> 0:01:43,000
saw that she was attempting to assassinate Elizabeth

35
0:01:43.342,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and, subsequently, they chopped Mary's head off.

36
0:01:47.729,000 --> 0:01:49,000
A few centuries later, in World War II,

37
0:01:50.987,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the Nazis communicated using the Engima code,

38
0:01:53.895,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a much more complicated encryption scheme that they thought was unbreakable.

39
0:01:58.274,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But then good old Alan Turing,

40
0:02:00.228,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the same guy who invented what we now call the modern computer,

41
0:02:03.287,000 --> 0:02:05,000
he built a machine and used it to break Enigma.

42
0:02:06.545,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He deciphered the German messages

43
0:02:08.174,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and helped to bring Hitler and his Third Reich to a halt.

44
0:02:11.772,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And so the story has gone throughout the centuries.

45
0:02:14.821,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Cryptographers improve their encryption,

46
0:02:17.347,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and then code breakers fight back and they find a way to break it.

47
0:02:20.969,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This war's gone back and forth, and it's been pretty neck and neck.

48
0:02:25.533,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That was until the 1970s,

49
0:02:28.272,000 --> 0:02:3,000
when some cryptographers made a huge breakthrough.

50
0:02:31.781,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They discovered an extremely powerful way to do encryption

51
0:02:35.366,000 --> 0:02:36,000
called "public-key cryptography."

52
0:02:37.839,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Unlike all of the prior methods used throughout history, it doesn't require

53
0:02:42.138,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that the two parties that want to send each other confidential information

54
0:02:45.769,000 --> 0:02:47,000
have exchanged the secret key beforehand.

55
0:02:48.602,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The magic of public-key cryptography is that it allows us to connect securely

56
0:02:52.738,000 --> 0:02:53,000
with anyone in the world,

57
0:02:55.481,000 --> 0:02:57,000
whether we've exchanged data before or not,

58
0:02:58.374,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and to do it so fast that you and I don't even realize it's happening.

59
0:03:03.001,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Whether you're texting your mate to catch up for a beer,

60
0:03:06.263,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or you're a bank that's transferring billions of dollars to another bank,

61
0:03:10.534,000 --> 0:03:13,000
modern encryption enables us to send data that can be secured

62
0:03:13.609,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in a matter of milliseconds.

63
0:03:17.502,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The brilliant idea that makes this magic possible,

64
0:03:20.408,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it relies on hard mathematical problems.

65
0:03:23.623,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Cryptographers are deeply interested in things that calculators can't do.

66
0:03:29.25,000 --> 0:03:32,000
For example, calculators can multiply any two numbers you like,

67
0:03:32.675,000 --> 0:03:33,000
no matter how big the size.

68
0:03:35.175,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But going back the other way --

69
0:03:37.14,000 --> 0:03:39,000
starting with the product and then asking,

70
0:03:39.382,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Which two numbers multiply to give this one?" --

71
0:03:41.771,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that's actually a really hard problem.

72
0:03:45.358,000 --> 0:03:49,000
If I asked you to find which two-digit numbers multiply to give 851,

73
0:03:51.051,000 --> 0:03:52,000
even with a calculator,

74
0:03:52.267,000 --> 0:03:55,000
most people in this room would have a hard time finding the answer

75
0:03:55.398,000 --> 0:03:56,000
by the time I'm finished with this talk.

76
0:03:57.338,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And if I make the numbers a little larger,

77
0:04:00.023,000 --> 0:04:03,000
then there's no calculator on earth that can do this.

78
0:04:03.704,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In fact, even the world's fastest supercomputer

79
0:04:06.611,000 --> 0:04:08,000
would take longer than the life age of the universe

80
0:04:09.125,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to find the two numbers that multiply to give this one.

81
0:04:13.029,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And this problem, called "integer factorization,"

82
0:04:16.394,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is exactly what each of your smartphones and laptops is using right now

83
0:04:20.044,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to keep your data secure.

84
0:04:22.254,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is the basis of modern encryption.

85
0:04:26.266,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the fact that all the computing power on the planet combined can't solve it,

86
0:04:30.5,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's the reason we cryptographers thought we'd found a way

87
0:04:33.397,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to stay ahead of the code breakers for good.

88
0:04:37.131,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Perhaps we got a little cocky

89
0:04:39.902,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because just when we thought the war was won,

90
0:04:42.272,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a bunch of 20th-century physicists came to the party,

91
0:04:45.234,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they revealed that the laws of the universe,

92
0:04:47.937,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the same laws that modern cryptography was built upon,

93
0:04:51.422,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they aren't as we thought they were.

94
0:04:54.205,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We thought that one object couldn't be in two places at the same time.

95
0:04:58.262,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's not the case.

96
0:04:59.827,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We thought nothing can possibly spin clockwise and anticlockwise

97
0:05:03.563,000 --> 0:05:04,000
simultaneously.

98
0:05:05.265,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But that's incorrect.

99
0:05:07.173,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we thought that two objects on opposite sides of the universe,

100
0:05:10.907,000 --> 0:05:12,000
light years away from each other,

101
0:05:13.232,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they can't possibly influence one another instantaneously.

102
0:05:17.932,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We were wrong again.

103
0:05:20.403,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And isn't that always the way life seems to go?

104
0:05:22.636,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Just when you think you've got everything covered, your ducks in a row,

105
0:05:26.056,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a bunch of physicists come along

106
0:05:27.635,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and reveal that the fundamental laws of the universe are completely different

107
0:05:31.351,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to what you thought?

108
0:05:32.536,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:33.618,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And it screws everything up.

110
0:05:34.998,000 --> 0:05:38,000
See, in the teeny tiny subatomic realm,

111
0:05:39.548,000 --> 0:05:42,000
at the level of electrons and protons,

112
0:05:42.584,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the classical laws of physics,

113
0:05:44.43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the ones that we all know and love,

114
0:05:46.294,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they go out the window.

115
0:05:48.023,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And it's here that the laws of quantum mechanics kick in.

116
0:05:51.688,000 --> 0:05:52,000
In quantum mechanics,

117
0:05:52.898,000 --> 0:05:56,000
an electron can be spinning clockwise and anticlockwise at the same time,

118
0:05:57.4,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and a proton can be in two places at once.

119
0:06:01.94,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It sounds like science fiction,

120
0:06:04.087,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but that's only because the crazy quantum nature of our universe,

121
0:06:08.306,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it hides itself from us.

122
0:06:10.884,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And it stayed hidden from us until the 20th century.

123
0:06:15.494,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But now that we've seen it, the whole world is in an arms race

124
0:06:19.287,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to try to build a quantum computer --

125
0:06:22.455,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a computer that can harness the power of this weird and wacky quantum behavior.

126
0:06:28.375,000 --> 0:06:3,000
These things are so revolutionary

127
0:06:30.855,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and so powerful

128
0:06:32.645,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that they'll make today's fastest supercomputer

129
0:06:35.022,000 --> 0:06:37,000
look useless in comparison.

130
0:06:37.868,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In fact, for certain problems that are of great interest to us,

131
0:06:41.633,000 --> 0:06:43,000
today's fastest supercomputer is closer to an abacus

132
0:06:44.268,000 --> 0:06:45,000
than to a quantum computer.

133
0:06:45.967,000 --> 0:06:48,000
That's right, I'm talking about those little wooden things with the beads.

134
0:06:50.477,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Quantum computers can simulate chemical and biological processes

135
0:06:54.769,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that are far beyond the reach of our classical computers.

136
0:06:58.812,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And as such, they promise to help us solve some of our planet's biggest problems.

137
0:07:05.492,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They're going to help us combat global hunger;

138
0:07:09.074,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to tackle climate change;

139
0:07:11.415,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to find cures for diseases and pandemics for which we've so far been unsuccessful;

140
0:07:16.213,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to create superhuman artificial intelligence;

141
0:07:20.034,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and perhaps even more important than all of those things,

142
0:07:22.962,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they're going to help us understand the very nature of our universe.

143
0:07:28.376,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But with this incredible potential

144
0:07:31.788,000 --> 0:07:32,000
comes an incredible risk.

145
0:07:34.785,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Remember those big numbers I talked about earlier?

146
0:07:38.152,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I'm not talking about 851.

147
0:07:40.275,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In fact, if anyone in here has been distracted

148
0:07:42.48,000 --> 0:07:43,000
trying to find those factors,

149
0:07:43.943,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I'm going to put you out of your misery and tell you that it's 23 times 37.

150
0:07:47.521,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:48.739,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm talking about the much bigger number that followed it.

152
0:07:52.3,000 --> 0:07:55,000
While today's fastest supercomputer couldn't find those factors

153
0:07:55.824,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in the life age of the universe,

154
0:07:58.181,000 --> 0:08:,000
a quantum computer could easily factorize numbers

155
0:08:01.085,000 --> 0:08:02,000
way, way bigger than that one.

156
0:08:03.882,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Quantum computers will break all of the encryption currently used

157
0:08:07.316,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to protect you and I from hackers.

158
0:08:09.318,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And they'll do it easily.

159
0:08:12.539,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Let me put it this way:

160
0:08:13.896,000 --> 0:08:14,000
if quantum computing was a spear,

161
0:08:16.666,000 --> 0:08:17,000
then modern encryption,

162
0:08:18.225,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the same unbreakable system that's protected us for decades,

163
0:08:21.622,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it would be like a shield made of tissue paper.

164
0:08:25.578,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Anyone with access to a quantum computer will have the master key

165
0:08:29.59,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to unlock anything they like in our digital world.

166
0:08:33.293,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They could steal money from banks

167
0:08:35.129,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and control economies.

168
0:08:37.303,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They could power off hospitals or launch nukes.

169
0:08:40.224,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Or they could just sit back and watch all of us on our webcams

170
0:08:43.585,000 --> 0:08:45,000
without any of us knowing that this is happening.

171
0:08:49.314,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, the fundamental unit of information on all of the computers we're used to,

172
0:08:53.297,000 --> 0:08:54,000
like this one,

173
0:08:54.826,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it's called a "bit."

174
0:08:56.651,000 --> 0:08:58,000
A single bit can be one of two states:

175
0:08:58.898,000 --> 0:09:,000
it can be a zero or it can be a one.

176
0:09:02.157,000 --> 0:09:04,000
When I FaceTime my mum from the other side of the world --

177
0:09:05.746,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and she's going to kill me for having this slide --

178
0:09:08.256,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:09.675,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we're actually just sending each other long sequences of zeroes and ones

180
0:09:13.433,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that bounce from computer to computer, from satellite to satellite,

181
0:09:16.659,000 --> 0:09:18,000
transmitting our data at a rapid pace.

182
0:09:18.829,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Bits are certainly very useful.

183
0:09:20.856,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In fact, anything we currently do with technology

184
0:09:23.576,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is indebted to the usefulness of bits.

185
0:09:26.84,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But we're starting to realize

186
0:09:28.253,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that bits are really poor at simulating complex molecules and particles.

187
0:09:33.394,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And this is because, in some sense,

188
0:09:35.394,000 --> 0:09:38,000
subatomic processes can be doing two or more opposing things

189
0:09:38.503,000 --> 0:09:39,000
at the same time

190
0:09:39.715,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as they follow these bizarre rules of quantum mechanics.

191
0:09:43.232,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So, late last century,

192
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
some really brainy physicists had this ingenious idea:

193
0:09:48.041,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to instead build computers that are founded

194
0:09:50.066,000 --> 0:09:52,000
on the principles of quantum mechanics.

195
0:09:54.557,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, the fundamental unit of information of a quantum computer,

196
0:09:57.8,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it's called a "qubit."

197
0:09:59.582,000 --> 0:10:,000
It stands for "quantum bit."

198
0:10:02.986,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Instead of having just two states, like zero or one,

199
0:10:06.267,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a qubit can be an infinite number of states.

200
0:10:09.849,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And this corresponds to it being some combination of both zero and one

201
0:10:13.539,000 --> 0:10:14,000
at the same time,

202
0:10:15.35,000 --> 0:10:17,000
a phenomenon that we call "superposition."

203
0:10:18.569,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And when we have two qubits in superposition,

204
0:10:21.298,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we're actually working across all four combinations

205
0:10:23.704,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of zero-zero, zero-one, one-zero and one-one.

206
0:10:26.94,000 --> 0:10:27,000
With three qubits,

207
0:10:28.31,000 --> 0:10:31,000
we're working in superposition across eight combinations,

208
0:10:31.575,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and so on.

209
0:10:33.294,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Each time we add a single qubit, we double the number of combinations

210
0:10:37.268,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that we can work with in superposition

211
0:10:40.894,000 --> 0:10:41,000
at the same time.

212
0:10:43.005,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And so when we scale up to work with many qubits,

213
0:10:45.658,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we can work with an exponential number of combinations

214
0:10:49.304,000 --> 0:10:5,000
at the same time.

215
0:10:51.44,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And this just hints at where the power of quantum computing is coming from.

216
0:10:56.964,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, in modern encryption,

217
0:10:59.429,000 --> 0:11:02,000
our secret keys, like the two factors of that larger number,

218
0:11:03.381,000 --> 0:11:05,000
they're just long sequences of zeroes and ones.

219
0:11:06.539,000 --> 0:11:07,000
To find them,

220
0:11:07.807,000 --> 0:11:11,000
a classical computer must go through every single combination,

221
0:11:12.275,000 --> 0:11:13,000
one after the other,

222
0:11:13.45,000 --> 0:11:16,000
until it finds the one that works and breaks our encryption.

223
0:11:18.191,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But on a quantum computer,

224
0:11:20.779,000 --> 0:11:23,000
with enough qubits in superposition,

225
0:11:25.001,000 --> 0:11:29,000
information can be extracted from all combinations at the same time.

226
0:11:30.912,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In very few steps,

227
0:11:32.19,000 --> 0:11:35,000
a quantum computer can brush aside all of the incorrect combinations,

228
0:11:36.188,000 --> 0:11:37,000
home in on the correct one

229
0:11:37.625,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and then unlock our treasured secrets.

230
0:11:44.215,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now, at the crazy quantum level,

231
0:11:47.9,000 --> 0:11:49,000
something truly incredible is happening here.

232
0:11:52.625,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The conventional wisdom held by many leading physicists --

233
0:11:56.323,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and you've got to stay with me on this one --

234
0:11:58.966,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is that each combination is actually examined by its very own quantum computer

235
0:12:03.413,000 --> 0:12:05,000
inside its very own parallel universe.

236
0:12:07.303,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Each of these combinations, they add up like waves in a pool of water.

237
0:12:12.085,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The combinations that are wrong,

238
0:12:14.095,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they cancel each other out.

239
0:12:16.097,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And the combinations that are right,

240
0:12:17.881,000 --> 0:12:18,000
they reinforce and amplify each other.

241
0:12:20.241,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So at the end of the quantum computing program,

242
0:12:22.93,000 --> 0:12:24,000
all that's left is the correct answer,

243
0:12:25.771,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that we can then observe here in this universe.

244
0:12:29.575,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Now, if that doesn't make complete sense to you, don't stress.

245
0:12:32.735,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:33.807,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You're in good company.

247
0:12:36.205,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Niels Bohr, one of the pioneers of this field,

248
0:12:39.395,000 --> 0:12:42,000
he once said that anyone who could contemplate quantum mechanics

249
0:12:42.426,000 --> 0:12:44,000
without being profoundly shocked,

250
0:12:44.813,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they haven't understood it.

251
0:12:46.293,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Laughter)

252
0:12:47.744,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But you get an idea of what we're up against,

253
0:12:49.923,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and why it's now up to us cryptographers

254
0:12:52.009,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to really step it up.

255
0:12:54.674,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And we have to do it fast,

256
0:12:56.787,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because quantum computers,

257
0:12:58.843,000 --> 0:13:01,000
they already exist in labs all over the world.

258
0:13:03.248,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Fortunately, at this minute,

259
0:13:05.169,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they only exist at a relatively small scale,

260
0:13:07.863,000 --> 0:13:1,000
still too small to break our much larger cryptographic keys.

261
0:13:12.127,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But we might not be safe for long.

262
0:13:14.968,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Some folks believe that secret government agencies

263
0:13:17.488,000 --> 0:13:18,000
have already built a big enough one,

264
0:13:19.425,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and they just haven't told anyone yet.

265
0:13:21.961,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Some pundits say they're more like 10 years off.

266
0:13:24.414,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Some people say it's more like 30.

267
0:13:27.163,000 --> 0:13:29,000
You might think that if quantum computers are 10 years away,

268
0:13:30.044,000 --> 0:13:33,000
surely that's enough time for us cryptographers to figure it out

269
0:13:33.132,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and to secure the internet in time.

270
0:13:34.85,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But unfortunately, it's not that easy.

271
0:13:37.521,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Even if we ignore the many years that it takes

272
0:13:39.733,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to standardize and deploy and then roll out new encryption technology,

273
0:13:43.423,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in some ways we may already be too late.

274
0:13:47.407,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Smart digital criminals and government agencies

275
0:13:50.603,000 --> 0:13:54,000
may already be storing our most sensitive encrypted data

276
0:13:54.906,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in anticipation for the quantum future ahead.

277
0:13:59.069,000 --> 0:14:,000
The messages of foreign leaders,

278
0:14:02.1,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of war generals

279
0:14:04.653,000 --> 0:14:06,000
or of individuals who question power,

280
0:14:07.936,000 --> 0:14:08,000
they're encrypted for now.

281
0:14:10.487,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But as soon as the day comes

282
0:14:12.112,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that someone gets their hands on a quantum computer,

283
0:14:14.912,000 --> 0:14:17,000
they can retroactively break anything from the past.

284
0:14:19.078,000 --> 0:14:21,000
In certain government and financial sectors

285
0:14:21.132,000 --> 0:14:22,000
or in military organizations,

286
0:14:22.559,000 --> 0:14:25,000
sensitive data has got to remain classified for 25 years.

287
0:14:26.273,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So if a quantum computer really will exist in 10 years,

288
0:14:29.477,000 --> 0:14:31,000
then these guys are already 15 years too late

289
0:14:31.791,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to quantum-proof their encryption.

290
0:14:34.858,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So while many scientists around the world

291
0:14:36.858,000 --> 0:14:38,000
are racing to try to build a quantum computer,

292
0:14:39.785,000 --> 0:14:42,000
us cryptographers are urgently looking to reinvent encryption

293
0:14:43.259,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to protect us long before that day comes.

294
0:14:46.718,000 --> 0:14:48,000
We're looking for new, hard mathematical problems.

295
0:14:50.435,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We're looking for problems that, just like factorization,

296
0:14:53.47,000 --> 0:14:56,000
can be used on our smartphones and on our laptops today.

297
0:14:57.596,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But unlike factorization, we need these problems to be so hard

298
0:15:01.995,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that they're even unbreakable with a quantum computer.

299
0:15:06.366,000 --> 0:15:09,000
In recent years, we've been digging around a much wider realm of mathematics

300
0:15:09.996,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to look for such problems.

301
0:15:12.205,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We've been looking at numbers and objects

302
0:15:14.2,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that are far more exotic and far more abstract

303
0:15:16.392,000 --> 0:15:17,000
than the ones that you and I are used to,

304
0:15:18.372,000 --> 0:15:19,000
like the ones on our calculators.

305
0:15:19.993,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we believe we've found some geometric problems

306
0:15:22.397,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that just might do the trick.

307
0:15:24.383,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Now, unlike those two- and three-dimensional geometric problems

308
0:15:27.47,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that we used to have to try to solve with pen and graph paper in high school,

309
0:15:31.193,000 --> 0:15:35,000
most of these problems are defined in well over 500 dimensions.

310
0:15:36.453,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So not only are they a little hard to depict and solve on graph paper,

311
0:15:40.233,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but we believe they're even out of the reach of a quantum computer.

312
0:15:45.392,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So though it's early days,

313
0:15:47.113,000 --> 0:15:51,000
it's here that we are putting our hope as we try to secure our digital world

314
0:15:51.642,000 --> 0:15:52,000
moving into its quantum future.

315
0:15:55.171,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Just like all of the other scientists,

316
0:15:57.048,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we cryptographers are tremendously excited

317
0:15:59.235,000 --> 0:16:02,000
at the potential of living in a world alongside quantum computers.

318
0:16:04.839,000 --> 0:16:06,000
They could be such a force for good.

319
0:16:09.508,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But no matter what technological future we live in,

320
0:16:16.867,000 --> 0:16:2,000
our secrets will always be a part of our humanity.

321
0:16:22.637,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And that is worth protecting.

322
0:16:25.559,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Thanks.

323
0:16:26.737,000 --> 0:16:29,000

1
0:00:12.79,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Twenty-three years ago,

2
0:00:15.395,000 --> 0:00:17,000
at the age of 19,

3
0:00:18.15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I shot and killed a man.

4
0:00:21.451,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was a young drug dealer

5
0:00:23.594,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with a quick temper

6
0:00:25.963,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and a semi-automatic pistol.

7
0:00:30.018,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But that wasn't the end of my story.

8
0:00:32.789,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In fact, it was beginning,

9
0:00:36.93,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the 23 years since

10
0:00:39.105,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is a story of acknowledgment,

11
0:00:42.827,000 --> 0:00:45,000
apology and atonement.

12
0:00:46.31,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But it didn't happen in the way

13
0:00:47.733,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that you might imagine or think.

14
0:00:51.027,000 --> 0:00:52,000
These things occurred in my life

15
0:00:52.485,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in a way that was surprising,

16
0:00:54.628,000 --> 0:00:55,000
especially to me.

17
0:00:56.263,000 --> 0:00:59,000
See, like many of you,

18
0:00:59.404,000 --> 0:01:01,000
growing up, I was an honor roll student,

19
0:01:01.978,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a scholarship student,

20
0:01:03.321,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with dreams of becoming a doctor.

21
0:01:05.925,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But things went dramatically wrong

22
0:01:08.556,000 --> 0:01:1,000
when my parents separated

23
0:01:10.73,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and eventually divorced.

24
0:01:14.567,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The actual events are pretty straightforward.

25
0:01:17.417,000 --> 0:01:19,000
At the age of 17,

26
0:01:19.865,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I got shot three times

27
0:01:21.51,000 --> 0:01:25,000
standing on the corner of my block in Detroit.

28
0:01:26.135,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My friend rushed me to the hospital.

29
0:01:28.83,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Doctors pulled the bullets out,

30
0:01:32.054,000 --> 0:01:33,000
patched me up,

31
0:01:33.845,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and sent me back to the same neighborhood where I got shot.

32
0:01:38.216,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Throughout this ordeal,

33
0:01:40.971,000 --> 0:01:42,000
no one hugged me,

34
0:01:43.031,000 --> 0:01:45,000
no one counseled me,

35
0:01:45.401,000 --> 0:01:47,000
no one told me I would be okay.

36
0:01:48.341,000 --> 0:01:5,000
No one told me that I would live in fear,

37
0:01:51.265,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that I would become paranoid,

38
0:01:53.878,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or that I would react hyper-violently

39
0:01:56.871,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to being shot.

40
0:01:59.249,000 --> 0:02:01,000
No one told me that one day,

41
0:02:02.07,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I would become the person behind the trigger.

42
0:02:06.127,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Fourteen months later,

43
0:02:08.801,000 --> 0:02:1,000
at 2 a.m.,

44
0:02:11.411,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I fired the shots

45
0:02:13.047,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that caused a man's death.

46
0:02:16.9,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When I entered prison,

47
0:02:18.81,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.

48
0:02:24.317,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I didn't want to take responsibility.

49
0:02:27.287,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I blamed everybody from my parents

50
0:02:29.339,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to the system.

51
0:02:32.312,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I rationalized my decision to shoot

52
0:02:34.524,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because in the hood where I come from,

53
0:02:36.963,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's better to be the shooter

54
0:02:38.589,000 --> 0:02:41,000
than the person getting shot.

55
0:02:41.901,000 --> 0:02:44,000
As I sat in my cold cell,

56
0:02:45.223,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I felt helpless,

57
0:02:46.87,000 --> 0:02:49,000
unloved and abandoned.

58
0:02:50.257,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I felt like nobody cared,

59
0:02:54.135,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I reacted

60
0:02:56.154,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with hostility to my confinement.

61
0:02:59.165,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I found myself getting

62
0:03:00.303,000 --> 0:03:02,000
deeper and deeper into trouble.

63
0:03:02.618,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I ran black market stores,

64
0:03:05.398,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I loan sharked,

65
0:03:08.117,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled

66
0:03:10.183,000 --> 0:03:11,000
into the prison.

67
0:03:12.044,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I had in fact become

68
0:03:13.614,000 --> 0:03:15,000
what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called

69
0:03:16.295,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"the worst of the worst."

70
0:03:19.132,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And because of my activity,

71
0:03:21.457,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I landed in solitary confinement

72
0:03:24.149,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for seven and a half years

73
0:03:26.578,000 --> 0:03:29,000
out of my incarceration.

74
0:03:29.79,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now as I see it, solitary confinement

75
0:03:31.459,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places

76
0:03:33.399,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you can find yourself,

77
0:03:36.298,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but find myself I did.

78
0:03:39.189,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One day, I was pacing my cell,

79
0:03:42.7,000 --> 0:03:46,000
when an officer came and delivered mail.

80
0:03:47.217,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I looked at a couple of letters

81
0:03:48.954,000 --> 0:03:49,000
before I looked at the letter

82
0:03:50.868,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.

83
0:03:53.93,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And anytime I would get a letter from my son,

84
0:03:55.367,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it was like a ray of light

85
0:03:57.272,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in the darkest place you can imagine.

86
0:04:00.029,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And on this particular day, I opened this letter,

87
0:04:03.844,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and in capital letters, he wrote,

88
0:04:06.95,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"My mama told me why you was in prison:

89
0:04:10.205,000 --> 0:04:12,000
murder."

90
0:04:12.899,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He said, "Dad, don't kill.

91
0:04:14.818,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him."

92
0:04:20.265,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now, I wasn't religious at that time,

93
0:04:22.1,000 --> 0:04:23,000
nor am I religious now,

94
0:04:23.807,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but it was something so profound

95
0:04:26.291,000 --> 0:04:28,000
about my son's words.

96
0:04:29.063,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They made me examine things about my life

97
0:04:30.685,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that I hadn't considered.

98
0:04:32.621,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It was the first time in my life

99
0:04:34.557,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that I had actually thought about the fact

100
0:04:36.529,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that my son would see me as a murderer.

101
0:04:40.195,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I sat back on my bunk

102
0:04:42.249,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I reflected on something I had read

103
0:04:44.268,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in [Plato],

104
0:04:46.865,000 --> 0:04:47,000
where Socrates stated in "Apology"

105
0:04:48.84,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that the unexamined life isn't worth living.

106
0:04:53.111,000 --> 0:04:58,000
At that point is when the transformation began.

107
0:04:58.943,000 --> 0:05:,000
But it didn't come easy.

108
0:05:03.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
One of the things I realized,

109
0:05:05.764,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which was part of the transformation,

110
0:05:07.921,000 --> 0:05:1,000
was that there were four key things.

111
0:05:11.663,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The first thing was,

112
0:05:13.97,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I had great mentors.

113
0:05:16.283,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, I know some of you all are probably thinking,

114
0:05:18.159,000 --> 0:05:21,000
how did you find a great mentor in prison?

115
0:05:21.328,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But in my case,

116
0:05:24.193,000 --> 0:05:25,000
some of my mentors

117
0:05:25.423,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who are serving life sentences

118
0:05:27.3,000 --> 0:05:29,000
were some of the best people to ever come into my life,

119
0:05:30.009,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because they forced me to look at my life honestly,

120
0:05:33.273,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and they forced me to challenge myself

121
0:05:35.098,000 --> 0:05:37,000
about my decision making.

122
0:05:37.613,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The second thing was literature.

123
0:05:41.867,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Prior to going to prison,

124
0:05:43.61,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I didn't know that there were so many brilliant

125
0:05:45.607,000 --> 0:05:48,000
black poets, authors and philosophers,

126
0:05:48.888,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and then I had the great fortune

127
0:05:51.907,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,

128
0:05:56.074,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself.

129
0:06:00.621,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The third thing was family.

130
0:06:03.062,000 --> 0:06:07,000
For 19 years, my father stood by my side

131
0:06:07.738,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with an unshakable faith,

132
0:06:10.167,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because he believed that I had what it took

133
0:06:11.831,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to turn my life around.

134
0:06:14.125,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I also met an amazing woman

135
0:06:17.018,000 --> 0:06:2,000
who is now the mother of my two-year-old son Sekou,

136
0:06:20.452,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and she taught me how to love myself

137
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in a healthy way.

138
0:06:26.958,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The final thing was writing.

139
0:06:29.654,000 --> 0:06:3,000
When I got that letter from my son,

140
0:06:31.068,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I began to write a journal

141
0:06:33.278,000 --> 0:06:35,000
about things I had experienced in my childhood

142
0:06:36.079,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and in prison,

143
0:06:38.872,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea

144
0:06:42.138,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of atonement.

145
0:06:45.106,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Earlier in my incarceration, I had received

146
0:06:47.188,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a letter from one of the relatives of my victim,

147
0:06:50.995,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and in that letter,

148
0:06:53.84,000 --> 0:06:54,000
she told me she forgave me,

149
0:06:55.685,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because she realized I was a young child

150
0:06:57.634,000 --> 0:06:58,000
who had been abused

151
0:06:58.971,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and had been through some hardships

152
0:07:00.763,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and just made a series of poor decisions.

153
0:07:03.501,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It was the first time in my life

154
0:07:05.972,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that I ever felt open to forgiving myself.

155
0:07:13.701,000 --> 0:07:14,000
One of the things that happened

156
0:07:14.945,000 --> 0:07:16,000
after that experience is that

157
0:07:17.268,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I thought about the other men who were incarcerated

158
0:07:19.156,000 --> 0:07:2,000
alongside of me,

159
0:07:20.968,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and how much I wanted to share this with them.

160
0:07:23.89,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And so I started talking to them about

161
0:07:25.644,000 --> 0:07:26,000
some of their experiences,

162
0:07:27.571,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I was devastated to realize

163
0:07:29.053,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that most of them came from the same abusive environments,

164
0:07:32.431,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around,

165
0:07:35.97,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but unfortunately the system

166
0:07:37.71,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that currently holds 2.5 million people in prison

167
0:07:40.928,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is designed to warehouse

168
0:07:43.128,000 --> 0:07:47,000
as opposed to rehabilitate or transform.

169
0:07:47.42,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So I made it up in my mind

170
0:07:49.311,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that if I was ever released from prison

171
0:07:51.065,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that I would do everything in my power

172
0:07:53.522,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to help change that.

173
0:07:57.223,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In 2010, I walked out of prison

174
0:07:59.989,000 --> 0:08:02,000
for the first time after two decades.

175
0:08:03.067,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now imagine, if you will,

176
0:08:04.655,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Fred Flintstone walking into an episode

177
0:08:07.237,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of "The Jetsons."

178
0:08:09.62,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That was pretty much what my life was like.

179
0:08:12.555,000 --> 0:08:15,000
For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,

180
0:08:15.87,000 --> 0:08:16,000
social media,

181
0:08:17.606,000 --> 0:08:21,000
cars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider."

182
0:08:21.743,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But the thing that fascinated me the most

183
0:08:23.527,000 --> 0:08:24,000
was phone technology.

184
0:08:25.31,000 --> 0:08:26,000
See, when I went to prison,

185
0:08:26.582,000 --> 0:08:27,000
our car phones were this big

186
0:08:28.357,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and required two people to carry them.

187
0:08:30.958,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed

188
0:08:33.046,000 --> 0:08:35,000
my little Blackberry

189
0:08:35.172,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and I started learning how to text.

190
0:08:37.123,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But the thing is, the people around me,

191
0:08:38.79,000 --> 0:08:39,000
they didn't realize that I had no idea

192
0:08:40.386,000 --> 0:08:42,000
what all these abbreviated texts meant,

193
0:08:43.08,000 --> 0:08:48,000
like LOL, OMG, LMAO,

194
0:08:48.11,000 --> 0:08:49,000
until one day I was having a conversation

195
0:08:49.852,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with one of my friends via text,

196
0:08:52.108,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and I asked him to do something, and he responded back, "K."

197
0:08:56.139,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I was like, "What is K?"

198
0:08:59.318,000 --> 0:09:,000
And he was like, "K is okay."

199
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So in my head, I was like,

200
0:09:02.279,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Well what the hell is wrong with K?"

201
0:09:05.297,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And so I text him a question mark.

202
0:09:07.81,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And he said, "K = okay."

203
0:09:11.481,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And so I tap back, "FU." (Laughter)

204
0:09:16.17,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And then he texts back, and he asks me

205
0:09:17.926,000 --> 0:09:18,000
why was I cussing him out.

206
0:09:19.6,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And I said, "LOL FU,"

207
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as in, I finally understand.

208
0:09:23.959,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:25.996,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so fast forward three years,

210
0:09:29.261,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I'm doing relatively good.

211
0:09:31.135,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,

212
0:09:33.813,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I work for an amazing company called BMe,

213
0:09:37.03,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I teach at the University of Michigan,

214
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but it's been a struggle

215
0:09:41.337,000 --> 0:09:42,000
because I realize that there are more

216
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:43,000
men and women coming home

217
0:09:44.435,000 --> 0:09:47,000
who are not going to be afforded those opportunities.

218
0:09:47.596,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I've been blessed to work with some amazing

219
0:09:49.401,000 --> 0:09:51,000
men and women,

220
0:09:52.085,000 --> 0:09:53,000
helping others reenter society,

221
0:09:53.847,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.

222
0:09:58.06,000 --> 0:10:,000
He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.

223
0:10:01.015,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.

224
0:10:04.783,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And one of the things that we talked about

225
0:10:06.507,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is the three things that I found important

226
0:10:08.219,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in my personal transformation,

227
0:10:09.839,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the first being acknowledgment.

228
0:10:11.778,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.

229
0:10:14.204,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.

230
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The second thing was apologizing.

231
0:10:19.421,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt.

232
0:10:21.571,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Even though I had no expectations of them accepting it,

233
0:10:23.643,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it was important to do because it was the right thing.

234
0:10:26.395,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I also had to apologize to myself.

235
0:10:29.354,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The third thing was atoning.

236
0:10:32.171,000 --> 0:10:33,000
For me, atoning meant

237
0:10:33.854,000 --> 0:10:34,000
going back into my community

238
0:10:35.447,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and working with at-risk youth

239
0:10:36.99,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who were on the same path,

240
0:10:38.79,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but also becoming at one with myself.

241
0:10:42.53,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Through my experience of being locked up,

242
0:10:44.294,000 --> 0:10:46,000
one of the things I discovered is this:

243
0:10:46.475,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the majority of men and women

244
0:10:47.691,000 --> 0:10:5,000
who are incarcerated are redeemable,

245
0:10:51.112,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and the fact is,

246
0:10:52.372,000 --> 0:10:54,000
90 percent of the men and women who are incarcerated

247
0:10:54.723,000 --> 0:10:56,000
will at some point return to the community,

248
0:10:57.411,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and we have a role in determining what kind

249
0:10:59.326,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of men and women return to our community.

250
0:11:02.945,000 --> 0:11:04,000
My wish today

251
0:11:05.556,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is that we will embrace

252
0:11:09.209,000 --> 0:11:11,000
a more empathetic approach

253
0:11:11.358,000 --> 0:11:14,000
toward how we deal with mass incarceration,

254
0:11:14.578,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that we will do away with

255
0:11:15.722,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,

256
0:11:18.037,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because it's proven it doesn't work.

257
0:11:21.96,000 --> 0:11:23,000
My journey is a unique journey,

258
0:11:24.413,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but it doesn't have to be that way.

259
0:11:27.078,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Anybody can have a transformation

260
0:11:29.484,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if we create the space for that to happen.

261
0:11:32.324,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So what I'm asking today

262
0:11:34.086,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is that you envision

263
0:11:35.793,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a world where men and women

264
0:11:38.133,000 --> 0:11:41,000
aren't held hostage to their pasts,

265
0:11:41.829,000 --> 0:11:42,000
where misdeeds and mistakes

266
0:11:43.262,000 --> 0:11:45,000
don't define you for the rest of your life.

267
0:11:46.03,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I think collectively, we can create that reality,

268
0:11:49.221,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and I hope you do too.

269
0:11:50.924,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Thank you.

270
0:11:52.69,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

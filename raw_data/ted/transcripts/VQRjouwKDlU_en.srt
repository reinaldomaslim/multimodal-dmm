1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The language I'm speaking right now

2
0:00:15.44,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is on its way to becoming the world's universal language,

3
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for better or for worse.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Let's face it,

5
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it's the language of the internet,

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
it's the language of finance,

7
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
it's the language of air traffic control,

8
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of popular music,

9
0:00:31.04,000 --> 0:00:32,000
diplomacy --

10
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
English is everywhere.

11
0:00:34.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people,

12
0:00:38.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but more Chinese people are learning English

13
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
than English speakers are learning Chinese.

14
0:00:43.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Last I heard,

15
0:00:45.44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
there are two dozen universities in China right now

16
0:00:48.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
teaching all in English.

17
0:00:51.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
English is taking over.

18
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And in addition to that,

19
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it's been predicted that at the end of the century

20
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:01:,000
almost all of the languages that exist now --

21
0:01:01.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
there are about 6,000 --

22
0:01:02.32,000 --> 0:01:03,000
will no longer be spoken.

23
0:01:04.24,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There will only be some hundreds left.

24
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And on top of that,

25
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it's at the point where instant translation of live speech

26
0:01:13.6,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is not only possible, but it gets better every year.

27
0:01:17.36,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The reason I'm reciting those things to you

28
0:01:20.12,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is because I can tell that we're getting to the point

29
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
where a question is going to start being asked,

30
0:01:25.52,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which is: Why should we learn foreign languages --

31
0:01:29.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
other than if English happens to be foreign to one?

32
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Why bother to learn another one when it's getting to the point

33
0:01:36.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one?

34
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I think there are a lot of reasons,

35
0:01:44.4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but I first want to address

36
0:01:46.76,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the one that you're probably most likely to have heard of,

37
0:01:49.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because actually it's more dangerous than you might think.

38
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And that is the idea

39
0:01:55.76,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that a language channels your thoughts,

40
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages

41
0:02:02.96,000 --> 0:02:05,000
gives everybody a different kind of acid trip,

42
0:02:06.8,000 --> 0:02:07,000
so to speak.

43
0:02:08.04,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That is a marvelously enticing idea,

44
0:02:12.28,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but it's kind of fraught.

45
0:02:13.6,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So it's not that it's untrue completely.

46
0:02:17.08,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So for example, in French and Spanish

47
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine.

48
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, "la table," "la mesa," you just have to deal with it.

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It has been shown

50
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that if you are a speaker of one of those languages

51
0:02:33.1,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and you happen to be asked

52
0:02:35.8,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how you would imagine a table talking,

53
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:42,000
then much more often than could possibly be an accident,

54
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a French or a Spanish speaker

55
0:02:45.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
says that the table would talk with a high and feminine voice.

56
0:02:50.4,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl,

57
0:02:54.56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as opposed to if you are an English speaker.

58
0:02:57.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's hard not to love data like that,

59
0:02:59.6,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and many people will tell you that that means

60
0:03:01.76,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages.

61
0:03:06.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But you have to watch out,

62
0:03:07.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope,

63
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the us being those of us who speak English natively.

64
0:03:14.88,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What is the worldview from English?

65
0:03:18.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So for example, let's take an English speaker.

66
0:03:21.52,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Up on the screen, that is Bono.

67
0:03:24.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He speaks English.

68
0:03:26.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I presume he has a worldview.

69
0:03:29.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, that is Donald Trump.

70
0:03:33.12,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In his way,

71
0:03:34.36,000 --> 0:03:35,000
he speaks English as well.

72
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:39.52,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And here is Ms. Kardashian,

74
0:03:42.88,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and she is an English speaker, too.

75
0:03:44.88,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So here are three speakers of the English language.

76
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What worldview do those three people have in common?

77
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them?

78
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's a highly fraught concept.

79
0:03:58.24,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought,

80
0:04:03.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but it tends to be in rather darling, obscure psychological flutters.

81
0:04:09.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world.

82
0:04:14.68,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, if that's the case,

83
0:04:17.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
then why learn languages?

84
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
If it isn't going to change the way you think,

85
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:22,000
what would the other reasons be?

86
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:24,000
There are some.

87
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:3,000
One of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture,

88
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
if you want to drink it in, if you want to become part of it,

89
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
then whether or not the language channels the culture --

90
0:04:38.08,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and that seems doubtful --

91
0:04:40.04,000 --> 0:04:41,000
if you want to imbibe the culture,

92
0:04:41.88,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you have to control to some degree

93
0:04:44.36,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the language that the culture happens to be conducted in.

94
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There's no other way.

95
0:04:49.44,000 --> 0:04:51,000
There's an interesting illustration of this.

96
0:04:51.96,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out.

97
0:04:55.68,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand --

98
0:05:00.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
read out in English on the page, "Dennis Ar-cand,"

99
0:05:02.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if you want to look him up.

100
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."

101
0:05:07.2,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And many of the characters

102
0:05:09.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian,

103
0:05:14.44,000 --> 0:05:15,000
French-speaking women.

104
0:05:15.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There's one scene closest to the end,

105
0:05:18.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where they have to take a friend to an Anglophone hospital.

106
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In the hospital, they have to speak English.

107
0:05:23.88,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, they speak English but it's not their native language,

108
0:05:26.76,000 --> 0:05:27,000
they'd rather not speak English.

109
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And they speak it more slowly,

110
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they have accents, they're not idiomatic.

111
0:05:32.44,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Suddenly these characters that you've fallen in love with

112
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
become husks of themselves, they're shadows of themselves.

113
0:05:39.28,000 --> 0:05:4,000
To go into a culture

114
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain

115
0:05:45.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is to never truly get the culture.

116
0:05:47.96,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be left,

117
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
one reason to learn them

118
0:05:52.04,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is because they are tickets to being able to participate

119
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in the culture of the people who speak them,

120
0:05:58.04,000 --> 0:06:01,000
just by virtue of the fact that it is their code.

121
0:06:01.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So that's one reason.

122
0:06:03.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Second reason:

123
0:06:04.76,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it's been shown

124
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in,

125
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and that you are probably a better multitasker.

126
0:06:14.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And these are factors that set in early,

127
0:06:17.96,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and so that ought to give you some sense

128
0:06:19.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language.

129
0:06:24.48,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Bilingualism is healthy.

130
0:06:26.92,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And then, third --

131
0:06:28.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
languages are just an awful lot of fun.

132
0:06:32.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Much more fun than we're often told.

133
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So for example, Arabic: "kataba," he wrote,

134
0:06:37.88,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.

135
0:06:41.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"Uktub," write, in the imperative.

136
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What do those things have in common?

137
0:06:46.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
All those things have in common

138
0:06:48.2,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars.

139
0:06:51.76,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They stay still,

140
0:06:53.24,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the vowels dance around the consonants.

141
0:06:56.4,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths?

142
0:06:59.6,000 --> 0:07:,000
You can get that from Hebrew,

143
0:07:01.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you can get that from Ethiopia's main language, Amharic.

144
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
That's fun.

145
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Or languages have different word orders.

146
0:07:09.6,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Learning how to speak with different word order

147
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country,

148
0:07:16.84,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or the feeling that you get when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes

149
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and you feel the tingle.

150
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:24,000
A language can do that to you.

151
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So for example,

152
0:07:26.56,000 --> 0:07:28,000
"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"

153
0:07:28.6,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a book that I'm sure we all often return to,

154
0:07:31.12,000 --> 0:07:32,000
like "Moby Dick."

155
0:07:32.4,000 --> 0:07:37,000
One phrase in it is, "Do you know where I found him?

156
0:07:37.52,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Do you know where he was? He was eating cake in the tub,

157
0:07:40.2,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Yes he was!"

158
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Fine. Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese,

159
0:07:43.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
then you have to master,

160
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"You can know, I did where him find?

161
0:07:47.36,000 --> 0:07:48,000
He was tub inside gorging cake,

162
0:07:49.2,000 --> 0:07:5,000
No mistake gorging chewing!"

163
0:07:51.04,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That just feels good.

164
0:07:52.28,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time.

165
0:07:56.6,000 --> 0:08:,000
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?

166
0:08:00.96,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Me either, but if I did,

167
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker's dozen of vowels

168
0:08:08.64,000 --> 0:08:09,000
like English has,

169
0:08:09.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but a good 30 different vowels

170
0:08:12.96,000 --> 0:08:15,000
scooching and oozing around in the Cambodian mouth

171
0:08:16.88,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like bees in a hive.

172
0:08:19.24,000 --> 0:08:21,000
That is what a language can get you.

173
0:08:22.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And more to the point,

174
0:08:23.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language.

175
0:08:27.68,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It used to be that you had to go to a classroom,

176
0:08:29.96,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and there would be some diligent teacher --

177
0:08:32.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
some genius teacher in there --

178
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but that person was only in there at certain times

179
0:08:36.04,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and you had to go then,

180
0:08:37.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and then was not most times.

181
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You had to go to class.

182
0:08:40.974,000 --> 0:08:42,000
If you didn't have that, you had something called a record.

183
0:08:43.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I cut my teeth on those.

184
0:08:45.48,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There was only so much data on a record,

185
0:08:48.2,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or a cassette,

186
0:08:49.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or even that antique object known as a CD.

187
0:08:51.84,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Other than that you had books that didn't work,

188
0:08:54.48,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that's just the way it was.

189
0:08:55.88,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Today you can lay down --

190
0:08:58.8,000 --> 0:09:,000
lie on your living room floor,

191
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:02,000
sipping bourbon,

192
0:09:02.52,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and teach yourself any language that you want to

193
0:09:05.32,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone.

194
0:09:07.92,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well.

195
0:09:11.08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You can do it any time,

196
0:09:12.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
therefore you can do it more and better.

197
0:09:15.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages.

198
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I take some "Dilbert" in various languages every single morning;

199
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it can increase your skills.

200
0:09:24.76,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago

201
0:09:26.64,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when the idea of having any language you wanted

202
0:09:30.2,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in your pocket,

203
0:09:31.8,000 --> 0:09:32,000
coming from your phone,

204
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people.

205
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I highly recommend

206
0:09:40.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking,

207
0:09:44.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because there's never been a better time to do it.

208
0:09:47.56,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's an awful lot of fun.

209
0:09:49.08,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It won't change your mind,

210
0:09:50.92,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but it will most certainly blow your mind.

211
0:09:54.12,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Thank you very much.

212
0:09:55.36,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

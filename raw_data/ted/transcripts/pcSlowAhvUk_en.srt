1
0:00:12.855,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There is an entire genre of YouTube videos

2
0:00:15.798,000 --> 0:00:17,000
devoted to an experience which

3
0:00:17.811,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am certain that everyone in this room has had.

4
0:00:20.388,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It entails an individual who,

5
0:00:22.401,000 --> 0:00:23,000
thinking they're alone,

6
0:00:23.964,000 --> 0:00:26,000
engages in some expressive behavior —

7
0:00:27.17,000 --> 0:00:29,000
wild singing, gyrating dancing,

8
0:00:29.677,000 --> 0:00:31,000
some mild sexual activity —

9
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:34,000
only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,

10
0:00:34.878,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that there is a person watching and lurking,

11
0:00:37.923,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the discovery of which causes them

12
0:00:39.678,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to immediately cease what they were doing

13
0:00:41.578,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in horror.

14
0:00:43.468,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The sense of shame and humiliation

15
0:00:45.55,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in their face is palpable.

16
0:00:47.833,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's the sense of,

17
0:00:49.565,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"This is something I'm willing to do

18
0:00:51.298,000 --> 0:00:54,000
only if no one else is watching."

19
0:00:54.898,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This is the crux of the work

20
0:00:57.316,000 --> 0:00:59,000
on which I have been singularly focused

21
0:00:59.363,000 --> 0:01:,000
for the last 16 months,

22
0:01:01.238,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the question of why privacy matters,

23
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a question that has arisen

24
0:01:05.238,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in the context of a global debate,

25
0:01:08.36,000 --> 0:01:1,000
enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden

26
0:01:10.848,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that the United States and its partners,

27
0:01:13.189,000 --> 0:01:15,000
unbeknownst to the entire world,

28
0:01:15.211,000 --> 0:01:17,000
has converted the Internet,

29
0:01:17.303,000 --> 0:01:19,000
once heralded as an unprecedented tool

30
0:01:20.104,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of liberation and democratization,

31
0:01:23.42,000 --> 0:01:24,000
into an unprecedented zone

32
0:01:25.189,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.

33
0:01:29.283,000 --> 0:01:3,000
There is a very common sentiment

34
0:01:31.24,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that arises in this debate,

35
0:01:32.726,000 --> 0:01:33,000
even among people who are uncomfortable

36
0:01:34.683,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with mass surveillance, which says

37
0:01:36.737,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that there is no real harm

38
0:01:38.66,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that comes from this large-scale invasion

39
0:01:41.405,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because only people who are engaged in bad acts

40
0:01:44.679,000 --> 0:01:46,000
have a reason to want to hide

41
0:01:46.748,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and to care about their privacy.

42
0:01:49.459,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This worldview is implicitly grounded

43
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world,

44
0:01:54.416,000 --> 0:01:56,000
good people and bad people.

45
0:01:56.452,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks

46
0:01:59.42,000 --> 0:02:,000
or who engage in violent criminality

47
0:02:00.918,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing,

48
0:02:04.07,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have reasons to care about their privacy.

49
0:02:06.127,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But by contrast, good people

50
0:02:08.95,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are people who go to work,

51
0:02:10.603,000 --> 0:02:12,000
come home, raise their children, watch television.

52
0:02:13.505,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks

53
0:02:16.261,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but to read the news or exchange recipes

54
0:02:18.736,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or to plan their kids' Little League games,

55
0:02:21.21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and those people are doing nothing wrong

56
0:02:23.528,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and therefore have nothing to hide

57
0:02:25.575,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and no reason to fear

58
0:02:27.937,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the government monitoring them.

59
0:02:30.379,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The people who are actually saying that

60
0:02:32.189,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are engaged in a very extreme act

61
0:02:34.968,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of self-deprecation.

62
0:02:36.524,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What they're really saying is,

63
0:02:38.433,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"I have agreed to make myself

64
0:02:40.626,000 --> 0:02:42,000
such a harmless and unthreatening

65
0:02:43.472,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear

66
0:02:46.43,000 --> 0:02:49,000
having the government know what it is that I'm doing."

67
0:02:49.779,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This mindset has found what I think

68
0:02:51.583,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is its purest expression

69
0:02:53.652,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in a 2009 interview with

70
0:02:55.959,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,

71
0:02:58.894,000 --> 0:03:,000
when asked about all the different ways his company

72
0:03:01.436,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is causing invasions of privacy

73
0:03:03.608,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for hundreds of millions of people around the world,

74
0:03:06.217,000 --> 0:03:07,000
said this: He said,

75
0:03:08.208,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"If you're doing something that you don't want

76
0:03:09.884,000 --> 0:03:11,000
other people to know,

77
0:03:11.898,000 --> 0:03:15,000
maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."

78
0:03:15.903,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, there's all kinds of things to say about

79
0:03:17.888,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that mentality,

80
0:03:20.233,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the first of which is that the people who say that,

81
0:03:23.473,000 --> 0:03:25,000
who say that privacy isn't really important,

82
0:03:25.588,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they don't actually believe it,

83
0:03:28.535,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and the way you know that they don't actually believe it

84
0:03:30.357,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter,

85
0:03:33.226,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with their actions, they take all kinds of steps

86
0:03:36.387,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to safeguard their privacy.

87
0:03:39.154,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They put passwords on their email

88
0:03:40.972,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and their social media accounts,

89
0:03:42.742,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they put locks on their bedroom

90
0:03:44.621,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and bathroom doors,

91
0:03:45.97,000 --> 0:03:47,000
all steps designed to prevent other people

92
0:03:48.67,000 --> 0:03:5,000
from entering what they consider their private realm

93
0:03:51.572,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and knowing what it is that they don't want other people to know.

94
0:03:55.273,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,

95
0:03:58.333,000 --> 0:04:,000
ordered his employees at Google

96
0:04:00.942,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to cease speaking with the online

97
0:04:02.877,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Internet magazine CNET

98
0:04:05.15,000 --> 0:04:07,000
after CNET published an article

99
0:04:07.74,000 --> 0:04:09,000
full of personal, private information

100
0:04:09.773,000 --> 0:04:11,000
about Eric Schmidt,

101
0:04:11.854,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which it obtained exclusively through Google searches

102
0:04:14.97,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and using other Google products. (Laughter)

103
0:04:18.311,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This same division can be seen

104
0:04:20.168,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,

105
0:04:22.63,000 --> 0:04:25,000
who in an infamous interview in 2010

106
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
pronounced that privacy is no longer

107
0:04:28.559,000 --> 0:04:31,000
a "social norm."

108
0:04:31.584,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife

109
0:04:34.14,000 --> 0:04:36,000
purchased not only their own house

110
0:04:36.445,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto

111
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for a total of 30 million dollars

112
0:04:41.934,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy

113
0:04:45.466,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that prevented other people from monitoring

114
0:04:47.592,000 --> 0:04:5,000
what they do in their personal lives.

115
0:04:51.191,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world,

116
0:04:53.944,000 --> 0:04:55,000
every single time somebody has said to me,

117
0:04:56.36,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy

118
0:04:57.869,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because I don't have anything to hide."

119
0:04:59.478,000 --> 0:05:,000
I always say the same thing to them.

120
0:05:01.178,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I get out a pen, I write down my email address.

121
0:05:03.471,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I say, "Here's my email address.

122
0:05:05.113,000 --> 0:05:06,000
What I want you to do when you get home

123
0:05:06.812,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is email me the passwords

124
0:05:08.522,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to all of your email accounts,

125
0:05:10.332,000 --> 0:05:12,000
not just the nice, respectable work one in your name,

126
0:05:12.886,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but all of them,

127
0:05:14.436,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because I want to be able to just troll through

128
0:05:16.497,000 --> 0:05:17,000
what it is you're doing online,

129
0:05:18.176,000 --> 0:05:2,000
read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting.

130
0:05:20.738,000 --> 0:05:21,000
After all, if you're not a bad person,

131
0:05:22.538,000 --> 0:05:23,000
if you're doing nothing wrong,

132
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you should have nothing to hide."

133
0:05:27.34,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.

134
0:05:30.873,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I check and — (Applause)

135
0:05:34.878,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I check that email account religiously all the time.

136
0:05:38.118,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's a very desolate place.

137
0:05:41.323,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And there's a reason for that,

138
0:05:43.11,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which is that we as human beings,

139
0:05:45.151,000 --> 0:05:46,000
even those of us who in words

140
0:05:47.105,000 --> 0:05:49,000
disclaim the importance of our own privacy,

141
0:05:49.546,000 --> 0:05:51,000
instinctively understand

142
0:05:51.683,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the profound importance of it.

143
0:05:53.877,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It is true that as human beings, we're social animals,

144
0:05:56.704,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which means we have a need for other people

145
0:05:58.853,000 --> 0:06:,000
to know what we're doing and saying and thinking,

146
0:06:01.597,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online.

147
0:06:05.867,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But equally essential to what it means

148
0:06:08.713,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to be a free and fulfilled human being

149
0:06:11.294,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is to have a place that we can go

150
0:06:13.431,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.

151
0:06:17.459,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There's a reason why we seek that out,

152
0:06:19.466,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and our reason is that all of us —

153
0:06:22.376,000 --> 0:06:25,000
not just terrorists and criminals, all of us —

154
0:06:25.704,000 --> 0:06:27,000
have things to hide.

155
0:06:27.749,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There are all sorts of things that we do and think

156
0:06:30.496,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that we're willing to tell our physician

157
0:06:33.197,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse

158
0:06:36.952,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or our best friend that we would be mortified

159
0:06:39.29,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for the rest of the world to learn.

160
0:06:41.25,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We make judgments every single day

161
0:06:43.452,000 --> 0:06:45,000
about the kinds of things that we say and think and do

162
0:06:45.91,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that we're willing to have other people know,

163
0:06:47.631,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the kinds of things that we say and think and do

164
0:06:49.621,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that we don't want anyone else to know about.

165
0:06:51.95,000 --> 0:06:54,000
People can very easily in words claim

166
0:06:55.277,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that they don't value their privacy,

167
0:06:57.439,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.

168
0:07:02.416,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, there's a reason why privacy is so craved

169
0:07:06.146,000 --> 0:07:07,000
universally and instinctively.

170
0:07:07.89,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It isn't just a reflexive movement

171
0:07:09.777,000 --> 0:07:11,000
like breathing air or drinking water.

172
0:07:12.491,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The reason is that when we're in a state

173
0:07:14.931,000 --> 0:07:16,000
where we can be monitored, where we can be watched,

174
0:07:17.588,000 --> 0:07:19,000
our behavior changes dramatically.

175
0:07:20.264,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The range of behavioral options that we consider

176
0:07:23.297,000 --> 0:07:24,000
when we think we're being watched

177
0:07:25.105,000 --> 0:07:27,000
severely reduce.

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This is just a fact of human nature

179
0:07:29.475,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that has been recognized in social science

180
0:07:31.763,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and in literature and in religion

181
0:07:33.67,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and in virtually every field of discipline.

182
0:07:35.898,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There are dozens of psychological studies

183
0:07:38.68,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that prove that when somebody knows

184
0:07:41.231,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that they might be watched,

185
0:07:42.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the behavior they engage in

186
0:07:44.492,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is vastly more conformist and compliant.

187
0:07:47.974,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Human shame is a very powerful motivator,

188
0:07:51.319,000 --> 0:07:53,000
as is the desire to avoid it,

189
0:07:54.23,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and that's the reason why people,

190
0:07:55.729,000 --> 0:07:57,000
when they're in a state of being watched, make decisions

191
0:07:57.968,000 --> 0:08:,000
not that are the byproduct of their own agency

192
0:08:01.23,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but that are about the expectations

193
0:08:03.242,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that others have of them

194
0:08:04.694,000 --> 0:08:08,000
or the mandates of societal orthodoxy.

195
0:08:09.128,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This realization was exploited most powerfully

196
0:08:11.995,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for pragmatic ends by the 18th- century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,

197
0:08:16.136,000 --> 0:08:18,000
who set out to resolve an important problem

198
0:08:18.487,000 --> 0:08:19,000
ushered in by the industrial age,

199
0:08:20.289,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where, for the first time, institutions had become

200
0:08:22.647,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so large and centralized

201
0:08:24.644,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that they were no longer able to monitor

202
0:08:26.472,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and therefore control each one of their individual members,

203
0:08:29.425,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the solution that he devised

204
0:08:31.306,000 --> 0:08:33,000
was an architectural design

205
0:08:33.509,000 --> 0:08:35,000
originally intended to be implemented in prisons

206
0:08:36.225,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that he called the panopticon,

207
0:08:38.544,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the primary attribute of which was the construction

208
0:08:40.904,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of an enormous tower in the center of the institution

209
0:08:43.975,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where whoever controlled the institution

210
0:08:46.123,000 --> 0:08:48,000
could at any moment watch any of the inmates,

211
0:08:48.808,000 --> 0:08:51,000
although they couldn't watch all of them at all times.

212
0:08:52.13,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And crucial to this design

213
0:08:54.185,000 --> 0:08:55,000
was that the inmates could not actually

214
0:08:55.98,000 --> 0:08:57,000
see into the panopticon, into the tower,

215
0:08:58.856,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and so they never knew

216
0:09:00.528,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if they were being watched or even when.

217
0:09:02.7,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And what made him so excited about this discovery

218
0:09:06.283,000 --> 0:09:07,000
was that that would mean that the prisoners

219
0:09:08.156,000 --> 0:09:11,000
would have to assume that they were being watched

220
0:09:11.184,000 --> 0:09:12,000
at any given moment,

221
0:09:12.869,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which would be the ultimate enforcer

222
0:09:14.747,000 --> 0:09:17,000
for obedience and compliance.

223
0:09:18.425,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault

224
0:09:21.35,000 --> 0:09:22,000
realized that that model could be used

225
0:09:23.275,000 --> 0:09:26,000
not just for prisons but for every institution

226
0:09:26.39,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that seeks to control human behavior:

227
0:09:28.34,000 --> 0:09:3,000
schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.

228
0:09:31.215,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And what he said was that this mindset,

229
0:09:33.413,000 --> 0:09:35,000
this framework discovered by Bentham,

230
0:09:35.839,000 --> 0:09:38,000
was the key means of societal control

231
0:09:39.168,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for modern, Western societies,

232
0:09:41.17,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which no longer need

233
0:09:42.944,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the overt weapons of tyranny —

234
0:09:44.851,000 --> 0:09:46,000
punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,

235
0:09:47.247,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party —

236
0:09:50.561,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because mass surveillance creates

237
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a prison in the mind

238
0:09:55.515,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that is a much more subtle

239
0:09:57.358,000 --> 0:09:58,000
though much more effective means

240
0:09:59.247,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of fostering compliance with social norms

241
0:10:02.296,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or with social orthodoxy,

242
0:10:03.758,000 --> 0:10:04,000
much more effective

243
0:10:05.32,000 --> 0:10:08,000
than brute force could ever be.

244
0:10:08.445,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The most iconic work of literature about surveillance

245
0:10:11.263,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,"

246
0:10:14.813,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which we all learn in school, and therefore it's almost become a cliche.

247
0:10:18.28,000 --> 0:10:2,000
In fact, whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance,

248
0:10:20.349,000 --> 0:10:22,000
people instantaneously dismiss it

249
0:10:22.598,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as inapplicable, and what they say is,

250
0:10:24.9,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Oh, well in '1984,' there were monitors in people's homes,

251
0:10:28.183,000 --> 0:10:3,000
they were being watched at every given moment,

252
0:10:30.348,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face."

253
0:10:34.31,000 --> 0:10:36,000
That is an actual fundamental misapprehension

254
0:10:37.23,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984."

255
0:10:39.931,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The warning that he was issuing

256
0:10:41.582,000 --> 0:10:42,000
was about a surveillance state

257
0:10:43.19,000 --> 0:10:45,000
not that monitored everybody at all times,

258
0:10:45.354,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but where people were aware that they could

259
0:10:47.407,000 --> 0:10:48,000
be monitored at any given moment.

260
0:10:49.036,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Here is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,

261
0:10:52.11,000 --> 0:10:54,000
described the surveillance system

262
0:10:54.15,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that they faced:

263
0:10:55.548,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"There was, of course, no way of knowing

264
0:10:57.975,000 --> 0:10:59,000
whether you were being watched at any given moment."

265
0:11:00.292,000 --> 0:11:01,000
He went on to say,

266
0:11:01.743,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"At any rate, they could plug in your wire

267
0:11:03.454,000 --> 0:11:04,000
whenever they wanted to.

268
0:11:05.163,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You had to live, did live,

269
0:11:07.742,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from habit that became instinct,

270
0:11:09.995,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in the assumption that every sound you made

271
0:11:12.49,000 --> 0:11:14,000
was overheard and except in darkness

272
0:11:14.68,000 --> 0:11:16,000
every movement scrutinized."

273
0:11:17.419,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The Abrahamic religions similarly posit

274
0:11:20.765,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that there's an invisible, all-knowing authority

275
0:11:23.708,000 --> 0:11:24,000
who, because of its omniscience,

276
0:11:25.451,000 --> 0:11:26,000
always watches whatever you're doing,

277
0:11:27.347,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which means you never have a private moment,

278
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the ultimate enforcer

279
0:11:31.804,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for obedience to its dictates.

280
0:11:34.794,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What all of these seemingly disparate works

281
0:11:38.198,000 --> 0:11:4,000
recognize, the conclusion that they all reach,

282
0:11:40.984,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is that a society in which people

283
0:11:43.306,000 --> 0:11:45,000
can be monitored at all times

284
0:11:45.613,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is a society that breeds conformity

285
0:11:48.268,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and obedience and submission,

286
0:11:50.51,000 --> 0:11:51,000
which is why every tyrant,

287
0:11:52.021,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the most overt to the most subtle,

288
0:11:54.103,000 --> 0:11:56,000
craves that system.

289
0:11:56.366,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Conversely, even more importantly,

290
0:11:59.02,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it is a realm of privacy,

291
0:12:01.46,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the ability to go somewhere where we can think

292
0:12:04.47,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and reason and interact and speak

293
0:12:07.628,000 --> 0:12:1,000
without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us,

294
0:12:11.282,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in which creativity and exploration

295
0:12:14.825,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and dissent exclusively reside,

296
0:12:17.853,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that is the reason why,

297
0:12:19.674,000 --> 0:12:21,000
when we allow a society to exist

298
0:12:22.25,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in which we're subject to constant monitoring,

299
0:12:24.413,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we allow the essence of human freedom

300
0:12:27.39,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to be severely crippled.

301
0:12:30.341,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The last point I want to observe about this mindset,

302
0:12:33.463,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the idea that only people who are doing something wrong

303
0:12:35.388,000 --> 0:12:38,000
have things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy,

304
0:12:39.27,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is that it entrenches two very destructive messages,

305
0:12:43.276,000 --> 0:12:45,000
two destructive lessons,

306
0:12:45.304,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the first of which is that

307
0:12:47.06,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the only people who care about privacy,

308
0:12:49.18,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the only people who will seek out privacy,

309
0:12:51.236,000 --> 0:12:55,000
are by definition bad people.

310
0:12:55.311,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This is a conclusion that we should have

311
0:12:57.443,000 --> 0:12:59,000
all kinds of reasons for avoiding,

312
0:12:59.971,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the most important of which is that when you say,

313
0:13:02.723,000 --> 0:13:04,000
"somebody who is doing bad things,"

314
0:13:05.1,000 --> 0:13:07,000
you probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack

315
0:13:07.937,000 --> 0:13:09,000
or engaging in violent criminality,

316
0:13:09.978,000 --> 0:13:11,000
a much narrower conception

317
0:13:12.518,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of what people who wield power mean

318
0:13:14.97,000 --> 0:13:16,000
when they say, "doing bad things."

319
0:13:17.02,000 --> 0:13:19,000
For them, "doing bad things" typically means

320
0:13:19.327,000 --> 0:13:22,000
doing something that poses meaningful challenges

321
0:13:22.398,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to the exercise of our own power.

322
0:13:25.503,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The other really destructive

323
0:13:27.453,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and, I think, even more insidious lesson

324
0:13:29.361,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that comes from accepting this mindset

325
0:13:32.14,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is there's an implicit bargain

326
0:13:34.906,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that people who accept this mindset have accepted,

327
0:13:38.25,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and that bargain is this:

328
0:13:39.705,000 --> 0:13:4,000
If you're willing to render yourself

329
0:13:41.677,000 --> 0:13:43,000
sufficiently harmless,

330
0:13:43.779,000 --> 0:13:45,000
sufficiently unthreatening

331
0:13:45.949,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to those who wield political power,

332
0:13:47.831,000 --> 0:13:5,000
then and only then can you be free

333
0:13:50.867,000 --> 0:13:52,000
of the dangers of surveillance.

334
0:13:52.975,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's only those who are dissidents,

335
0:13:55.36,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who challenge power,

336
0:13:56.841,000 --> 0:13:57,000
who have something to worry about.

337
0:13:58.653,000 --> 0:14:01,000
There are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well.

338
0:14:02.06,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You may be a person who, right now,

339
0:14:04.298,000 --> 0:14:06,000
doesn't want to engage in that behavior,

340
0:14:06.37,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but at some point in the future you might.

341
0:14:08.825,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Even if you're somebody who decides

342
0:14:10.499,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that you never want to,

343
0:14:12.264,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the fact that there are other people

344
0:14:13.898,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who are willing to and able to resist

345
0:14:16.102,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and be adversarial to those in power —

346
0:14:18.136,000 --> 0:14:19,000
dissidents and journalists

347
0:14:19.67,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and activists and a whole range of others —

348
0:14:21.758,000 --> 0:14:23,000
is something that brings us all collective good

349
0:14:24.252,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that we should want to preserve.

350
0:14:27.23,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Equally critical is that the measure

351
0:14:29.324,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of how free a society is

352
0:14:31.587,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is not how it treats its good,

353
0:14:33.737,000 --> 0:14:35,000
obedient, compliant citizens,

354
0:14:36.2,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but how it treats its dissidents

355
0:14:38.04,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and those who resist orthodoxy.

356
0:14:41.155,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But the most important reason

357
0:14:42.752,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is that a system of mass surveillance

358
0:14:45.153,000 --> 0:14:47,000
suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.

359
0:14:47.77,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It renders off-limits

360
0:14:49.571,000 --> 0:14:51,000
all kinds of behavioral choices

361
0:14:51.577,000 --> 0:14:54,000
without our even knowing that it's happened.

362
0:14:55.13,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg

363
0:14:57.612,000 --> 0:14:59,000
once said, "He who does not move

364
0:15:00.105,000 --> 0:15:03,000
does not notice his chains."

365
0:15:03.461,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We can try and render the chains

366
0:15:05.15,000 --> 0:15:08,000
of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,

367
0:15:08.239,000 --> 0:15:1,000
but the constraints that it imposes on us

368
0:15:10.905,000 --> 0:15:12,000
do not become any less potent.

369
0:15:13.45,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Thank you very much.

370
0:15:15.058,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

371
0:15:16.489,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Thank you.

372
0:15:17.996,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

373
0:15:22.893,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Thank you.

374
0:15:25.28,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

375
0:15:31.32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Bruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.

376
0:15:33.612,000 --> 0:15:35,000
The case is rather convincing, I have to say,

377
0:15:35.901,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but I want to bring you back

378
0:15:37.466,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden

379
0:15:40.817,000 --> 0:15:42,000
for a few questions, if you don't mind.

380
0:15:42.882,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The first one is personal to you.

381
0:15:45.37,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We have all read about the arrest of your partner,

382
0:15:48.411,000 --> 0:15:51,000
David Miranda in London, and other difficulties,

383
0:15:51.721,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but I assume that

384
0:15:53.805,000 --> 0:15:56,000
in terms of personal engagement and risk,

385
0:15:57.161,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that the pressure on you is not that easy

386
0:15:58.965,000 --> 0:16:,000
to take on the biggest sovereign organizations in the world.

387
0:16:01.91,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Tell us a little bit about that.

388
0:16:04.345,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Glenn Greenwald: You know, I think one of the things that happens

389
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is that people's courage in this regard

390
0:16:07.932,000 --> 0:16:08,000
gets contagious,

391
0:16:09.644,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working

392
0:16:13.107,000 --> 0:16:14,000
were certainly aware of the risk —

393
0:16:14.643,000 --> 0:16:16,000
the United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world

394
0:16:17.365,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and doesn't appreciate it when you

395
0:16:19.363,000 --> 0:16:2,000
disclose thousands of their secrets

396
0:16:21.285,000 --> 0:16:23,000
on the Internet at will —

397
0:16:23.796,000 --> 0:16:26,000
seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old

398
0:16:27.265,000 --> 0:16:29,000
ordinary person who grew up in

399
0:16:29.284,000 --> 0:16:31,000
a very ordinary environment

400
0:16:31.597,000 --> 0:16:34,000
exercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked,

401
0:16:35.32,000 --> 0:16:37,000
knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life

402
0:16:37.54,000 --> 0:16:38,000
or that his life would unravel,

403
0:16:39.322,000 --> 0:16:4,000
inspired me and inspired other journalists

404
0:16:41.297,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and inspired, I think, people around the world,

405
0:16:43.12,000 --> 0:16:44,000
including future whistleblowers,

406
0:16:44.808,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well.

407
0:16:48.323,000 --> 0:16:5,000
BG: I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden,

408
0:16:50.809,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because you have spoken with him a lot,

409
0:16:53.99,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and you certainly continue doing so,

410
0:16:55.753,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but in your book, you never call him Edward,

411
0:16:58.389,000 --> 0:17:01,000
nor Ed, you say "Snowden." How come?

412
0:17:01.849,000 --> 0:17:02,000
GG: You know, I'm sure that's something

413
0:17:03.493,000 --> 0:17:06,000
for a team of psychologists to examine. (Laughter)

414
0:17:06.824,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I don't really know. The reason I think that,

415
0:17:10.413,000 --> 0:17:13,000
one of the important objectives that he actually had,

416
0:17:13.967,000 --> 0:17:15,000
one of his, I think, most important tactics,

417
0:17:16.303,000 --> 0:17:18,000
was that he knew that one of the ways

418
0:17:18.51,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to distract attention from the substance of the revelations

419
0:17:21.2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
would be to try and personalize the focus on him,

420
0:17:23.85,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and for that reason, he stayed out of the media.

421
0:17:25.917,000 --> 0:17:27,000
He tried not to ever have his personal life

422
0:17:28.426,000 --> 0:17:29,000
subject to examination,

423
0:17:30.105,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and so I think calling him Snowden

424
0:17:32.819,000 --> 0:17:35,000
is a way of just identifying him as this important historical actor

425
0:17:36.393,000 --> 0:17:37,000
rather than trying to personalize him in a way

426
0:17:38.265,000 --> 0:17:4,000
that might distract attention from the substance.

427
0:17:41.145,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Moderator: So his revelations, your analysis,

428
0:17:42.602,000 --> 0:17:43,000
the work of other journalists,

429
0:17:44.378,000 --> 0:17:47,000
have really developed the debate,

430
0:17:47.378,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and many governments, for example, have reacted,

431
0:17:49.506,000 --> 0:17:51,000
including in Brazil, with projects and programs

432
0:17:52.11,000 --> 0:17:54,000
to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.

433
0:17:54.964,000 --> 0:17:56,000
There are a lot of things going on in that sense.

434
0:17:57.716,000 --> 0:17:59,000
But I'm wondering, for you personally,

435
0:17:59.986,000 --> 0:18:,000
what is the endgame?

436
0:18:01.637,000 --> 0:18:02,000
At what point will you think,

437
0:18:03.27,000 --> 0:18:06,000
well, actually, we've succeeded in moving the dial?

438
0:18:06.462,000 --> 0:18:08,000
GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist

439
0:18:08.74,000 --> 0:18:1,000
is very simple, which is to make sure

440
0:18:11.183,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that every single document that's newsworthy

441
0:18:13.195,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and that ought to be disclosed

442
0:18:14.841,000 --> 0:18:15,000
ends up being disclosed,

443
0:18:16.321,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place

444
0:18:18.358,000 --> 0:18:19,000
end up uncovered.

445
0:18:19.833,000 --> 0:18:2,000
To me, that's the essence of journalism

446
0:18:21.68,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and that's what I'm committed to doing.

447
0:18:23.207,000 --> 0:18:25,000
As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious

448
0:18:25.681,000 --> 0:18:27,000
for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,

449
0:18:27.868,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I mean, I look at this as work that will never end

450
0:18:30.394,000 --> 0:18:32,000
until governments around the world

451
0:18:32.571,000 --> 0:18:34,000
are no longer able to subject entire populations

452
0:18:35.19,000 --> 0:18:36,000
to monitoring and surveillance

453
0:18:36.676,000 --> 0:18:38,000
unless they convince some court or some entity

454
0:18:39.265,000 --> 0:18:4,000
that the person they've targeted

455
0:18:40.987,000 --> 0:18:42,000
has actually done something wrong.

456
0:18:43.578,000 --> 0:18:46,000
To me, that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated.

457
0:18:46.813,000 --> 0:18:48,000
BG: So Snowden is very, as we've seen at TED,

458
0:18:49.159,000 --> 0:18:51,000
is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself

459
0:18:51.927,000 --> 0:18:53,000
as a defender of democratic values

460
0:18:54.207,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and democratic principles.

461
0:18:55.92,000 --> 0:18:58,000
But then, many people really find it difficult to believe

462
0:18:58.948,000 --> 0:19:,000
that those are his only motivations.

463
0:19:01.35,000 --> 0:19:02,000
They find it difficult to believe

464
0:19:02.828,000 --> 0:19:03,000
that there was no money involved,

465
0:19:04.449,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that he didn't sell some of those secrets,

466
0:19:06.36,000 --> 0:19:07,000
even to China and to Russia,

467
0:19:08.189,000 --> 0:19:1,000
which are clearly not the best friends

468
0:19:10.733,000 --> 0:19:12,000
of the United States right now.

469
0:19:12.902,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And I'm sure many people in the room

470
0:19:14.608,000 --> 0:19:16,000
are wondering the same question.

471
0:19:16.878,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Do you consider it possible there is

472
0:19:18.761,000 --> 0:19:2,000
that part of Snowden we've not seen yet?

473
0:19:21.373,000 --> 0:19:24,000
GG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.

474
0:19:24.554,000 --> 0:19:26,000
(Laughter) If you wanted to,

475
0:19:26.968,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and I know you're just playing devil's advocate,

476
0:19:29.43,000 --> 0:19:32,000
but if you wanted to sell

477
0:19:32.641,000 --> 0:19:33,000
secrets to another country,

478
0:19:34.547,000 --> 0:19:35,000
which he could have done and become

479
0:19:36.264,000 --> 0:19:37,000
extremely rich doing so,

480
0:19:37.91,000 --> 0:19:38,000
the last thing you would do is take those secrets

481
0:19:39.891,000 --> 0:19:41,000
and give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them,

482
0:19:42.635,000 --> 0:19:44,000
because it makes those secrets worthless.

483
0:19:44.661,000 --> 0:19:45,000
People who want to enrich themselves

484
0:19:46.309,000 --> 0:19:47,000
do it secretly by selling secrets to the government,

485
0:19:48.279,000 --> 0:19:49,000
but I think there's one important point worth making,

486
0:19:50.1,000 --> 0:19:52,000
which is, that accusation comes from

487
0:19:52.338,000 --> 0:19:53,000
people in the U.S. government,

488
0:19:54.17,000 --> 0:19:56,000
from people in the media who are loyalists

489
0:19:56.19,000 --> 0:19:57,000
to these various governments,

490
0:19:57.788,000 --> 0:20:,000
and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people —

491
0:20:00.936,000 --> 0:20:01,000
"Oh, he can't really be doing this

492
0:20:02.541,000 --> 0:20:03,000
for principled reasons,

493
0:20:04.206,000 --> 0:20:06,000
he must have some corrupt, nefarious reason" —

494
0:20:06.448,000 --> 0:20:08,000
they're saying a lot more about themselves

495
0:20:08.555,000 --> 0:20:09,000
than they are the target of their accusations,

496
0:20:10.381,000 --> 0:20:14,000
because — (Applause) —

497
0:20:14.766,000 --> 0:20:16,000
those people, the ones who make that accusation,

498
0:20:17.286,000 --> 0:20:18,000
they themselves never act

499
0:20:19.19,000 --> 0:20:2,000
for any reason other than corrupt reasons,

500
0:20:21.112,000 --> 0:20:22,000
so they assume

501
0:20:22.744,000 --> 0:20:24,000
that everybody else is plagued by the same disease

502
0:20:25.376,000 --> 0:20:27,000
of soullessness as they are,

503
0:20:27.378,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and so that's the assumption.

504
0:20:29.249,000 --> 0:20:3,000
(Applause)

505
0:20:30.876,000 --> 0:20:32,000
BG: Glenn, thank you very much. GG: Thank you very much.

506
0:20:33.36,000 --> 0:20:35,000
BG: Glenn Greenwald.

507
0:20:35.692,000 --> 0:20:36,000
(Applause)

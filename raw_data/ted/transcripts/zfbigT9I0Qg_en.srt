1
0:00:13.896,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"Five hospitals in Aleppo have been bombed."

2
0:00:17.952,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That was a text message that I received on a dark winter night in November 2016.

3
0:00:23.877,000 --> 0:00:25,000
One of them was a children's hospital

4
0:00:26.567,000 --> 0:00:27,000
run by my Syrian colleagues

5
0:00:27.909,000 --> 0:00:29,000
at the Independent Doctors Association, IDA.

6
0:00:31.726,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It was the sixth time it had been bombed.

7
0:00:35.644,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage of the head nurse, Malak,

8
0:00:38.838,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in the aftermath of the bombing,

9
0:00:40.455,000 --> 0:00:42,000
grabbing premature babies out of their incubators,

10
0:00:43.209,000 --> 0:00:45,000
desperate to get them to safety,

11
0:00:45.775,000 --> 0:00:47,000
before she broke down in tears.

12
0:00:48.982,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I felt devastated.

13
0:00:51.3,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Fellow humanitarians and I have spent blood, sweat and tears

14
0:00:55.1,000 --> 0:00:56,000
rebuilding hospitals

15
0:00:56.593,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so that our patients may live, not die.

16
0:01:01.238,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And through this work, I made a discovery.

17
0:01:05.574,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The reason that people survive in crisis

18
0:01:08.089,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is because of the remarkable work of the people in crisis themselves.

19
0:01:13.703,000 --> 0:01:16,000
People survive because of the local doctors, nurses and aid workers

20
0:01:17.337,000 --> 0:01:2,000
who are from the very heart of the affected community,

21
0:01:20.489,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the people who dare to work where others can't or won't.

22
0:01:24.99,000 --> 0:01:27,000
People survive because of people like Malak,

23
0:01:28.331,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who, despite sustaining a severe burns injury in the line of duty,

24
0:01:32.141,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the first thing she did when discharged from hospital

25
0:01:34.974,000 --> 0:01:36,000
was to go back caring for small children.

26
0:01:38.338,000 --> 0:01:4,000
From the rubble of death and devastation

27
0:01:41.237,000 --> 0:01:44,000
arise the most gallant and noble human beings.

28
0:01:45.157,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Local humanitarians are the beacons of light

29
0:01:48.458,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in the darkness of war.

30
0:01:51.508,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, the data shows that Syrian organizations carry out

31
0:01:54.846,000 --> 0:01:57,000
75 percent of the humanitarian work in Syria.

32
0:01:59.051,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Yet, they receive 0.3 percent of the Syria aid budget.

33
0:02:05.895,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And what's more, the same is happening across the crises of the world.

34
0:02:11.204,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I have witnessed this reality.

35
0:02:13.763,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It means those with the knowledge, skill and ability

36
0:02:16.361,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to respond on the front lines

37
0:02:17.89,000 --> 0:02:2,000
have little of the necessary tools, equipment and resources

38
0:02:21.152,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they need to save lives.

39
0:02:23.275,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It means groups like IDA don't have funds to rebuild their hospital.

40
0:02:28.188,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The humanitarian system is failing the most vulnerable communities

41
0:02:32.093,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in their darkest hours.

42
0:02:35.442,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, at the time of receiving that message,

43
0:02:37.474,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I was on sabbatical from my clinical work,

44
0:02:39.515,000 --> 0:02:4,000
setting up CanDo,

45
0:02:40.704,000 --> 0:02:42,000
a start-up determined to address this imbalance

46
0:02:43.371,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and enable local responders to provide health care

47
0:02:45.886,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to their war-devastated communities.

48
0:02:48.609,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We had devised a simple model:

49
0:02:51.101,000 --> 0:02:54,000
source trusted and impactful local groups,

50
0:02:54.196,000 --> 0:02:56,000
support their development through an accelerator program

51
0:02:57.206,000 --> 0:03:,000
and connect them to you via our crowdfunding platform,

52
0:03:01.083,000 --> 0:03:03,000
where they can fund-raise for their health needs.

53
0:03:03.889,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So when IDA asked for help,

54
0:03:05.768,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I decided to launch CanDo seven months early,

55
0:03:09.561,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with very little money,

56
0:03:11.18,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and many people, including myself, thought I had finally gone mad.

57
0:03:17.839,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I wanted to do something that transformed our collective anger

58
0:03:22.188,000 --> 0:03:24,000
into something beautiful.

59
0:03:24.704,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And that's how the People's Convoy was born.

60
0:03:27.512,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It was a global crowdfunding campaign

61
0:03:29.353,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to enable IDA to rebuild a whole new children's hospital,

62
0:03:32.964,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and, if successful, we the people would take the medical equipment

63
0:03:37.417,000 --> 0:03:4,000
all the way from London to the Syria border.

64
0:03:40.467,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And we did it.

65
0:03:42.309,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Thousands of people came together from across the world

66
0:03:45.031,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to achieve a global first:

67
0:03:47.19,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we built the first-ever crowdfunded hospital.

68
0:03:50.918,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The location was carefully chosen by the local experts, IDA,

69
0:03:54.506,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where they knew it would be safe

70
0:03:56.22,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and serve the greatest number of displaced children.

71
0:04:00.188,000 --> 0:04:02,000
IDA was so moved by people's response,

72
0:04:02.981,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they named it "Hope Hospital."

73
0:04:05.714,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's been open for exactly one year,

74
0:04:07.778,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they have treated over 15,000 children.

75
0:04:11.388,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Applause)

76
0:04:17.282,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We can provide lifesaving assistance in the most volatile places on earth.

77
0:04:22.099,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The system needs to change,

78
0:04:23.896,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and change starts with us all sharing a new humanitarian vision,

79
0:04:29.458,000 --> 0:04:33,000
one where you, global citizens with skills, expertise and resources,

80
0:04:33.839,000 --> 0:04:36,000
stand together with the local responders;

81
0:04:37.101,000 --> 0:04:4,000
one where we are all humanitarians,

82
0:04:40.538,000 --> 0:04:43,000
putting the necessary resources in the hands of those who need them most

83
0:04:44.315,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and are best placed to use them effectively and efficiently.

84
0:04:48.839,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We need to support the people who are not only saving lives now,

85
0:04:52.466,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but it will also be them stitching their wounded communities back together,

86
0:04:56.791,000 --> 0:04:58,000
once a conflict is over to help them heal.

87
0:05:00.392,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Local humanitarians have the courage to persist,

88
0:05:04.696,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to dust themselves off from the wreckage

89
0:05:06.691,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and to start again, risking their lives to save others.

90
0:05:10.03,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And we can match their courage by not looking away or turning our backs,

91
0:05:15.966,000 --> 0:05:17,000
by helping those who are helping themselves,

92
0:05:18.561,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and together, save more lives.

93
0:05:21.956,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Thank you.

94
0:05:23.131,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Applause)

95
0:05:24.35,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Cheers)

96
0:05:25.534,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

97
0:05:29.964,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Shoham Arad: Come over here, please.

98
0:05:32.538,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why are hospitals being bombed?

99
0:05:34.966,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Rola Hallam: Yeah, good question.

100
0:05:36.592,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So, Physicians for Human Rights have documented

101
0:05:39.602,000 --> 0:05:4,000
nearly 500 attacks on hospitals

102
0:05:41.261,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and over 800 medical personnel who have been killed --

103
0:05:44.037,000 --> 0:05:47,000
over 90 percent of it by the Syrian regime --

104
0:05:47.529,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they say this is part of a systemic targeting

105
0:05:50.547,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and destruction of health care,

106
0:05:52.057,000 --> 0:05:53,000
using it as a weapon of war.

107
0:05:54.209,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the thing with this is that it's not just our problem,

108
0:05:56.959,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it's yours, too, and everyone's,

109
0:05:58.514,000 --> 0:06:,000
because A, it exacerbates the refugee situation --

110
0:06:00.891,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when you have a decimated health care system,

111
0:06:03.043,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it means the next Ebola-type epicenter of disease is going to be Syria;

112
0:06:07.167,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and unfortunately, it sets a very dangerous precedent

113
0:06:09.956,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that makes all of our hospitals anywhere in the world dangerous,

114
0:06:13.444,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and that is not how it should be.

115
0:06:15.246,000 --> 0:06:17,000
SA: So this actually isn't just about money, either,

116
0:06:17.723,000 --> 0:06:18,000
CanDo isn't just about money.

117
0:06:19.145,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Tell me what it means to you that 5,000 people all over the world

118
0:06:22.894,000 --> 0:06:26,000
contributed 350,000 dollars to build Hope Hospital.

119
0:06:28.3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
RH: I think the answer is in that word, it's in hope.

120
0:06:31.728,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I think everyone who donated, they had their faith in humanity renewed,

121
0:06:36.192,000 --> 0:06:38,000
knowing there are people like IDA and those doctors,

122
0:06:38.887,000 --> 0:06:4,000
who are exhibiting the absolute best of humanity,

123
0:06:41.427,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it was like an absolute reciprocation.

124
0:06:43.665,000 --> 0:06:46,000
IDA and these Syrians and many people in places of conflict

125
0:06:47.236,000 --> 0:06:49,000
feel very unheard and unseen.

126
0:06:49.363,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I think the fact that --

127
0:06:50.744,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and they see things through the prism of government,

128
0:06:53.185,000 --> 0:06:54,000
so when they see government's not acting,

129
0:06:55.173,000 --> 0:06:57,000
they assume everyone who lives in those places doesn't care.

130
0:06:58.03,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So when they see that display,

131
0:06:59.706,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it really does just renew everyone's faith in humanity.

132
0:07:02.683,000 --> 0:07:03,000
SA: Thank you, Rola.

133
0:07:03.866,000 --> 0:07:05,000
RH: Thank you. SA: Thank you for everything.

134
0:07:05.968,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
[were] fighting.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So there was no job, no food.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Children, most of them,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
became very malnourished, like this.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
always in a civil war,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the ones affected most [are] the women and children.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So our patients are women and children.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And they are in our backyard.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's our home. We welcome them.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's the camp that we have in now

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
90,000 people,

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where 75 percent of them are women and children.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because people need some help.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There is no government to protect them.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
maybe more or less.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But sometimes we are only five doctors

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and 16 nurses,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But we take the severe ones,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and we reschedule the other ones the next day.

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It is very tough.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's the women who come into the hospitals;

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's the women [are] building the houses.

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That's their house.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And we have a school. This is our bright --

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where we have 850 children,

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the majority are women and girls.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Applause)

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
PM: And the doctors have some very big rules

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
about who can get treated at the clinic.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Would you explain the rules for admission?

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
HA: The people who are coming to us,

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
we are welcoming.

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We are sharing with them

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
whatever we have.

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But there are only two rules.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
First rule:

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
there is no clan distinguished and political division

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in Somali society.

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The second:

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
no man can beat his wife.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If he beat,

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we will put [him] in jail,

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we will call the eldest people.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Until they identify this case,

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we'll never release him.

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That's our two rules.

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Applause)

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The other thing that I have realized,

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that the woman is the most strong person

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
all over the world.

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Because the last 20 years,

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the Somali woman has stood up.

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They were the leaders,

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we are the leaders

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of our community

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the hope of our future generations.

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We are not just the helpless

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the victims of the civil war.

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We can reconcile.

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We can do everything.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the men are only killing in Somalia.

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we came up with these two rules.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In a camp with 90,000 people,

75
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So there is no clan division,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and no man can beat his wife.

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we have a little storage room

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
where we converted a jail.

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Applause)

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity --

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we are there for them. They are not alone for this.

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
PM: You're running a medical clinic.

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It brought much, much needed medical care

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to people who wouldn't get it.

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You're also running a civil society.

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
You've created your own rules,

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in which women and children

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
are getting a different sense of security.

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and your decision, Dr. Mohamed,

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to work together --

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
for you to become a doctor

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and to work with your mother in these circumstances.

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
HA: My age --

97
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because I was born in 1947 --

98
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we were having, at that time,

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
government, law and order.

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But one day, I went to the hospital --

101
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
my mother was sick --

102
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,

103
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
how they [are] committed

104
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to help the sick people.

105
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I admired them,

106
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and I decided to become a doctor.

107
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
My mother died, unfortunately,

108
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when I was 12 years [old].

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Then my father allowed me

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to proceed [with] my hope.

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
My mother died

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
in [a] gynecology complication,

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so I decided to become

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
a gynecology specialist.

115
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That's why I became a doctor.

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So Dr. Deqo has to explain.

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child

118
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Maybe I should become an historian,

120
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or maybe a reporter.

121
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I loved it, but it didn't work.

122
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When the war broke out -- civil war --

123
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I saw how my mother was helping

124
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and how she really needed the help,

125
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and how the care is essential to the woman

126
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to be a woman doctor in Somalia

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and help the women and children.

128
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So I went to Russia, and my mother also,

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.

132
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So some of our character,

133
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.

134
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
My sister was different.

136
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
She's here. She's also a doctor.

137
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
She graduated in Russia also.

138
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Applause)

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And to go back and to work with our mother

140
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is just what we saw in the civil war --

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when I was 16, and my sister was 11,

142
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
when the civil war broke out.

143
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So it was the need and the people we saw

144
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the early '90s --

145
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that's what made us go back

146
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and work for them.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
PM: So what is the biggest challenge

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
working, mother and daughter,

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in such dangerous

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and sometimes scary situations?

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
very dangerous.

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And when I saw the people who needed me,

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I was staying with them to help,

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because I [could] do something for them.

156
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Most people fled abroad.

157
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But I remained with those people,

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I was trying to do something --

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
[any] little thing I [could] do.

160
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I succeeded in my place.

161
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now my place is 90,000 people

162
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
who are respecting each other,

163
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
who are not fighting.

164
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But we try to stand on our feet,

165
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to do something, little things, we can for our people.

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I'm thankful for my daughters.

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When they come to me,

168
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they help me to treat the people,

169
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to help.

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They do everything for them.

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They have done what I desire to do for them.

172
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
PM: What's the best part

173
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of working with your mother,

174
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and the most challenging part for you?

175
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.

176
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
She always expects us to do more.

177
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And really when you think [you] cannot do it,

178
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
she will push you, and I can do it.

179
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
That's the best part.

180
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
She shows us, trains us how to do

181
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and how to be better [people]

182
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and how to do long hours in surgery --

183
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
300 patients per day,

184
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
10, 20 surgeries,

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and still you have to manage the camp --

186
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that's how she trains us.

187
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It is not like beautiful offices here,

188
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
20 patients, you're tired.

189
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries

190
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and 90,000 people to manage.

191
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
PM: But you do it for good reasons.

192
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Applause)

193
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Wait. Wait.

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
HA: Thank you.

195
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
DM: Thank you.

196
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

197
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when you're faced with a complex problem?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So, I hope to convince you that complex

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
doesn't always equal complicated.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is complex,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is complicated.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So here's a food web,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or a map of feeding links between species

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And this is what happens to that food web

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
All the grayed-out species disappear.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
These effects were all unanticipated,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I want to share with you a couple key insights

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about complexity we're learning from studying nature

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that maybe are applicable to other problems.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
First is the simple power of good visualization tools

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to help untangle complexity

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or the interconnections of habitat patches

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The next thing is that if you want to predict

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the effect of one species on another,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
if you focus only on that link,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and then you black box the rest,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it's actually less predictable

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and from that place,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And we're discovering, with our research,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that's often very local to the node you care about

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
within one or two degrees.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
courtesy of the U.S. government.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Instantly ridiculed by the media

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for being so crazy complicated.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the stated goal was to increase popular support

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for the Afghan government.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Clearly a complex problem,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but is it complicated?

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I can sink my teeth into this."

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
popular support for the government.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
three degrees away from that node

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Within that sphere,

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and a very small minority are actual military actions.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and fair, transparent economic development

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and provisioning of services.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in 24 seconds.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because simple answers may emerge.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
on the other side of complexity.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the better chance you have of zooming in

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
on the simple details that matter most.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Thank you.

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Applause)

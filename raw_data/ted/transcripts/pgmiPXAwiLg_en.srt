1
0:00:13.03,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.499,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I set out on a mission to find God.

3
0:00:17.985,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, I'm going to tell you right up front that I failed,

4
0:00:20.673,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which, as a lawyer,

5
0:00:22.283,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is a really hard thing for me to admit.

6
0:00:25.194,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But on that failed journey,

7
0:00:27.798,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a lot of what I found was enlightening.

8
0:00:30.873,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And one thing in particular gave me a lot of hope.

9
0:00:34.378,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It has to do with the magnitude and significance of our differences.

10
0:00:39.616,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, I was raised in America by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu,

11
0:00:43.465,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but practicing a strict and relatively unknown religion outside of India

12
0:00:47.831,000 --> 0:00:48,000
called Jainism.

13
0:00:49.61,000 --> 0:00:51,000
To give you an idea of just how minority that makes me:

14
0:00:53.233,000 --> 0:00:57,000
people from India represent roughly one percent of the US population;

15
0:00:57.973,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Hindus, about 0.7 percent;

16
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Jains, at most .00046 percent.

17
0:01:07.557,000 --> 0:01:08,000
To put that in context:

18
0:01:09.513,000 --> 0:01:12,000
more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year

19
0:01:12.716,000 --> 0:01:14,000
than are followers of the Jain religion in America.

20
0:01:15.455,000 --> 0:01:17,000
To add to my minority mix, my parents then decided,

21
0:01:18.38,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"What a great idea! Let's send her to Catholic school" --

22
0:01:21.098,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:22.14,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where my sister and I were the only non-white,

24
0:01:24.343,000 --> 0:01:26,000
non-Catholic students in the entire school.

25
0:01:27.287,000 --> 0:01:31,000
At the Infant Jesus of Prague School in Flossmoor, Illinois --

26
0:01:31.635,000 --> 0:01:33,000
yes, that's really what it was called --

27
0:01:34.131,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we were taught to believe that there is a single Supreme Being

28
0:01:37.839,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who is responsible for everything,

29
0:01:40.071,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the whole shebang,

30
0:01:41.325,000 --> 0:01:45,000
from the creation of the Universe to moral shepherding to eternal life.

31
0:01:46.023,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But at home,

32
0:01:47.198,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was being taught something entirely different.

33
0:01:50.78,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Followers of the Jain religion

34
0:01:52.485,000 --> 0:01:54,000
don't believe in a single Supreme Being

35
0:01:54.618,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or even a team of Supreme Beings.

36
0:01:56.747,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Instead, we're taught that God manifests

37
0:01:58.81,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as the perfection of each of us as individuals,

38
0:02:01.836,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and that we're actually spending our entire lives

39
0:02:04.344,000 --> 0:02:05,000
striving to remove the bad karmas

40
0:02:06.247,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that stand in the way of us becoming our own godlike, perfect selves.

41
0:02:11.329,000 --> 0:02:14,000
On top of that, one of the core principles of Jainism

42
0:02:14.641,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is something called "non-absolutism."

43
0:02:17.771,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Non-absolutists believe that no single person

44
0:02:20.751,000 --> 0:02:23,000
can hold ownership or knowledge of absolute truth,

45
0:02:24.875,000 --> 0:02:26,000
even when it comes to religious beliefs.

46
0:02:28.169,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Good luck testing that concept out

47
0:02:30.138,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on the priests and nuns in your Catholic school.

48
0:02:32.593,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33.933,000 --> 0:02:34,000
No wonder I was confused

50
0:02:35.734,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and hyperaware of how different I was from my peers.

51
0:02:39.893,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Cut to 20-something years later,

52
0:02:41.867,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I found myself to be a highly spiritual person,

53
0:02:44.774,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but I was floundering.

54
0:02:46.352,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was spiritually homeless.

55
0:02:48.633,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I came to learn that I was a "None,"

56
0:02:51.836,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which isn't an acronym or a clever play on words,

57
0:02:54.998,000 --> 0:02:56,000
nor is it one of these.

58
0:02:57.663,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's simply the painfully uninspired name

59
0:03:00.401,000 --> 0:03:03,000
given to everyone who checks off the box "none"

60
0:03:04.168,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when Pew Research asks them about their religious affiliation.

61
0:03:07.54,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:08.588,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, a couple of interesting things about Nones are:

63
0:03:11.081,000 --> 0:03:12,000
there are a lot of us,

64
0:03:12.287,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and we skew young.

65
0:03:14.948,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In 2014, there were over 56 million religiously unaffiliated Nones

66
0:03:21.31,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in the United States.

67
0:03:23.029,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And Nones account for over one-third of adults

68
0:03:27.189,000 --> 0:03:29,000
between the ages of 18 to 33.

69
0:03:30.489,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But the most interesting thing to me about Nones

70
0:03:33.466,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is that we're often spiritual.

71
0:03:35.792,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, 68 percent of us believe, with some degree of certainty,

72
0:03:40.036,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that there is a God.

73
0:03:41.44,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We're just not sure who it is.

74
0:03:42.977,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:45.861,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So the first takeaway for me

76
0:03:47.85,000 --> 0:03:51,000
when I realized I was a None and had found that information out

77
0:03:51.935,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was that I wasn't alone.

78
0:03:54.139,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I was finally part of a group in America

79
0:03:56.203,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that had a lot of members,

80
0:03:57.705,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which felt really reassuring.

81
0:03:59.731,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But then the second, not-so-reassuring takeaway

82
0:04:02.446,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.

83
0:04:04.701,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That can't be good,

84
0:04:05.947,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because if a lot of highly spiritual people are currently godless,

85
0:04:09.824,000 --> 0:04:12,000
maybe finding God is not going to be as easy as I had originally hoped.

86
0:04:13.583,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So that is when I decided that on my spiritual journey,

87
0:04:16.931,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I was going to avoid the obvious places

88
0:04:19.029,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and skip the big-box religions altogether

89
0:04:21.549,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and instead venture out into the spiritual fringe

90
0:04:25.231,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of mediums

91
0:04:26.564,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and faith healers

92
0:04:28.381,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and godmen.

93
0:04:30.336,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist,

94
0:04:32.398,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which means I was pretty inclined to keep a fairly open mind,

95
0:04:36.341,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which turned out to be a good thing,

96
0:04:38.453,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because I went to a witch's potluck dinner

97
0:04:42.191,000 --> 0:04:44,000
at the LGBT Center in New York City,

98
0:04:45.127,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where I befriended two witches;

99
0:04:47.814,000 --> 0:04:5,000
drank a five-gallon jerrican full of volcanic water

100
0:04:51.579,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with a shaman in Peru;

101
0:04:54.173,000 --> 0:04:56,000
got a hug from a saint in the convention center --

102
0:04:56.617,000 --> 0:04:57,000
she smelled really nice --

103
0:04:57.986,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:59.739,000 --> 0:05:02,000
chanted for hours in a smoke-filled, heat-infused sweat lodge

105
0:05:03.51,000 --> 0:05:04,000
on the beaches of Mexico;

106
0:05:05.958,000 --> 0:05:08,000
worked with a tequila-drinking medium to convene with the dead,

107
0:05:09.27,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who oddly included both my deceased mother-in-law

108
0:05:12.652,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the deceased manager of the hip-hop group The Roots.

109
0:05:15.852,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:16.959,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Yeah, my mother-in-law told me she was really happy

111
0:05:19.726,000 --> 0:05:21,000
her son had chosen me for his wife.

112
0:05:21.756,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Duh! But --

113
0:05:22.931,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:24.894,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Yeah.

115
0:05:26.076,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But the manager of The Roots

116
0:05:28.189,000 --> 0:05:31,000
said that maybe I should cut back on all the pasta I was eating.

117
0:05:31.529,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I think we can all agree

118
0:05:33.161,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that it was lucky for my husband that it wasn't his dead mother

119
0:05:36.223,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who suggested I lay off carbs.

120
0:05:37.73,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:38.848,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I also joined a laughing yoga group out of South Africa;

122
0:05:43.917,000 --> 0:05:46,000
witnessed a woman have a 45-minute orgasm --

123
0:05:47.612,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I am not making this up --

124
0:05:48.959,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as she tapped into the energy of the universe --

125
0:05:51.545,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I think I'm going to go back there --

126
0:05:53.844,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:57.35,000 --> 0:06:01,000
called God from a phone booth in the Nevada desert at Burning Man,

128
0:06:01.43,000 --> 0:06:03,000
wearing a unitard and ski goggles;

129
0:06:04.556,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and I had an old Indian guy lie on top of me,

130
0:06:08.088,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and no, he wasn't my husband.

131
0:06:10.122,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This was a perfect stranger named Paramji,

132
0:06:12.559,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and he was chanting into my chakras

133
0:06:14.346,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as he tapped into the energy forces of the Universe to heal my "yoni,"

134
0:06:19.048,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is a Sanskrit word for "vagina."

135
0:06:22.063,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:23.411,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I was going to have a slide here,

137
0:06:25.007,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but a few people suggested

138
0:06:26.862,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that a slide of my yoni at TED -- even TEDWomen --

139
0:06:31.201,000 --> 0:06:32,000
not the best idea.

140
0:06:32.584,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:34.927,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Very early in my quest,

142
0:06:36.615,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I also went to see the Brazilian faith healer John of God

143
0:06:39.975,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at his compound down in Brazil.

144
0:06:42.166,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, John of God is considered a full-trance medium,

145
0:06:45.239,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which basically means he can talk to dead people.

146
0:06:48.173,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But in his case, he claims to channel a very specific group

147
0:06:51.962,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of dead saints and doctors

148
0:06:53.424,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in order to heal whatever's wrong with you.

149
0:06:55.827,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And although John of God does not have a medical degree

150
0:06:58.799,000 --> 0:07:,000
or even a high school diploma,

151
0:07:01.653,000 --> 0:07:02,000
he actually performs surgery --

152
0:07:04.186,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the real kind, with a scalpel,

153
0:07:06.504,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but no anesthesia.

154
0:07:08.893,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Yeah, I don't know.

155
0:07:10.077,000 --> 0:07:13,000
He also offers invisible surgery, where there is no cutting,

156
0:07:13.571,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and surrogate surgery,

157
0:07:14.752,000 --> 0:07:18,000
where he supposedly can treat somebody who is thousands of miles away

158
0:07:18.874,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by performing a procedure on a loved one.

159
0:07:21.747,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, when you go to visit John of God,

160
0:07:23.614,000 --> 0:07:25,000
there are all kinds of rules and regulations.

161
0:07:25.774,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's a whole complicated thing,

162
0:07:27.38,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but the bottom line is that you can visit John of God

163
0:07:30.663,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and present him with three things that you would like fixed,

164
0:07:33.894,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and he will set the dead saints and doctors to work on your behalf

165
0:07:37.015,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to get the job done.

166
0:07:38.222,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:39.255,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, before you snicker,

168
0:07:41.754,000 --> 0:07:42,000
consider

169
0:07:43.262,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that, at least according to his website,

170
0:07:45.258,000 --> 0:07:46,000
over eight million people --

171
0:07:47.802,000 --> 0:07:48,000
including Oprah,

172
0:07:49.63,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the Goddess of Daytime TV --

173
0:07:52.441,000 --> 0:07:53,000
have gone to see John of God,

174
0:07:54.328,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and I was pre-wired to keep an open mind.

175
0:07:58.124,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But to be honest, the whole thing for me was kind of weird and inconclusive,

176
0:08:01.766,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and in the end, I flew home,

177
0:08:03.541,000 --> 0:08:05,000
even more confused than I already started out.

178
0:08:06.913,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But that doesn't mean I came home empty-handed.

179
0:08:10.605,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In the weeks leading up to my trip to Brazil,

180
0:08:13.182,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I mentioned my upcoming plans to some friends

181
0:08:15.975,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and to a couple of colleagues at Google,

182
0:08:17.945,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where I was a lawyer at the time.

183
0:08:20.028,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I might have mentioned it to a couple more people

184
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because I'm chatty,

185
0:08:23.775,000 --> 0:08:24,000
including my neighbor,

186
0:08:25.672,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the guy who works at the local coffee shop I go to each morning,

187
0:08:29.181,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the checkout lady at Whole Foods

188
0:08:31.486,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and a stranger who sat next to me on the subway.

189
0:08:34.743,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I told each of them where I was going

190
0:08:36.983,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and why,

191
0:08:38.178,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I offered to carry three wishes of theirs down to Brazil,

192
0:08:42.623,000 --> 0:08:44,000
explaining that anyone going to see John of God

193
0:08:45.416,000 --> 0:08:46,000
could act as a proxy for others

194
0:08:47.25,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and save them the trip.

195
0:08:49.795,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed.

196
0:08:53.906,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Friends told friends who told friends,

197
0:08:55.831,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and those friends apparently told more friends,

198
0:08:58.091,000 --> 0:09:,000
other strangers and the guys at their coffee shops,

199
0:09:00.525,000 --> 0:09:02,000
until it seemed that days before I left for Brazil

200
0:09:02.953,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that there was no one who did not have my email address.

201
0:09:06.765,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And at the time, all I could conclude was that I had offered too much

202
0:09:11.139,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to too many.

203
0:09:13.302,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But when I actually reread those messages a few years later,

204
0:09:18.172,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I noticed something completely different.

205
0:09:22.728,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Those emails actually shared three commonalities,

206
0:09:26.885,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the first of which was rather curious.

207
0:09:29.791,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Almost everyone sent me meticulous details about how they could be reached.

208
0:09:35.239,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I had told them, or their friends had told them,

209
0:09:38.159,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that along with the list of the three things they wanted fixed,

210
0:09:41.316,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I needed their photo, their name and their date of birth.

211
0:09:45.533,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But they gave me full addresses, with, like, apartment numbers and zip codes,

212
0:09:49.689,000 --> 0:09:51,000
as if John of God was going to stop by their house

213
0:09:52.068,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and see them in person or send along a package.

214
0:09:55.25,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It was as if, in the highly unlikely event that their wishes were granted

215
0:09:59.631,000 --> 0:10:,000
by John of God,

216
0:10:00.847,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they just wanted to make sure that they weren't delivered

217
0:10:03.644,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to the wrong person or the wrong address.

218
0:10:05.638,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Even if they didn't believe,

219
0:10:07.828,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they were hedging their bets.

220
0:10:10.785,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The second commonality was just as curious,

221
0:10:14.612,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but far more humbling.

222
0:10:17.784,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Virtually everyone --

223
0:10:19.925,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the stranger on the subway,

224
0:10:21.827,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the guy at the coffee shop,

225
0:10:23.53,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the lawyer down the hall,

226
0:10:25.31,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the Jew, the atheist, the Muslim, the devout Catholic --

227
0:10:28.873,000 --> 0:10:31,000
all asked for essentially the same three things.

228
0:10:33.02,000 --> 0:10:36,000
OK, there were a couple of outliers, and yes, a few people asked for cash.

229
0:10:36.711,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But when I eliminated what were ultimately a handful of anomalies,

230
0:10:41.527,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the similarities were staggering.

231
0:10:45.931,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Almost every single person

232
0:10:48.828,000 --> 0:10:51,000
first asked for good health for themselves and their families.

233
0:10:54.001,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Almost universally,

234
0:10:56.212,000 --> 0:10:57,000
they next asked for happiness

235
0:10:58.829,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then love,

236
0:11:01.439,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in that order:

237
0:11:03.824,000 --> 0:11:04,000
health, happiness, love.

238
0:11:07.585,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Sometimes they asked for a specific health issue to be fixed,

239
0:11:10.536,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but more often than not, they just asked for good health in general.

240
0:11:15.222,000 --> 0:11:16,000
When it came to happiness,

241
0:11:17.031,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they each phrased it slightly differently,

242
0:11:20.052,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but they all asked for the same specific subtype of happiness, too --

243
0:11:26.282,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the kind of happiness that sinks in

244
0:11:28.832,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and sets down roots in your soul;

245
0:11:32.521,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the kind of happiness that could sustain us,

246
0:11:35.922,000 --> 0:11:37,000
even if we were to lose absolutely everything else.

247
0:11:40.587,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And for love,

248
0:11:42.779,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they all asked for the kind of romantic love,

249
0:11:45.021,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the soul mate that we read about in epic romantic novels,

250
0:11:50.396,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the kind of love that will stay with us till the end of our days.

251
0:11:55.893,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Sorry, that's my husband.

252
0:12:00.665,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Crap! Now I forgot my place.

253
0:12:02.274,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:05.176,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:14.602,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So by and large,

256
0:12:16.185,000 --> 0:12:18,000
all of these friends and strangers,

257
0:12:18.597,000 --> 0:12:21,000
regardless of their background, race or religion,

258
0:12:22.762,000 --> 0:12:23,000
all asked for the same things,

259
0:12:24.45,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and they were the same things that I really wanted,

260
0:12:27.236,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the simplified version of the basic human needs

261
0:12:30.062,000 --> 0:12:34,000
identified by social scientists like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef.

262
0:12:35.668,000 --> 0:12:38,000
No one asked for answers to the big existential questions

263
0:12:38.81,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or for proof of God or the meaning of life like I had set out to find.

264
0:12:42.596,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They didn't even ask for an end to war or global hunger.

265
0:12:46.879,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Even when they could have asked for absolutely anything,

266
0:12:50.506,000 --> 0:12:53,000
they all asked for health, happiness and love.

267
0:12:55.418,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So now those emails had a third commonality as well.

268
0:12:59.444,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Each of them ended in the exact same way.

269
0:13:03.597,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Instead of thanking me for carting their wishes all the way to Brazil,

270
0:13:08.427,000 --> 0:13:09,000
everyone said,

271
0:13:11.285,000 --> 0:13:12,000
"Please don't tell anyone."

272
0:13:14.738,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So I decided to tell everyone --

273
0:13:16.978,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:18.233,000 --> 0:13:19,000
right here on this stage,

275
0:13:21.421,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not because I'm untrustworthy,

276
0:13:23.867,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but because the fact that we have so much in common

277
0:13:27.133,000 --> 0:13:3,000
feels especially important for us all to hear, especially now,

278
0:13:30.643,000 --> 0:13:32,000
when so many of the world's problems

279
0:13:32.714,000 --> 0:13:35,000
seem to be because we keep focusing on the things that make us different,

280
0:13:36.725,000 --> 0:13:37,000
not on what binds us together.

281
0:13:39.765,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And look -- I am the first to admit that I am not a statistician,

282
0:13:44.79,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and that the data I presented to you that I just accumulated in my in-box

283
0:13:48.734,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is more anecdotal than scientific, more qualitative than quantitative.

284
0:13:54.394,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It is, as anyone who works with data would tell you,

285
0:13:57.64,000 --> 0:14:,000
hardly a statistically significant or demographically balanced sample.

286
0:14:01.488,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But nonetheless, I find myself thinking about those emails

287
0:14:05.573,000 --> 0:14:08,000
every time I reflect back on the bias and prejudice

288
0:14:09.149,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that I've faced in my life,

289
0:14:11.131,000 --> 0:14:13,000
or when there's another hate crime or a senseless tragedy

290
0:14:14.049,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that underscores the disheartening sense

291
0:14:16.685,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that our differences might be insurmountable.

292
0:14:21.07,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I then remind myself that I have evidence

293
0:14:23.404,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that the humbling, unifying commonality

294
0:14:26.01,000 --> 0:14:27,000
of our humanity

295
0:14:27.644,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is that, even when presented with the opportunity

296
0:14:30.636,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to ask for anything at all,

297
0:14:32.813,000 --> 0:14:33,000
most of us want the same things,

298
0:14:34.774,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and that this is true no matter who we are,

299
0:14:38.179,000 --> 0:14:39,000
what name we call our god,

300
0:14:40.702,000 --> 0:14:43,000
or which religion, if any, we call home.

301
0:14:45.3,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I then also note

302
0:14:46.928,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that apparently some of us want these things so badly

303
0:14:50.821,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that we would email a None,

304
0:14:53.319,000 --> 0:14:56,000
a spiritually confused None like me --

305
0:14:56.63,000 --> 0:14:58,000
some might say otherwise confused as well --

306
0:14:59.742,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and that we would seek out this stranger and email her our deepest wishes,

307
0:15:04.547,000 --> 0:15:07,000
just in case there is the remote possibility

308
0:15:07.916,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that they might be granted by someone who is not a god,

309
0:15:11.581,000 --> 0:15:13,000
much less our god,

310
0:15:13.994,000 --> 0:15:15,000
someone who is not even a member of our chosen religion,

311
0:15:17.998,000 --> 0:15:19,000
someone who, when you look at him on paper,

312
0:15:20.023,000 --> 0:15:22,000
seems like an unlikely candidate to deliver.

313
0:15:24.354,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And so now,

314
0:15:26.494,000 --> 0:15:29,000
when I reflect back on my spiritual quest,

315
0:15:31.758,000 --> 0:15:33,000
even though I did not find God,

316
0:15:35.211,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I found a home in this:

317
0:15:39.17,000 --> 0:15:43,000
even today, in a world fractured by religious,

318
0:15:44.069,000 --> 0:15:49,000
ethnic, political, philosophical, and racial divides,

319
0:15:49.23,000 --> 0:15:52,000
even with all of our obvious differences,

320
0:15:52.288,000 --> 0:15:53,000
at the end of the day,

321
0:15:54.311,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and the most fundamental level,

322
0:15:56.886,000 --> 0:15:57,000
we are all the same.

323
0:15:59.613,000 --> 0:16:,000
Thank you.

324
0:16:00.8,000 --> 0:16:05,000

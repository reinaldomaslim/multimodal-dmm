1
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
If you're at all like me,

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
capable of more than 30 knots.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and it can do amazing things.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And one day, a vessel not unlike this

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
will probably break the world speed record.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But kites aren't just toys like this.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and tell you about the magnificent future

12
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of every child's favorite plaything.

13
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So, kites are more than a thousand years old,

14
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the Chinese used them for military applications,

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and even for lifting men.

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock

20
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
all of the great inventors of the time --

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
like Hargreaves, like Langley,

25
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --

26
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Then these two fellows came along,

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and they were flying kites to develop the control systems

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that would ultimately enable powered human flight.

30
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the Wright Flyer.

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And their experiments with kites led to this

33
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the

34
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
first-ever 12-second human flight.

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.

36
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.

37
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.

38
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd

39
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,

40
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored

41
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in the Journal of Energy

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to generate enormous amounts of electricity.

44
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The real key observation he made is that

45
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power

46
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,

48
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but they can't really go a lot higher,

49
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --

50
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as much as twice as much.

51
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,

52
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,

53
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,

54
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.

55
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,

56
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,

57
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.

58
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:

59
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.

60
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,

61
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
where we don't have a technology as yet to get there.

62
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites.

63
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.

64
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'm now going to show you

65
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the first autonomous generation of power

66
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
by every child's favorite plaything.

67
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.

68
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It makes you a little nauseous.

69
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --

70
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so, enough to power probably five United States households --

71
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with a kite not much larger than this piano.

72
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And the real significant thing here

73
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is we're developing the control systems,

74
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.

75
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.

76
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow --

77
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that's tracing your name in the sky.

78
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this is where we're actually going.

79
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So we're beyond the 12-second steps.

80
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines

81
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.

82
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So you ask, how big are those machines?

83
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!

84
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That would be enough to power your cell phone.

85
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.

86
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.

87
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,

88
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which is more than the largest wind turbines today.

89
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.

90
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So that is audacious, you say. I agree.

91
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.

92
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is a refrigerator factory,

93
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
churning out airplanes for World War II.

94
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.

95
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
By 1945, they were making 100,000.

96
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,

97
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.

98
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people

99
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with these dreams. There are many of us.

100
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.

101
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I think we need to support all of the dreams

102
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of the kids out there doing these crazy things.

103
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thank you.

104
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Video) Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Announcer Four: Vicious cartels. Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Announcer Six: Societal decay. Announcer Seven: 65 dead.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Announcer Eight: Tsunami warning. Announcer Nine: Cyberattacks.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Multiple Announcers: Drug war. Mass destruction. Tornado.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Crisis. Death. Disaster.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Oh, my God.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I collected over the last six months --

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
could have easily been the last six days

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or the last six years.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The point is that the news media

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
preferentially feeds us negative stories

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because that's what our minds pay attention to.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And there's a very good reason for that.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Every second of every day,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
our senses bring in way too much data

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
than we can possibly process in our brains.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And because nothing is more important to us

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
than survival,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the first stop of all of that data

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
called the amygdala.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
our danger detector.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It sorts and scours through all of the information

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So given a dozen news stories,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we will preferentially look

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at the negative news.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And that old newspaper saying,

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"If it bleeds it leads,"

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is very true.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So given all of our digital devices

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that are bringing all the negative news to us

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
seven days a week, 24 hours a day,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's no wonder that people think

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that the world is getting worse.

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But perhaps that's not the case.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Perhaps instead,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
it's the distortions brought to us

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of what's really going on.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
over the last century

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
by a series of forces

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
are, in fact, accelerating to a point

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that we have the potential in the next three decades

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to create a world of abundance.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now I'm not saying

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we don't have our set of problems --

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
climate crisis, species extinction,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
water and energy shortage -- we surely do.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And as humans, we are far better

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
at seeing the problems way in advance,

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but ultimately we knock them down.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So let's look

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
at what this last century has been

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to see where we're going.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Over the last hundred years,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the average human lifespan has more than doubled,

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
average per capita income adjusted for inflation

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
around the world has tripled.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Childhood mortality

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
has come down a factor of 10.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Add to that the cost of food, electricity,

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
transportation, communication

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Steve Pinker has showed us

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in human history.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And Charles Kenny

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in the last 130 years.

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And many people forget this.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Think of this, in America today,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the majority of people under the poverty line

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
television, mobile phones,

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
air conditioning and cars.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
could have never dreamed of such luxuries.

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Underpinning much of this

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is technology,

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and of late,

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
exponentially growing technologies.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
My good friend Ray Kurzweil

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
showed that any tool that becomes an information technology

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and experiences price performance doubling

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
every 12 to 24 months.

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That's why the cellphone in your pocket

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
than a supercomputer of the '70s.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now look at this curve.

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I want you to notice two things from this curve.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Number one, how smooth it is --

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
recession, depression and boom time.

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is the result of faster computers

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
being used to build faster computers.

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And also, even though it's plotted

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on a log curve on the left,

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it's curving upwards.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The rate at which the technology is getting faster

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is itself getting faster.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,

116
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
available to all of us.

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Cloud computing,

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
sensors and networks; robotics;

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
personalized production around the planet;

123
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
synthetic biology;

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
fuels, vaccines and foods;

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
by IBM's Watson?

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I mean, that was epic.

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In fact, I scoured the headlines

130
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Jeopardy's not an easy game.

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's about the nuance of human language.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And imagine if you would

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
A.I.'s like this on the cloud

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
available to every person with a cellphone.

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Four years ago here at TED,

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
called Singularity University.

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we teach our students all of these technologies,

141
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and particularly how they can be used

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to solve humanity's grand challenges.

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And every year we ask them

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to start a company or a product or a service

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that can affect positively the lives of a billion people

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
within a decade.

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
can touch the lives of a billion people today.

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Today we can point at dozens of companies

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that have done just that.

152
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
When I think about creating abundance,

153
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;

154
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it's about creating a life of possibility.

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It is about taking that which was scarce

156
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and making it abundant.

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You see, scarcity is contextual,

158
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and technology is a resource-liberating force.

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Let me give you an example.

160
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So this is a story of Napoleon III

161
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in the mid-1800s.

162
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
He's the dude on the left.

163
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He invited over to dinner

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the king of Siam.

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
All of Napoleon's troops

166
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
were fed with silver utensils,

167
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Napoleon himself with gold utensils.

168
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But the King of Siam,

169
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
he was fed with aluminum utensils.

170
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You see, aluminum

171
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
was the most valuable metal on the planet,

172
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
worth more than gold and platinum.

173
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument

174
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is made of aluminum.

175
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You see, even though aluminum

176
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,

177
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it doesn't come as a pure metal.

178
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.

179
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But then the technology of electrolysis came along

180
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and literally made aluminum so cheap

181
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that we use it with throw-away mentality.

182
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So let's project this analogy going forward.

183
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We think about energy scarcity.

184
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

185
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we are on a planet

186
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy

187
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
than we use in a year.

188
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface

189
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
every 88 minutes.

190
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's not about being scarce,

191
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it's about accessibility.

192
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And there's good news here.

193
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
For the first time, this year

194
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the cost of solar-generated electricity

195
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India --

196
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.

197
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.

198
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Last month, MIT put out a study

199
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
showing that by the end of this decade,

200
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in the sunny parts of the United States,

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour

202
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
compared to 15 cents

203
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
as a national average.

204
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And if we have abundant energy,

205
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we also have abundant water.

206
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now we talk about water wars.

207
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Do you remember

208
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft

209
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
back towards the Earth,

210
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?

211
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He took a famous photo. What was it called?

212
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"A Pale Blue Dot."

213
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Because we live on a water planet.

214
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.

215
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,

216
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
two percent is ice,

217
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,

218
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but here too there is hope.

219
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And there is technology coming online,

220
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
not 10, 20 years from now,

221
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
right now.

222
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.

223
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,

224
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
one of the great DIY innovators,

225
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so --

226
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
his technology called Slingshot

227
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that many of you may have heard of,

228
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.

229
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's able to generate

230
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day

231
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine --

232
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
at less than two cents a liter.

233
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed

234
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to do a major test

235
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.

236
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And if that pans out,

237
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which I have every confidence it will,

238
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Coca-Cola will deploy this globally

239
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to 206 countries

240
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
around the planet.

241
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,

242
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that exists today.

243
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And we've seen this in cellphones.

244
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration

245
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of cellphones in the developing world

246
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
by the end of 2013.

247
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Think about it,

248
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya

249
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
has better mobile comm

250
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
than President Reagan did 25 years ago.

251
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And if they're on a smartphone on Google,

252
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they've got access to more knowledge and information

253
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
than President Clinton did 15 years ago.

254
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance

255
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that no one could have ever predicted.

256
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Better than that,

257
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the things that you and I

258
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for --

259
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
GPS, HD video and still images,

260
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
libraries of books and music,

261
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
medical diagnostic technology --

262
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing

263
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
into your cellphone.

264
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Probably the best part of it

265
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is what's coming down the pike in health.

266
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation

267
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.

268
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We're challenging teams around the world

269
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to basically combine these technologies

270
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
into a mobile device

271
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,

272
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.

273
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better

274
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
than a team of board-certified doctors.

275
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So literally, imagine this device

276
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,

277
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
25 percent of the disease burden

278
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.

279
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus

280
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that it doesn't recognize,

281
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it calls the CDC

282
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.

283
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But here, here is the biggest force

284
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for bringing about a world of abundance.

285
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I call it the rising billion.

286
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So the white lines here are population.

287
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.

288
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And by the way,

289
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the biggest protection against a population explosion

290
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is making the world educated

291
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and healthy.

292
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In 2010,

293
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we had just short of two billion people

294
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
online, connected.

295
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
By 2020,

296
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that's going from two billion to five billion

297
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Internet users.

298
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Three billion new minds

299
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
who have never been heard from before

300
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
are connecting to the global conversation.

301
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
What will these people want?

302
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
What will they consume? What will they desire?

303
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And rather than having economic shutdown,

304
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
These people represent

306
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
tens of trillions of dollars

307
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
injected into the global economy.

308
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And they will get healthier

309
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
by using the Tricorder,

310
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,

311
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and by literally being able to use

312
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
3D printing and infinite computing

313
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
[become] more productive than ever before.

314
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So what could three billion rising,

315
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
healthy, educated, productive members of humanity

316
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
bring to us?

317
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.

318
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
What about giving the oppressed,

319
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
wherever they might be,

320
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the voice to be heard and the voice to act

321
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
for the first time ever?

322
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
What will these three billion people bring?

323
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What about contributions we can't even predict?

324
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize

325
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is that small teams

326
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
driven by their passion with a clear focus

327
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
can do extraordinary things,

328
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
things that large corporations and governments

329
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
could only do in the past.

330
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Let me share and close with a story

331
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that really got me excited.

332
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.

333
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It's a game called Foldit.

334
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.

335
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And this is a game

336
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids

337
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and figure out how the protein is going to fold.

338
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.

339
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And it's very important for research in medicine.

340
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.

341
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And this game has been played

342
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
by university professors and so forth.

343
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people

344
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
came online and started playing it.

345
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And it showed that, in fact, today,

346
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the human pattern recognition machinery

347
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is better at folding proteins than the best computers.

348
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And when these individuals went and looked

349
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
at who was the best protein folder in the world,

350
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
it wasn't an MIT professor,

351
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
it wasn't a CalTech student,

352
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
it was a person from England, from Manchester,

353
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
a woman who, during the day,

354
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic

355
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.

356
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

357
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
what gives me tremendous confidence

358
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in the future

359
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals

360
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to take on the grand challenges of this planet.

361
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We have the tools with this exponential technology.

362
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.

363
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.

364
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And we have three billion new minds

365
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
coming online to work with us

366
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
to solve the grand challenges,

367
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to do that which we must do.

368
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.

369
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Thank you.

370
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Applause)

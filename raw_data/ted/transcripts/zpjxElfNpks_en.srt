1
0:00:13.325,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today, what I want to share with you is something that happened to me,

2
0:00:17.063,000 --> 0:00:19,000
actually, around four weeks ago, it happened.

3
0:00:19.912,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Words were said to me that I never thought I would ever hear it said to my face

4
0:00:26.251,000 --> 0:00:27,000
by another human being.

5
0:00:28.609,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And those words, they shattered my heart.

6
0:00:33.578,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And at the same time, they filled it with so much hope.

7
0:00:38.387,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the whole experience renewed my commitment

8
0:00:43.173,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to the idea that I came to share with you today.

9
0:00:45.768,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You see, I tell everyone that I am a haunted person.

10
0:00:51.871,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What haunts me is the impossible stories,

11
0:00:56.077,000 --> 0:00:59,000
story after story after story after story

12
0:00:59.188,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of young people, my people, people like me

13
0:01:04.752,000 --> 0:01:08,000
dying out there on the ocean, right now, laying at the bottom of the ocean,

14
0:01:09.268,000 --> 0:01:1,000
serving as fish food.

15
0:01:13.411,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Do you really think that's the best we can do?

16
0:01:15.68,000 --> 0:01:16,000
To serve as fish food?

17
0:01:18.077,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And for those of them who are trying to migrate to Europe --

18
0:01:20.927,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because that's what it is all about,

19
0:01:22.673,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they are trying to migrate to Europe to find a job.

20
0:01:25.086,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Going through Libya.

21
0:01:27.498,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Do you know what happens to us when we're trying to cross through Libya

22
0:01:30.888,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we're trapped over there?

23
0:01:32.45,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Well, we're being sold as slaves.

24
0:01:36.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For 300 dollars, maybe sometimes 500 dollars.

25
0:01:43.474,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Sometimes I hear stories of bodies that fall off an airplane.

26
0:01:48.133,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Somebody hid in the landing gear of a plane

27
0:01:51.03,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or in the cargo section of a plane,

28
0:01:52.736,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and then you find them frozen to death.

29
0:01:56.346,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Wouldn't you be haunted if, like me, from the moment you were a little girl,

30
0:02:00.016,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you hear these stories and they keep repeating themselves,

31
0:02:02.803,000 --> 0:02:03,000
over and over and over?

32
0:02:04.002,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Wouldn't you be haunted?

33
0:02:05.988,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That's my case.

34
0:02:07.917,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And at the same time, you know, as my people are dying,

35
0:02:10.564,000 --> 0:02:11,000
my culture is also dying.

36
0:02:11.835,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There, I said it.

37
0:02:13.026,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Because, you know, we have this culture inferiority,

38
0:02:15.489,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which means that anything that comes from us is not good enough.

39
0:02:18.799,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But you know, in my situation,

40
0:02:20.268,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and because I was raised to criticize by creating, it's Michelangelos.

41
0:02:25.561,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My father said, "Do not come to me with problems

42
0:02:27.911,000 --> 0:02:29,000
unless you thought of a couple alternatives.

43
0:02:29.992,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They don't have to be right,

44
0:02:31.379,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but I just want to know that you thought of something."

45
0:02:33.982,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, I have this attitude in life -- something is wrong, find a way to fix it.

46
0:02:37.728,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And that's why I start the businesses that I start,

47
0:02:40.165,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that's usually consumer brands,

48
0:02:41.697,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that have embedded in them the very best of my African culture.

49
0:02:44.674,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And what I do is it's all packaged, 21st century, world-class tendered,

50
0:02:49.625,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I bring that to one of the most sophisticated markets in the world,

51
0:02:54.516,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which is the US.

52
0:02:56.984,000 --> 0:02:57,000
First company was a beverage company,

53
0:02:58.825,000 --> 0:03:01,000
second one is a skin care company, third one is launching next month,

54
0:03:02.45,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they all have that in common.

55
0:03:05.823,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, why are these people leaving?

56
0:03:09.371,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They're leaving because they have no jobs.

57
0:03:13.093,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They're leaving because where they are, there's no jobs.

58
0:03:15.855,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So ...

59
0:03:18.053,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But poverty, that's really striking them, is the root cause of why they're leaving.

60
0:03:24.977,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, why are people poor?

61
0:03:27.024,000 --> 0:03:29,000
People are poor because they have no money.

62
0:03:29.097,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You have no money because you have no source of income.

63
0:03:31.747,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And for most of us, what is a source of income?

64
0:03:33.998,000 --> 0:03:36,000
For most of us, what is our source of income, what is it, tell me?

65
0:03:37.18,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Jobs, thank you.

66
0:03:38.355,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Where do jobs come from?

67
0:03:41.069,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Come from where?

68
0:03:43.627,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Businesses, thank you.

69
0:03:46.143,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, if jobs is what fixes poverty,

70
0:03:50.159,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and jobs come from businesses,

71
0:03:52.577,000 --> 0:03:53,000
don't you think --

72
0:03:53.975,000 --> 0:03:56,000
especially, they come from small and medium size enterprises, SMEs --

73
0:03:57.319,000 --> 0:03:58,000
then don't you think, maybe for a second,

74
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that we should focus on making it easy for a small-business person

75
0:04:04.277,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to start and run their business?

76
0:04:05.856,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Don't you think that it makes sense?

77
0:04:07.634,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Why is it that when I look at the Doing Business index ranking

78
0:04:10.65,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of the World Bank,

79
0:04:11.832,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that ranks every country in the world

80
0:04:14.545,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in terms of how easy or hard it is to start a company,

81
0:04:17.173,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you tell me why African countries,

82
0:04:20.133,000 --> 0:04:21,000
all 50 of them,

83
0:04:21.513,000 --> 0:04:23,000
are basically at the bottom of that list?

84
0:04:26.824,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's why we're poor.

85
0:04:28.41,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We're poor because it is literally impossible

86
0:04:31.144,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to do businesses in these countries of ours.

87
0:04:34.196,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But I'm going to tell you exactly what it means on the ground

88
0:04:37.125,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for someone like me.

89
0:04:38.3,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I have a manufacturing facility in Senegal.

90
0:04:40.341,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Did you know that for all my raw material that I can't find in the country,

91
0:04:44.547,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I have to pay a 45 percent tariff on everything that comes in?

92
0:04:48.066,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Forty-five percent tariff.

93
0:04:51.217,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Do you know that, even to look for fine cardboard

94
0:04:53.887,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to ship my finished products to the US,

95
0:04:55.998,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I can't find new, finished cardboard?

96
0:04:58.021,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Impossible.

97
0:04:59.236,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Because the distributors are not going to come here

98
0:05:01.702,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to start their business,

99
0:05:02.966,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because it makes no sense, either.

100
0:05:04.666,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So right now, I have to mobilize 3000 dollars' worth of cardboard

101
0:05:07.785,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in my warehouse, so that I can have cardboard,

102
0:05:09.992,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and they won't arrive for another five weeks.

103
0:05:12.116,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The fact that we are stifled with the most nonsensical laws out there.

104
0:05:17.219,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That's why we can't run businesses.

105
0:05:19.378,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's like swimming through molasses.

106
0:05:21.544,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So, what can you do about that?

107
0:05:26.355,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I told you today that someone said to me words that marked me,

108
0:05:30.046,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because I explained the same thing to my employees in Senegal.

109
0:05:33.569,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And one of them started crying -- her name is Yahara.

110
0:05:36.106,000 --> 0:05:37,000
She started crying.

111
0:05:37.506,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I said, "Why are you crying?"

112
0:05:38.935,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe --

113
0:05:42.484,000 --> 0:05:44,000
always seeing us represented as poor people --

114
0:05:44.674,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.

115
0:05:49.087,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Because, otherwise, how do you explain

116
0:05:51.515,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that we're always in the begging situation?"

117
0:05:54.601,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's what broke my heart.

118
0:05:56.125,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But at the same time that she said that,

119
0:05:58.061,000 --> 0:06:,000
because of how I explained just what I explained to you,

120
0:06:00.768,000 --> 0:06:02,000
she said, "But now, I know that I am not the problem.

121
0:06:03.291,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It is my environment in which I live, that's my problem."

122
0:06:06.076,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I said, "Yes."

123
0:06:08.457,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And that's what gave me hope --

124
0:06:10.057,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that once people get it, they now change their outlook on life.

125
0:06:14.129,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Here, what are some of our solutions, then?

126
0:06:16.186,000 --> 0:06:17,000
If jobs is a solution,

127
0:06:17.661,000 --> 0:06:2,000
don't you think, then, that we should be simplifying

128
0:06:20.827,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the business environment of all of these countries?

129
0:06:23.31,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Don't you think?

130
0:06:24.53,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And along with you,

131
0:06:26.14,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I would like for all of your friends from the other 50 countries

132
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that are on the bottom of that list to do the same thing.

133
0:06:31.934,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You do that, we do the rest of the job.

134
0:06:33.823,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'm doing my part of the game, what are you doing?

135
0:06:36.228,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Applause)

136
0:06:37.411,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What are you doing?

137
0:06:38.696,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:40.864,000 --> 0:06:41,000
What are you doing?

139
0:06:42.156,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Applause)

140
0:06:43.331,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And as for you, everybody here in this room,

141
0:06:45.443,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I leave you with two marching orders.

142
0:06:47.284,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Get in the game,

143
0:06:48.483,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the way you get in it is educate yourself,

144
0:06:50.696,000 --> 0:06:51,000
build awareness around yourself,

145
0:06:52.261,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and then also advocate for e-government solutions.

146
0:06:55.236,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He said, "Oh, corruption, how do we fight corruption?"

147
0:06:58.141,000 --> 0:07:,000
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm here to tell you

148
0:07:00.403,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that yes, you can do it by the stroke of a pen.

149
0:07:02.641,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You do not need anyone to tell you when and how to do that.

150
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It is one thing, actually,

151
0:07:07.225,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that you don't need to wait for anyone to do, so do it.

152
0:07:10.188,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Otherwise, don't come and tell me that you want to fix corruption.

153
0:07:13.49,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You and your other 50 friends from the other 50 countries

154
0:07:16.221,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that are at the bottom of that list.

155
0:07:18.006,000 --> 0:07:2,000
That's how you fight corruption.

156
0:07:20.395,000 --> 0:07:23,000
If you were only charging me 5 percent to get my stuff in the country,

157
0:07:23.745,000 --> 0:07:24,000
my raw material,

158
0:07:24.927,000 --> 0:07:25,000
instead of the 45 percent,

159
0:07:26.236,000 --> 0:07:28,000
do you really think that I would have to go a pay a bribe?

160
0:07:28.998,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That's what breeds corruption.

161
0:07:30.8,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Bad laws, sets of horrible, nonsense laws.

162
0:07:35.276,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Applause) (Cheers)

163
0:07:37.688,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Right?

164
0:07:38.863,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

165
0:07:44.196,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You want to fight corruption?

166
0:07:46.03,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's what you do.

167
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And again, remember, you don't need to wait for anyone.

168
0:07:49.861,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You can do that by yourself.

169
0:07:51.259,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Unless you're telling me that maybe you have no sovereignty,

170
0:07:54.126,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and that's a whole other problem.

171
0:07:55.769,000 --> 0:08:01,000
OK, so, from here on, I have simple words for our "leaders."

172
0:08:03.648,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This can go two ways.

173
0:08:06.092,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It can go the nasty way,

174
0:08:07.766,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because we have hundreds of millions of young people

175
0:08:10.483,000 --> 0:08:12,000
coming to life right now, here,

176
0:08:13.331,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and if they don't have an outlook in life,

177
0:08:16.006,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they are going to go for a revolution.

178
0:08:17.879,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They're going to go for violence.

179
0:08:19.506,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And none of us wants that.

180
0:08:21.094,000 --> 0:08:22,000
None, none of us.

181
0:08:22.807,000 --> 0:08:23,000
That's the one way it can go.

182
0:08:24.244,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Or the second way it can go is,

183
0:08:25.792,000 --> 0:08:28,000
all this happens peacefully, productively, and everything is good,

184
0:08:29.157,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and you do what you need to do, you get out of my way,

185
0:08:31.743,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you let people like me do our job, we create all these jobs we need,

186
0:08:35.014,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and then Africa becomes this very prosperous country

187
0:08:38.744,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that it's designed to be, it should have been for a long time.

188
0:08:41.752,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It happens like that, everybody's happy, we move on with our lives.

189
0:08:44.929,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It can happen in two ways --

190
0:08:46.347,000 --> 0:08:49,000
pick violence or you pick the calm, productive way.

191
0:08:49.522,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I want the calm, productive way.

192
0:08:51.101,000 --> 0:08:53,000
None of us should ever, ever even try to think

193
0:08:53.379,000 --> 0:08:55,000
about what else could happen if we don't go there.

194
0:08:55.77,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So, please.

195
0:08:57.124,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And the time has come.

196
0:08:58.379,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This type of picture -- prosperity, happiness, human flourishing --

197
0:09:02.085,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that's what I see if we do our job.

198
0:09:04.03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Thank you.

199
0:09:05.212,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause) (Cheering)

200
0:09:07.508,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Thank you.

201
0:09:08.706,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

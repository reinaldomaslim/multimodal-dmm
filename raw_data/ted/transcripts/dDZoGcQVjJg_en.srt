1
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Music)

2
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Singing) I was walking down the line,

3
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:46,000
trying to find some peace of mind.

4
0:01:47.92,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Then I saw you.

5
0:01:51.32,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You were takin' it slow and walkin' it one step at a time.

6
0:02:00.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I said, "Listen, stranger,

7
0:02:04.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'm feeling low now.

8
0:02:07.96,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I don't know which way to go."

9
0:02:14.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I said, "If you're lost now,

10
0:02:18.36,000 --> 0:02:21,000
maybe I could help you along and sing you a song,

11
0:02:21.56,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and move you on and on and on."

12
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Singing down the line.

13
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Where shall we go? Where shall we go?

14
0:02:42.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
She said, "I'm looking for a kind of shelter.

15
0:02:46.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
A place for me to call my own.

16
0:02:50.28,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I've been walking all night long,

17
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but I don't know where to call my home."

18
0:02:57.04,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"The only way to find that place

19
0:02:59.48,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is close to where my heart is.

20
0:03:03.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I know I'm gonna get there,

21
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but I've got to keep on walking down the line."

22
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Down the line.

23
0:03:44.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Down the line.

24
0:04:00.72,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Thank you so much.

25
0:04:01.96,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Applause)

26
0:04:08.937,000 --> 0:04:1,000
How's everybody feeling today? You feeling good?

27
0:04:11.2,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Cheers)

28
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Fantastic. Would everybody mind singing with me for just one second?

29
0:04:15.48,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Could you sing something? Could you sing a D?

30
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Sing "Ooh."

31
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Audience hums)

32
0:04:27.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Oh -- louder for me, louder for me.

33
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Singing) Oh.

34
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, please, if you could sing,

35
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"Oh oh oh."

36
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Audience: Oh oh oh.

37
0:04:44.4,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Jacob Collier: Whoa oh oh.

38
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

39
0:04:50.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh."

40
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Audience: Whoa oh.

41
0:04:55.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
JC: Oh oh oh.

42
0:04:58.56,000 --> 0:05:,000
Audience: Oh oh oh.

43
0:05:01.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

44
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

45
0:05:06.92,000 --> 0:05:09,000
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

46
0:05:10.08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

47
0:05:12.92,000 --> 0:05:14,000
JC: Whoa oh oh.

48
0:05:15.68,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

49
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

50
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

51
0:05:28.2,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Thank you so much. That's beautiful. Thank you.

52
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Applause)

53
0:05:32.6,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Thank you.

54
0:05:33.84,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So do you feel that motion?

55
0:05:35.2,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Do you feel yourself as part of that motion,

56
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
things moving underneath the surface?

57
0:05:39.12,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So the language of musical harmony is an absolutely extraordinary one.

58
0:05:42.414,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's a way of navigating one's emotional frameworks,

59
0:05:44.859,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but without the need to put things into words,

60
0:05:47.026,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and I think that, as with many other languages,

61
0:05:49.263,000 --> 0:05:51,000
it doesn't matter how much you know about a language.

62
0:05:51.72,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It doesn't matter how many words you can say,

63
0:05:53.88,000 --> 0:05:54,000
how many phrases you know.

64
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What matters is the emotional choices you make with this language.

65
0:05:58.32,000 --> 0:06:,000
So I encourage us to embrace this idea as a community,

66
0:06:00.868,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which is the thing which in time may grow us towards

67
0:06:03.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
as opposed to away from our own humanity.

68
0:06:05.417,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Thank you so much.

69
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

70
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Music)

71
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Singing) Take me

72
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:38,000
anywhere you want to go.

73
0:06:41.44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You know that my love is strong.

74
0:06:47.96,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In my hideaway.

75
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
Softly,

76
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:08,000
like the calm that follows storms,

77
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Find what I've been searching for all along.

78
0:07:15.32,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In my hideaway.

79
0:07:23.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Even when I close my eyes,

80
0:07:33.68,000 --> 0:07:39,000
darling, if you've gone astray, I'm on my way to my hideaway.

81
0:07:49.12,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Touch me

82
0:07:55.84,000 --> 0:08:,000
like I've never loved before,

83
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in the place that I adore,

84
0:08:08.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in my hideaway.

85
0:08:16.04,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I know

86
0:08:22.12,000 --> 0:08:28,000
whichever way the wind may blow,

87
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
there will be a place for me to go

88
0:08:35.44,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in my hideaway.

89
0:08:41.4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
My hideaway.

90
0:09:42.4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Sticks and stones

91
0:09:46.92,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I won't hide from you no more.

92
0:09:53.08,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And in time

93
0:09:57.4,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I find what I've been searching for.

94
0:10:03.48,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Heard your voice

95
0:10:08.36,000 --> 0:10:09,000
calling out to me.

96
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I'm on my way

97
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to where I can be free.

98
0:10:24.8,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And if she won't wait for me, do it right, don't look back,

99
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
keep my heart on the future.

100
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
On the soles of my shoes all the places I've been

101
0:10:35.6,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that I've known since I knew her.

102
0:10:40.04,000 --> 0:10:42,000
'Cause it's you, don't you know that you're making me guess

103
0:10:42.88,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that you're the one for me.

104
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:49,000
That it's you that I guess that I wanted to know all along.

105
0:10:50.52,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Girl, it's you that I want, that makes me complete,

106
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:55,000
cause you're the one for me.

107
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's thanks to you that I guess that I want you to know I belong.

108
0:11:17.56,000 --> 0:11:19,000
One, two, three, four, five.

109
0:11:59.44,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

110
0:12:03.24,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you so much. Thank you.

111
0:12:05.8,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Applause)

112
0:12:19.08,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

113
0:12:22.36,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Thanks so much. Thank you guys.

114
0:12:34.44,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Kelly Stoetzel: OK, Jacob. Wow.

115
0:12:38.28,000 --> 0:12:4,000
OK, we have some questions. JC: OK.

116
0:12:40.92,000 --> 0:12:41,000
KS: That was spectacular.

117
0:12:42.84,000 --> 0:12:43,000
JC: Thank you, Kelly. Thank you.

118
0:12:44.6,000 --> 0:12:46,000
KS: Those visualizations we just saw,

119
0:12:46.72,000 --> 0:12:47,000
those were happening in real time, yeah?

120
0:12:48.68,000 --> 0:12:5,000
JC: Yeah, so everything visual

121
0:12:51.12,000 --> 0:12:54,000
takes cues from things which are audial, or something, if that's a word,

122
0:12:54.525,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and so everything is real time.

123
0:12:56.04,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I cue the loops, I play the instruments

124
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
and then the tree, for example, that you saw grow,

125
0:13:00.4,000 --> 0:13:02,000
grows in such a way that it takes low long notes

126
0:13:02.92,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and grows thick long branches,

127
0:13:05.36,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and it takes high, quiet notes, whatever, and then it grows thin, small branches.

128
0:13:09.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And then my singing voice

129
0:13:11.6,000 --> 0:13:13,000
sort of blows wind against the tree.

130
0:13:13.76,000 --> 0:13:15,000
KS: So you're 22 years old. JC: Yes, indeed.

131
0:13:16.48,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Moderator: You played all of that by yourself.

132
0:13:19.76,000 --> 0:13:22,000
How did you get started and how did this all evolve?

133
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
JC: I have this magical room in my house

134
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in North London, which is, like, over there.

135
0:13:27.64,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Cheers)

136
0:13:28.68,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you. Represent North London.

137
0:13:30.4,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And this room -- I mean, this is my family home.

138
0:13:33.04,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I grew up in this room filled with musical instruments,

139
0:13:36.48,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but most importantly, I had a family

140
0:13:38.4,000 --> 0:13:4,000
who encouraged me to invest in my own imagination,

141
0:13:40.8,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and so things I created, things I built were good things to be building

142
0:13:44.76,000 --> 0:13:47,000
just because I was making them, and I think that's such an important idea.

143
0:13:48.28,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But this room was my paradise, essentially,

144
0:13:50.36,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and when I came to tour my album, which is called "In My Room,"

145
0:13:53.36,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I thought I'd try and tour the room on the road,

146
0:13:55.64,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and that's quite a strange idea,

147
0:13:57.24,000 --> 0:14:,000
but it's something that I've been working on for a couple of years,

148
0:14:00.44,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and it's quite exciting to be inside the circle.

149
0:14:02.84,000 --> 0:14:05,000
KS: So this is really like the setup in your room, here.

150
0:14:05.88,000 --> 0:14:07,000
JC: It kind of is. It's similar to the room

151
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in the sense that I can generate things on the spot

152
0:14:10.44,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and I can be spontaneous,

153
0:14:11.72,000 --> 0:14:15,000
which is what I think both music and all of the best ideas are all about.

154
0:14:15.92,000 --> 0:14:17,000
KS: So you won two Grammys

155
0:14:18.84,000 --> 0:14:22,000
for a record that you made in your room by yourself.

156
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And how is that even possible? We couldn't have done that,

157
0:14:27.56,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that couldn't have happened five years ago even.

158
0:14:29.84,000 --> 0:14:3,000
JC: It's a brand new world.

159
0:14:31.2,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The power is now in the hands of the creator,

160
0:14:33.44,000 --> 0:14:34,000
as I'm sure you guys would agree,

161
0:14:35.08,000 --> 0:14:37,000
as opposed to the big record company executive

162
0:14:37.28,000 --> 0:14:38,000
or the big man or something like that.

163
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It's somebody with a good idea.

0:14:40.68,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Here I am at TED saying this to you guys who know this already,

165
0:14:43.68,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but it's somebody with a good idea who can sow that seed.

166
0:14:46.4,000 --> 0:14:48,000
That's the person who carries the torch into the world.

167
0:14:49.04,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And yeah, I made this album completely on my own

168
0:14:51.32,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and I didn't wait for somebody to say,

169
0:14:53.2,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"Hey Jacob, you should make an album on your own."

170
0:14:55.6,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I just went ahead and made it and I didn't mind what people thought,

171
0:14:58.815,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and two Grammys is a massive bonus.

172
0:15:00.52,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Applause)

173
0:15:06.32,000 --> 0:15:09,000
KS: Thank you so much, Jacob. JC: Thanks, Kelly. Thanks so much.

174
0:15:09.72,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Applause)

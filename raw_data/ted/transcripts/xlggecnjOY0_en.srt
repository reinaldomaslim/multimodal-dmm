1
0:00:12.197,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I would like to talk to you about a story

2
0:00:14.082,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about a small town kid.

3
0:00:16.563,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.

4
0:00:20.238,000 --> 0:00:23,000
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.

5
0:00:23.314,000 --> 0:00:27,000
His village is near Mogadishu.

6
0:00:27.344,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Drought drives the small village into poverty

7
0:00:29.518,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and to the brink of starvation.

8
0:00:31.386,000 --> 0:00:32,000
With nothing left for him there,

9
0:00:33.222,000 --> 0:00:34,000
he leaves for the big city,

10
0:00:35.049,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.

11
0:00:38.454,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,

12
0:00:41.284,000 --> 0:00:43,000
no jobs, no way forward.

13
0:00:44.272,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He ends up living in a tent city

14
0:00:46.296,000 --> 0:00:48,000
on the outskirts of Mogadishu.

15
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Maybe a year passes, nothing.

16
0:00:53.009,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One day, he's approached by a gentleman

17
0:00:55.309,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who offers to take him to lunch,

18
0:00:57.507,000 --> 0:01:,000
then to dinner, to breakfast.

19
0:01:00.583,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He meets this dynamic group of people,

20
0:01:03.602,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and they give him a break.

21
0:01:05.107,000 --> 0:01:06,000
He's given a bit of money

22
0:01:06.426,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to buy himself some new clothes,

23
0:01:08.528,000 --> 0:01:1,000
money to send back home to his family.

24
0:01:11.064,000 --> 0:01:12,000
He is introduced to this young woman.

25
0:01:13.037,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He eventually gets married.

26
0:01:14.752,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He starts this new life.

27
0:01:17.557,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He has a purpose in life.

28
0:01:20.483,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One beautiful day in Mogadishu,

29
0:01:23.257,000 --> 0:01:25,000
under an azure blue sky,

30
0:01:26.145,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a car bomb goes off.

31
0:01:28.666,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That small town kid with the big city dreams

32
0:01:31.861,000 --> 0:01:33,000
was the suicide bomber,

33
0:01:34.109,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that dynamic group of people

34
0:01:36.467,000 --> 0:01:38,000
were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization

35
0:01:38.836,000 --> 0:01:41,000
linked to al Qaeda.

36
0:01:42.517,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So how does the story of a small town kid

37
0:01:45.389,000 --> 0:01:46,000
just trying to make it big in the city

38
0:01:47.21,000 --> 0:01:49,000
end up with him blowing himself up?

39
0:01:50.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He was waiting.

40
0:01:52.012,000 --> 0:01:53,000
He was waiting for an opportunity,

41
0:01:53.91,000 --> 0:01:54,000
waiting to begin his future,

42
0:01:55.692,000 --> 0:01:57,000
waiting for a way forward,

43
0:01:57.727,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and this was the first thing that came along.

44
0:02:00.106,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This was the first thing that pulled him out

45
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of what we call waithood.

46
0:02:05.46,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And his story repeats itself

47
0:02:07.756,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in urban centers around the world.

48
0:02:10.172,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It is the story of the disenfranchised,

49
0:02:12.926,000 --> 0:02:13,000
unemployed urban youth

50
0:02:14.734,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who sparks riots in Johannesburg,

51
0:02:18.677,000 --> 0:02:2,000
sparks riots in London,

52
0:02:21.011,000 --> 0:02:25,000
who reaches out for something other than waithood.

53
0:02:25.665,000 --> 0:02:27,000
For young people, the promise of the city,

54
0:02:28.329,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the big city dream is that of opportunity,

55
0:02:31.023,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of jobs, of wealth,

56
0:02:33.178,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.

57
0:02:36.919,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.

58
0:02:41.017,000 --> 0:02:44,000
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities

59
0:02:44.21,000 --> 0:02:46,000
will be under the age of 18.

60
0:02:46.77,000 --> 0:02:47,000
If we do not include young people

61
0:02:48.534,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in the growth of our cities,

62
0:02:50.353,000 --> 0:02:52,000
if we do not provide them opportunities,

63
0:02:52.832,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the story of waithood,

64
0:02:54.854,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,

65
0:02:57.767,000 --> 0:03:01,000
will be the story of cities 2.0.

66
0:03:01.942,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,

67
0:03:05.103,000 --> 0:03:08,000
70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.

68
0:03:08.793,000 --> 0:03:1,000
70 percent don't work,

69
0:03:11.171,000 --> 0:03:13,000
don't go to school.

70
0:03:13.198,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They pretty much do nothing.

71
0:03:15.623,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I went back to Mogadishu last month,

72
0:03:19.139,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I went to visit Madina Hospital,

73
0:03:21.149,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the hospital I was born in.

74
0:03:23.197,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I remember standing in front of that

75
0:03:25.222,000 --> 0:03:27,000
bullet-ridden hospital thinking,

76
0:03:28.2,000 --> 0:03:3,000
what if I had never left?

77
0:03:30.233,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What if I had been forced

78
0:03:31.426,000 --> 0:03:33,000
into that same state of waithood?

79
0:03:33.945,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Would I have become a terrorist?

80
0:03:37.956,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I'm not really sure about the answer.

81
0:03:40.847,000 --> 0:03:42,000
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month

82
0:03:43.015,000 --> 0:03:44,000
was actually to host

83
0:03:44.562,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.

84
0:03:47.109,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.

85
0:03:50.105,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions

86
0:03:52.351,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to the biggest challenges facing their city.

87
0:03:55.227,000 --> 0:03:58,000
One of the young men in the room was Aden.

88
0:03:58.629,000 --> 0:04:02,000
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.

89
0:04:03.084,000 --> 0:04:05,000
There were no jobs, no opportunities.

90
0:04:05.273,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I remember him telling me,

91
0:04:06.991,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because he was a college graduate,

92
0:04:09.799,000 --> 0:04:11,000
unemployed, frustrated,

93
0:04:12.549,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab

94
0:04:14.946,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.

95
0:04:17.998,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They sought people like him out.

96
0:04:21.876,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But his story takes a different route.

97
0:04:24.972,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier

98
0:04:26.909,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to getting from point A to point B are the roads.

99
0:04:30.162,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Twenty-three years of civil war

100
0:04:31.945,000 --> 0:04:33,000
have completely destroyed the road system,

101
0:04:34.176,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and a motorbike can be the easiest way

102
0:04:36.185,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to get around.

103
0:04:37.815,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.

104
0:04:41.056,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He started a motorbike company.

105
0:04:43.181,000 --> 0:04:45,000
He began renting out motorbikes

106
0:04:45.472,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.

107
0:04:48.772,000 --> 0:04:5,000
He bought 10 bikes, with the help

108
0:04:50.793,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of family and friends,

109
0:04:52.491,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and his dream is to eventually expand

110
0:04:54.224,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to several hundred within the next three years.

111
0:04:57.205,000 --> 0:04:59,000
How is this story different?

112
0:04:59.773,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What makes his story different?

113
0:05:02.13,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I believe it is his ability to identify

114
0:05:04.96,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and seize a new opportunity.

115
0:05:08.298,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's entrepreneurship,

116
0:05:10.329,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I believe entrepreneurship can be

117
0:05:12.088,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the most powerful tool against waithood.

118
0:05:15.066,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It empowers young people

119
0:05:16.836,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to be the creators of the very economic opportunities

120
0:05:20.216,000 --> 0:05:22,000
they are so desperately seeking.

121
0:05:22.714,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.

122
0:05:26.396,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I want to talk to you about a young man

123
0:05:28.512,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who attended one of my meetings,

124
0:05:30.801,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.

125
0:05:33.685,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He was helping me train some of the young people

126
0:05:35.368,000 --> 0:05:36,000
at the summit in entrepreneurship

127
0:05:36.805,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and how to be innovative

128
0:05:38.427,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.

129
0:05:41.194,000 --> 0:05:43,000
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen

130
0:05:43.691,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in over 22 years,

131
0:05:46.375,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and until recently, until Mohamed came along,

132
0:05:49.639,000 --> 0:05:5,000
if you wanted flowers at your wedding,

133
0:05:51.529,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you used plastic bouquets

134
0:05:52.922,000 --> 0:05:53,000
shipped from abroad.

135
0:05:54.508,000 --> 0:05:55,000
If you asked someone,

136
0:05:56.314,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"

137
0:05:58.589,000 --> 0:06:,000
for many who grew up under civil war,

138
0:06:01.175,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the answer would be, "Never."

139
0:06:03.958,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.

140
0:06:05.906,000 --> 0:06:09,000
He started a landscaping and design floral company.

141
0:06:10.353,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,

142
0:06:13.661,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and started growing tulips and lilies,

143
0:06:15.717,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which he said could survive

144
0:06:17.423,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the harsh Mogadishu climate.

145
0:06:20.134,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,

146
0:06:23.832,000 --> 0:06:24,000
creating gardens at homes

147
0:06:25.765,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and businesses around the city,

148
0:06:28.369,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and he's now working on creating

149
0:06:30.106,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.

150
0:06:33.731,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There's no public park in Mogadishu.

151
0:06:35.83,000 --> 0:06:37,000
He wants to create a space where families,

152
0:06:38.159,000 --> 0:06:39,000
young people, can come together,

153
0:06:39.81,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.

154
0:06:44.448,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And he doesn't grow roses because

155
0:06:46.404,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they use too much water, by the way.

156
0:06:50.528,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So the first step is to inspire young people,

157
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and in that room, Mohamed's presence

158
0:06:57.032,000 --> 0:07:,000
had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.

159
0:07:00.508,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They had never really thought about starting up a business.

160
0:07:03.095,000 --> 0:07:04,000
They've thought about working for an NGO,

161
0:07:04.942,000 --> 0:07:05,000
working for the government,

162
0:07:06.629,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but his story, his innovation,

163
0:07:10.936,000 --> 0:07:11,000
really had a strong impact on them.

164
0:07:12.889,000 --> 0:07:14,000
He forced them to look at their city

165
0:07:15.008,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as a place of opportunity.

166
0:07:16.762,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,

167
0:07:20.51,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that they could be change makers.

168
0:07:22.93,000 --> 0:07:23,000
By the end of the day, they were coming up

169
0:07:24.49,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with innovative solutions

170
0:07:26.041,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.

171
0:07:29.373,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions

172
0:07:31.976,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to local problems.

173
0:07:34.898,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So inspiring young people

174
0:07:37.129,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and creating a culture of entrepreneurship

175
0:07:39.543,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is a really great step,

176
0:07:41.41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but young people need capital

177
0:07:43.099,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to make their ideas a reality.

178
0:07:44.888,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They need expertise and mentorship

179
0:07:47.212,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.

180
0:07:50.612,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Connect young people with the resources they need,

181
0:07:53.099,000 --> 0:07:56,000
provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,

182
0:07:56.564,000 --> 0:08:,000
and you will create catalysts for urban growth.

183
0:08:00.664,000 --> 0:08:02,000
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just

184
0:08:03.588,000 --> 0:08:04,000
starting up a business.

185
0:08:05.144,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's about creating a social impact.

186
0:08:07.525,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.

187
0:08:09.66,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I believe he is selling hope.

188
0:08:12.147,000 --> 0:08:14,000
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,

189
0:08:14.736,000 --> 0:08:16,000
when it's created, will actually transform

190
0:08:16.908,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the way people see their city.

191
0:08:18.98,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Aden hired street kids to help rent out

192
0:08:21.133,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and maintain those bikes for him.

193
0:08:22.995,000 --> 0:08:24,000
He gave them the opportunity to escape

194
0:08:25.053,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the paralysis of waithood.

195
0:08:27.989,000 --> 0:08:29,000
These young entrepreneurs are having

196
0:08:30.019,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a tremendous impact in their cities.

197
0:08:33.553,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So my suggestion is,

198
0:08:36.069,000 --> 0:08:38,000
turn youth into entrepreneurs,

199
0:08:38.585,000 --> 0:08:41,000
incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,

200
0:08:41.808,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks

201
0:08:45.647,000 --> 0:08:48,000
than of car bombs and waithood.

202
0:08:48.74,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you.

203
0:08:51.56,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.056,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For as long as I remember, I've loved mathematics.

2
0:00:18.024,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Actually, it's not 100 percent true.

3
0:00:20.919,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've loved mathematics for all but a two-week period

4
0:00:24.287,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in senior high school.

5
0:00:25.469,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:26.807,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was top of my class,

7
0:00:28.005,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and we were about to start the Extension Maths course.

8
0:00:30.811,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was really excited about this brand new topic coming up,

9
0:00:34.097,000 --> 0:00:35,000
complex numbers.

10
0:00:36.064,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I like complex.

11
0:00:38.112,000 --> 0:00:4,000
My teacher was priming us for the concepts

12
0:00:40.144,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with some questions about square roots.

13
0:00:42.241,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Square of nine -- three;

14
0:00:44.098,000 --> 0:00:46,000
square of 256 -- sixteen.

15
0:00:46.852,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Too easy.

16
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Then she asked the trick question:

17
0:00:50.472,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What about the square root of negative one?

18
0:00:53.809,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Of course, we were all over it --

19
0:00:55.476,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"Come on, Miss!

20
0:00:56.651,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We all know you can't take the square root of a negative."

21
0:00:59.841,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"That's true in the real world," she said.

22
0:01:02.238,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"But in the complex world,

23
0:01:04.101,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the square root of negative one is the imaginary number i."

24
0:01:09.879,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:12.657,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That day,

26
0:01:13.86,000 --> 0:01:16,000
my entire mathematical world came crashing down on me.

27
0:01:16.887,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:18.259,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Imaginary numbers?

29
0:01:19.974,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Seriously?

30
0:01:21.49,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But mathematics is a source of truth,

31
0:01:23.499,000 --> 0:01:24,000
please don't go abstract on me.

32
0:01:25.831,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I would have studied art

33
0:01:27.703,000 --> 0:01:29,000
if I wanted to play with imaginary numbers."

34
0:01:29.998,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:31.665,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"This is Extension Maths, let's get back with our program!"

36
0:01:34.998,000 --> 0:01:35,000
She didn't,

37
0:01:36.18,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and over the next couple of weeks,

38
0:01:37.982,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I reluctantly performed meaningless calculations,

39
0:01:41.253,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:42.278,000 --> 0:01:44,000
finding imaginary solutions to quadratic equations.

41
0:01:45.245,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:46.881,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But then something amazing happened.

43
0:01:48.921,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We began finding elegant solutions

44
0:01:51.756,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to real-world problems we previously had no answers to,

45
0:01:55.685,000 --> 0:01:58,000
starting with the complex world of imaginary numbers.

46
0:01:59.758,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So some mathematician 500 years ago

47
0:02:02.538,000 --> 0:02:06,000
decides to have some fun and make up these imaginary numbers,

48
0:02:06.665,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and because of that we can now derive these amazing identities

49
0:02:11.673,000 --> 0:02:12,000
with applications in the real world,

50
0:02:13.481,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in fields like electrical engineering.

51
0:02:16.379,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Wow!

52
0:02:17.617,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I gained a whole new level of appreciation for mathematics.

53
0:02:21.858,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And after my brief mistrust,

54
0:02:24.112,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was now in love with the subject more than ever.

55
0:02:28.711,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Francis Su, the mathematician, sums it up beautifully when he says,

56
0:02:32.983,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"We study mathematics for play, for beauty,

57
0:02:37.077,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for truth,

58
0:02:38.363,000 --> 0:02:4,000
for justice and for love."

59
0:02:41.458,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But if you ask a student today,

60
0:02:43.379,000 --> 0:02:44,000
you'll probably hear a different story.

61
0:02:45.828,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You might hear "difficult" and "boring."

62
0:02:48.264,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And they might be right about difficult.

63
0:02:50.804,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But it's certainly not boring.

64
0:02:53.939,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In fact, I'd say being difficult to master

65
0:02:56.584,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is part of what makes it beautiful.

66
0:02:58.958,000 --> 0:03:,000
Because nothing worth doing is easy.

67
0:03:02.3,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So we need students to stick around long enough through the difficult parts

68
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to appreciate the beauty when it all ties together.

69
0:03:09.522,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Much like I did for that brief couple of weeks in high school.

70
0:03:14.768,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Unfortunately, our school systems --

71
0:03:17.95,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we move students through mathematics in a lockstep process.

72
0:03:21.442,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So those who fall a little behind

73
0:03:23.109,000 --> 0:03:26,000
find it near impossible to ever catch up and appreciate that beauty.

74
0:03:28.005,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But why is this a problem?

75
0:03:29.387,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why should we care?

76
0:03:31.355,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well today, more than ever,

77
0:03:32.879,000 --> 0:03:35,000
our world needs every citizen to be skilled in mathematics.

78
0:03:37.061,000 --> 0:03:4,000
With the advent of artificial intelligence and automation,

79
0:03:40.538,000 --> 0:03:42,000
many of the jobs we see today will either not exist

80
0:03:43.539,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or be transformed to require less routine work

81
0:03:46.934,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and more analysis and application of expertise.

82
0:03:50.474,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But we're not producing the extra mathematics students

83
0:03:53.022,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to fill these new roles.

84
0:03:54.3,000 --> 0:03:55,000
This graph shows the number of students

85
0:03:56.315,000 --> 0:03:58,000
taking Standard Mathematics

86
0:03:58.95,000 --> 0:04:,000
and Advanced Mathematics

87
0:04:01.228,000 --> 0:04:03,000
over a period of 20 years in Australia.

88
0:04:03.839,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's clear that while we have demand for mathematics skills rapidly increasing,

89
0:04:09.276,000 --> 0:04:11,000
supply is in steady decline.

90
0:04:13.728,000 --> 0:04:14,000
To put things in perspective,

91
0:04:15.434,000 --> 0:04:2,000
half of the students completing high school today in Australia

92
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are not prepared to understand any argument

93
0:04:23.22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
about rates of change in data.

94
0:04:26.363,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In this digital age

95
0:04:28.077,000 --> 0:04:31,000
where fake news can influence election results,

96
0:04:32.014,000 --> 0:04:34,000
this is very concerning.

97
0:04:35.458,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Let me give you a concrete example.

98
0:04:37.173,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Let's take a closer look at that graph.

99
0:04:39.673,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Can everyone see what I've done there to stress my point?

100
0:04:42.736,000 --> 0:04:45,000
If you can't, let me show you now,

101
0:04:45.871,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with the vertical axis starting at zero, where it should be.

102
0:04:49.323,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There, you see it now, right?

103
0:04:50.95,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's the exact same data

104
0:04:52.862,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but I've manipulated the representation to influence you.

105
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And that's cool, that's my job up here.

106
0:04:59.173,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:00.198,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But in all seriousness,

108
0:05:01.738,000 --> 0:05:02,000
unless we do something

109
0:05:03.072,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to drastically improve student engagement with mathematics,

110
0:05:06.72,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we'll not only have a huge skills shortage crisis

111
0:05:10.013,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but a fickle population,

112
0:05:12.316,000 --> 0:05:15,000
easily manipulated by whoever can get the most air time.

113
0:05:17.759,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So what's the solution?

114
0:05:19.76,000 --> 0:05:21,000
There are a lot of things we have to do.

115
0:05:21.884,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We need curriculum reform.

116
0:05:23.868,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We need our best and brightest encouraged to become teachers.

117
0:05:27.764,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We need to put an end to high-stakes tests

118
0:05:30.339,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and instead follow a mastery-based learning approach.

119
0:05:33.617,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But all these things take time.

120
0:05:37.157,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I'm impatient.

121
0:05:40.415,000 --> 0:05:42,000
See, I've been thinking about this for eight years now.

122
0:05:43.101,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Ever since I left my job as a derivative trader

123
0:05:46.379,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to build a web application to help students learn mathematics.

124
0:05:50.585,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Today, our app is used by schools across the globe.

125
0:05:54.411,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we're seeing big improvements

126
0:05:56.022,000 --> 0:05:58,000
for students who use the program regularly.

127
0:05:59.014,000 --> 0:06:,000
But here's the thing --

128
0:06:00.673,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we're only seeing it for students who use the program regularly.

129
0:06:06.276,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And most of them don't.

130
0:06:09.212,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So after years of developing and refining the application,

131
0:06:13.204,000 --> 0:06:16,000
our biggest challenge was not so much product related,

132
0:06:16.323,000 --> 0:06:18,000
our biggest challenge was motivating students

133
0:06:18.983,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to want to work on their gaps in understanding.

134
0:06:23.688,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You can imagine in today's attention economy,

135
0:06:25.894,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we're competing against Facebook, Snapchat and PlayStation

136
0:06:29.077,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to try and get these students' time.

137
0:06:31.982,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So we went back to the drawing board

138
0:06:33.728,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and started to think about how we could make it worthwhile

139
0:06:36.545,000 --> 0:06:39,000
for students to spend some of their "attention budget"

140
0:06:40.069,000 --> 0:06:41,000
on their education.

141
0:06:42.244,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We tinkered with gamification elements

142
0:06:44.419,000 --> 0:06:46,000
like points, badges and avatars,

143
0:06:47.291,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we'd see a temporary spike in engagement

144
0:06:50.157,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but things would go back to normal as soon as the novelty wore off.

145
0:06:54.466,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Then one day, my cofounder, Alvin,

146
0:06:56.411,000 --> 0:06:58,000
came across a study of students in Chicago

147
0:06:59.053,000 --> 0:07:01,000
led by the behavioral economist, Steven Levitt,

148
0:07:01.855,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where they paid students who improved on their test scores.

149
0:07:06.474,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He started telling me about some of the things they tested for

150
0:07:09.593,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the interesting findings they had.

151
0:07:12.03,000 --> 0:07:17,000
For instance, they found that incentivizing students for inputs,

152
0:07:17.347,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like effort,

153
0:07:18.649,000 --> 0:07:21,000
worked a lot better than incentivizing for outputs,

154
0:07:22.046,000 --> 0:07:23,000
like test scores.

155
0:07:24.188,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They found that for younger students, you could win them over with a trophy

156
0:07:27.744,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but for older students,

157
0:07:29.3,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you really needed cash.

158
0:07:30.903,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:32.276,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And the amount of cash mattered -- 10 dollars was good,

160
0:07:35.014,000 --> 0:07:36,000
20 dollars -- even better.

161
0:07:38.077,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But perhaps most importantly,

162
0:07:40.133,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they found that the rewards had to be instant

163
0:07:42.712,000 --> 0:07:44,000
rather than promised at a later date.

164
0:07:45.379,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They went as far as to give the students 20 dollars and say,

165
0:07:48.403,000 --> 0:07:5,000
"Touch it, feel it, smell it --"

166
0:07:50.434,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Sniffing)

167
0:07:51.704,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"It's all yours.

168
0:07:53.442,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But if you fail, I'm going to take it back."

169
0:07:55.688,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And that worked really well.

170
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
I immediately got excited

171
0:08:00.627,000 --> 0:08:03,000
about the possibilities of implementing this in our program.

172
0:08:03.886,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But once the excitement settled down,

173
0:08:05.903,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there were a few concerns that crept in our minds.

174
0:08:08.657,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Firstly,

175
0:08:10.069,000 --> 0:08:11,000
was this ethical?

176
0:08:11.741,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:12.781,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Secondly, how would we fund this thing?

178
0:08:15.585,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:16.76,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And finally,

180
0:08:17.958,000 --> 0:08:2,000
would the results be sustained if the students were no longer paid?

181
0:08:21.911,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, let's look at the ethical part first.

182
0:08:23.974,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I'm a bit of a mathematical purist.

183
0:08:25.864,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So I'd be one of the first people to say that we should study mathematics

184
0:08:29.624,000 --> 0:08:3,000
for the sake of mathematics.

185
0:08:31.861,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Remember -- for play, for beauty, for truth, for justice and for love!

186
0:08:36.781,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Not for money!

187
0:08:37.964,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:39.202,000 --> 0:08:41,000
As I struggled with this, I came to see that,

189
0:08:41.331,000 --> 0:08:43,000
while it's a way I look at mathematics now,

190
0:08:43.425,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's only because I studied it long enough to appreciate it.

191
0:08:47.038,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's very difficult to tell a student struggling with mathematics today

192
0:08:50.673,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to work hard for a payoff in the distant future.

193
0:08:54.306,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And it's not so much bribery that's at work here,

194
0:08:56.701,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because I could bribe students

195
0:08:58.266,000 --> 0:09:02,000
by telling them about my big bonuses in my derivative trading days

196
0:09:02.427,000 --> 0:09:03,000
as a reward for doing well at maths.

197
0:09:04.831,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But it doesn't pay off for a very long time.

198
0:09:07.592,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So it's practically naught.

199
0:09:10.149,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Behavioral economists call this hyperbolic discounting.

200
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And Levitt goes as far as to say

201
0:09:15.887,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that all motivating power vanishes

202
0:09:18.982,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when rewards are handed out with a delay.

203
0:09:21.72,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So, from a purely economic point of view:

204
0:09:26.514,000 --> 0:09:29,000
if we don't use immediate incentives,

205
0:09:29.966,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we are underinvesting in student outcomes.

206
0:09:33.474,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I took heart from that, and came to see that as a society,

207
0:09:36.339,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we're actually quite used to financial incentives.

208
0:09:38.903,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Whether it be by the government, by employers or at home.

209
0:09:42.966,000 --> 0:09:44,000
For instance, many parents would pay their children

210
0:09:45.389,000 --> 0:09:47,000
an allowance or pocket money for doing chores in the house.

211
0:09:48.557,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So it wasn't really all that controversial.

212
0:09:51.954,000 --> 0:09:52,000
As I thought about that,

213
0:09:53.153,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it started to answer that second question of how we were going to fund this.

214
0:09:56.899,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Naturally, parents are the most invested in their children's education.

215
0:10:01.075,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So, let's charge them a weekly subscription fee

216
0:10:04.625,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to use our program,

217
0:10:06.347,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but --

218
0:10:07.665,000 --> 0:10:09,000
if the students complete their weekly maths goal,

219
0:10:10.665,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we'll refund the subscription amount directly into the child's bank account.

220
0:10:16.855,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We chose three exercises completed

221
0:10:19.712,000 --> 0:10:2,000
over a one week period

222
0:10:21.483,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for a 10 dollar reward.

223
0:10:23.641,000 --> 0:10:27,000
That way we're incentivizing effort rather than performance

224
0:10:27.704,000 --> 0:10:28,000
over a short enough period

225
0:10:29.514,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and with a substantial enough payout for the students to care.

226
0:10:33.576,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, I remember when I first told my wife about this new business model.

227
0:10:37.917,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If she had any doubt left that I've gone completely mad,

228
0:10:42.736,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that pretty much confirmed it for her.

229
0:10:45.703,000 --> 0:10:46,000
She said to me, "Mo ...

230
0:10:47.236,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you realize that if everybody does their homework, which you want,

231
0:10:51.03,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you're not going to make any revenue, which you don't want.

232
0:10:54.053,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Great business model."

233
0:10:55.537,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:56.766,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I say it's more like an antibusiness model,

235
0:10:59.17,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it's free if you use it, but you pay if you don't.

236
0:11:03.101,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, I knew from experience

237
0:11:04.728,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that not everybody in the country was going to jump on

238
0:11:07.284,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and do their maths homework every week.

239
0:11:09.188,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And if they did, sure we'd go bust pretty quickly,

240
0:11:11.784,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but hey, we would have solved the country's maths skills crisis.

241
0:11:15.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:17.815,000 --> 0:11:19,000
As a company, we've always run a double bottom line,

243
0:11:20.323,000 --> 0:11:22,000
looking to both make a return for investors

244
0:11:22.387,000 --> 0:11:24,000
as well as improve student outcomes.

245
0:11:24.815,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We know that our path to long-term profitability

246
0:11:27.498,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is through improving student outcomes.

247
0:11:29.665,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So our dual objectives should never be at odds.

248
0:11:35.701,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So we're always looking

249
0:11:38.376,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to make our product decisions

250
0:11:39.812,000 --> 0:11:41,000
around helping students reach their weekly maths goal,

251
0:11:42.696,000 --> 0:11:44,000
effectively ensuring that they get paid

252
0:11:45.553,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and not us.

253
0:11:47.37,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now you must be wondering: How is this crazy business model going?

254
0:11:51.934,000 --> 0:11:53,000
You'll be glad to know we're still in business.

255
0:11:54.45,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We've been testing this now for the last five months

256
0:11:57.053,000 --> 0:11:59,000
on just our personal home users in Australia

257
0:11:59.45,000 --> 0:12:01,000
before we think about rolling it out to schools.

258
0:12:02.141,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And here are the early results.

259
0:12:04.776,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The green represents students who are completing their weekly maths goal

260
0:12:08.434,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and the red those who aren't.

261
0:12:10.315,000 --> 0:12:13,000
You can see a lot more completing their homework than not.

262
0:12:13.521,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In fact, as our user base has grown,

263
0:12:15.958,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we found the percentage to be pretty steady, at around 75 percent.

264
0:12:19.609,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So on average, we receive our weekly subscription fee

265
0:12:23.093,000 --> 0:12:25,000
once every four weeks,

266
0:12:25.315,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and the other three weeks, we're rewarding the students.

267
0:12:29.386,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now of course we're leaving some money on the table here,

268
0:12:32.094,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but guess what?

269
0:12:33.269,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It turns out these students

270
0:12:35.22,000 --> 0:12:4,000
are 70 percent more engaged than students not on the reward program.

271
0:12:41.109,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Check.

272
0:12:44.006,000 --> 0:12:46,000
From a business perspective,

273
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
they are less likely to churn

274
0:12:48.196,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and more likely to refer friends,

275
0:12:50.204,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so we're hoping to trade off a lower revenue per user

276
0:12:53.863,000 --> 0:12:55,000
for a bigger and more engaged user base.

277
0:12:56.895,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Check and check.

278
0:12:59.484,000 --> 0:13:,000
Now for that final question.

279
0:13:01.31,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Would they keep coming back if they were no longer paid?

280
0:13:04.754,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Mathematics is so much more than just a subject you study at school.

281
0:13:08.897,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It's a human endeavor.

282
0:13:10.823,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's what helps us to understand the world around us.

283
0:13:14.069,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the more you know, the more you want to know.

284
0:13:17.632,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So yes, we've triggered initial engagement

285
0:13:20.681,000 --> 0:13:21,000
with a financial reward.

286
0:13:22.649,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But in the long run,

287
0:13:24.109,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the money won't matter anymore.

288
0:13:26.034,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Because in the long run,

289
0:13:27.709,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the wonder of mathematics will be the incentive

290
0:13:30.844,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and understanding it

291
0:13:32.487,000 --> 0:13:33,000
will be the reward.

292
0:13:34.342,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Thank you.

293
0:13:35.541,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

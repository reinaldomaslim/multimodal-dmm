1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a great pleasure to be here.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a great pleasure to speak after

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Brian Cox from CERN.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think CERN is the home

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of the Large Hadron Collider.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Where is the Small Hadron Collider?

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, the Small Hadron Collider

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it was the Small Hadron Collider team

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who sabotaged it

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because they were so jealous.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The whole Hadron Collider family

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
needs unlocking.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way --

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
all those fantastic pictures --

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is this really:

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that vantage point determines everything that you see.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What Brian was saying was

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
science has opened up successively different vantage points

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
from which we can see ourselves,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and that's why it's so valuable.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So the vantage point you take

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
determines virtually everything that you will see.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The question that you will ask

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
will determine much of the answer that you get.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so if you ask this question:

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Where would you look to see the future of education?

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The answer that we've traditionally given to that

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You go to Finland.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but by golly, they are qualified.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And they have absolutely amazing education systems.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So we all troop off to Finland,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and then we struggle to imagine how we might

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
bring lessons back.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, so, for this last year,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
with the help of Cisco who sponsored me,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for some balmy reason, to do this,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I've been looking somewhere else.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
come from the very best,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but it often comes from places

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
where you have huge need --

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
unmet, latent demand --

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work --

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
traditional, high-cost solutions,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which depend on professionals,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which is what schools and hospitals are.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I ended up in places like this.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a place called Monkey Hill.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
will be in cities.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for the next 30 years.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Almost all of that growth will be

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in places like Monkey Hill.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is where you'll find the fastest growing

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
young populations of the world.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So if you want recipes to work --

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for virtually anything -- health, education,

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
government politics

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and education --

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you have to go to these places.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And if you go to these places, you meet people like this.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This is a guy called Juanderson.

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
At the age of 14,

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
he dropped out of school.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It was boring.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And Juanderson, instead, went into

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
what provided kind of opportunity and hope

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
He employed 200 people.

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He was going to be dead by the age of 25.

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And luckily, he met this guy,

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who is Rodrigo Baggio,

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
1994, Rodrigo started something

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
called CDI,

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which took computers

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
donated by corporations,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
put them into community centers in favelas

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and created places like this.

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What turned Juanderson around

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
was technology for learning

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that made learning fun and accessible.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Or you can go to places like this.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Millions of people living here,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
stretched over many kilometers.

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And there I met these two,

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Azra on the left, Maureen on the right.

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They just finished their Kenyan certificate

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of secondary education.

108
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system

109
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
borrows almost everything

110
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
from Britain, circa 1950,

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but has managed to make it even worse.

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So there are schools in slums like this.

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They're places like this.

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's where Maureen went to school.

115
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.

116
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And the education they got was pitiful.

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in another slum called Nakuru.

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Half the children in this classroom have no parents

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because they've died through AIDS.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
The other half have one parent

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because the other parent has died through AIDS.

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So the challenges of education

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in this kind of place

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They are to stay alive, to earn a living,

127
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to not become HIV positive.

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The one technology that spans rich and poor

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in places like this

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is not anything to do with industrial technology.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's not to do with electricity or water.

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's the mobile phone.

133
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If you want to design from scratch

134
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
virtually any service in Africa,

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you would start now with the mobile phone.

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Or you could go to places like this.

137
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,

138
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which is a very developed slum

139
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
about 25 minutes outside New Delhi,

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where I met these characters

141
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who showed me around for the day.

142
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The remarkable thing about these girls,

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the sign of the kind of social revolution

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
sweeping through the developing world

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is that these girls are not married.

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Ten years ago, they certainly would have been married.

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now they're not married, and they want to go on

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to study further, to have a career.

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who have never ever done homework.

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
All across the developing world there are millions of parents --

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
tens, hundreds of millions --

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who for the first time

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are with children doing homework and exams.

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And the reason they carry on studying

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is not because they went to a school like this.

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is a private school.

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is the best you can get

160
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in Hyderabad in Indian education.

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The reason they went on studying was this.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by a revolutionary social entrepreneur

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
called Sugata Mitra

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
who has conducted the most radical experiments,

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
showing that children, in the right conditions,

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
can learn on their own with the help of computers.

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Those girls have never touched Google.

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They know nothing about Wikipedia.

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Imagine what their lives would be like

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
if you could get that to them.

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So if you look, as I did,

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
through this tour,

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and by looking at about a hundred case studies

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of different social entrepreneurs

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
working in these very extreme conditions,

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
look at the recipes that they come up with for learning,

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they look nothing like school.

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
What do they look like?

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well, education is a global religion.

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And education, plus technology,

182
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is a great source of hope.

183
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You can go to places like this.

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Many of them don't have electricity at home.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But they find it completely obvious

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to use computers, websites,

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
make videos, so on and so forth.

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
When you go to places like this

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
what you see is that

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
education in these settings

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
works by pull, not push.

194
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Most of our education system is push.

195
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I was literally pushed to school.

196
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When you get to school, things are pushed at you:

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
knowledge, exams,

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
systems, timetables.

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If you want to attract people like Juanderson

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
who could, for instance,

201
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
buy guns, wear jewelry,

202
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
ride motorbikes and get girls

203
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
through the drugs trade,

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and you want to attract him into education,

205
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.

206
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That isn't really going to attract him.

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You need to pull him.

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And so education needs to work by pull, not push.

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so the idea of a curriculum

210
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is completely irrelevant in a setting like this.

211
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You need to start education

212
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
from things that make a difference

213
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to them in their settings.

214
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
What does that?

215
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.

216
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation,

217
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that education has a payoff.

218
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Our education systems all work

219
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
on the principle that there is a payoff,

220
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but you have to wait quite a long time.

221
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
That's too long if you're poor.

222
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education

223
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
is too long when you need to meet daily needs,

224
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when you've got siblings to look after

225
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or a business to help with.

226
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So you need education to be relevant and help people

227
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to make a living there and then, often.

228
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.

229
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So time and again, I found people like this.

230
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,

231
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in Belo Horizonte,

232
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in the third largest city in Brazil.

233
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He's invented more than 200 games

234
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to teach virtually any subject under the sun.

235
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In the schools and communities

236
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that Taio works in,

237
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the day always starts in a circle

238
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and always starts from a question.

239
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Imagine an education system that started from questions,

240
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
not from knowledge to be imparted,

241
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
or started from a game, not from a lesson,

242
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or started from the premise

243
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that you have to engage people first

244
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
before you can possibly teach them.

245
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Our education systems,

246
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,

247
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
sport, drama, music.

248
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
These things, they teach through.

249
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They attract people to learning

250
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because it's really a dance project

251
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or a circus project

252
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or, the best example of all --

253
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
El Sistema in Venezuela --

254
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it's a music project.

255
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so you attract people through that into learning,

256
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
not adding that on after

257
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
all the learning has been done

258
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and you've eaten your cognitive greens.

259
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So El Sistema in Venezuela

260
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
uses a violin as a technology of learning.

261
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Taio Rocha uses making soap

262
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
as a technology of learning.

263
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And what you find when you go to these schemes

264
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is that they use people and places

265
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in incredibly creative ways.

266
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Masses of peer learning.

267
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
How do you get learning to people

268
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
when there are no teachers,

269
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
when teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,

270
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and even if you do get teachers,

271
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?

272
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Well, you create your own teachers.

273
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You create peer-to-peer learning,

274
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.

275
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people

276
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
through technology, people and places that are different.

277
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So this is a school in a bus

278
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
on a building site

279
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.

280
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Pune has 5,000 building sites.

281
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It has 30,000 children

282
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
on those building sites.

283
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That's one city.

284
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Imagine that urban explosion

285
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that's going to take place across the developing world

286
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and how many thousands of children

287
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
will spend their school years on building sites.

288
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Well, this is a very simple scheme

289
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to get the learning to them through a bus.

290
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And they all treat learning,

291
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
not as some sort of academic, analytical activity,

292
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but as that's something that's productive,

293
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
something you make,

294
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.

295
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So I met this character, Steven.

296
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets

297
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because his parents had died of AIDS.

298
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And he was finally brought back into school,

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
not by the offer of GCSEs,

300
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,

301
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
a practical making skill.

302
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So the trendiest schools in the world,

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
High Tech High and others,

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.

305
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Here, there isn't really an option.

306
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Learning has to be productive

307
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in order for it to make sense.

308
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And finally, they have a different model of scale,

309
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and it's a Chinese restaurant model

310
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
of how to scale.

311
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And I learned it from this guy,

312
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
who is an amazing character.

313
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur

314
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in education in the world.

315
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
His name is Madhav Chavan,

316
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and he created something called Pratham.

317
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And Pratham runs preschool play groups

318
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for, now, 21 million children in India.

319
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's the largest NGO in education in the world.

320
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.

321
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
He's a complete revolutionary.

322
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
He's actually a trade union organizer by background,

323
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and that's how he learned the skills

324
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to build his organization.

325
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When they got to a certain stage,

326
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Pratham got big enough to attract

327
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
some pro bono support from McKinsey.

328
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,

329
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?

330
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You should turn it into McDonald's.

331
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And what you do when you go to any new site

332
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is you kind of roll out a franchise.

333
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And it's the same wherever you go.

334
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are.

335
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And there will be no mistakes."

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And Madhav said,

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Why do we have to do it that way?

338
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"

339
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There are Chinese restaurants everywhere,

340
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.

341
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.

342
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different

343
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and the colors will be different and the name will be different.

344
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.

345
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
These people work with the Chinese restaurant model --

346
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
same principles, different applications and different settings --

347
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
not the McDonald's model.

348
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The McDonald's model scales.

349
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The Chinese restaurant model spreads.

350
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
So mass education

351
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
started with social entrepreneurship

352
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in the 19th century.

353
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And that's desperately what we need again

354
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
on a global scale.

355
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And what can we learn from all of that?

356
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Well, we can learn a lot

357
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because our education systems

358
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
are failing desperately in many ways.

359
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They fail to reach the people

360
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
they most need to serve.

361
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They often hit their target but miss the point.

362
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Improvement is increasingly

363
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
difficult to organize;

364
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.

365
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And this is just a very simple way of

366
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
understanding what kind of innovation,

367
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
what kind of different design we need.

368
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
There are two basic types of innovation.

369
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There's sustaining innovation,

370
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
which will sustain an existing institution or an organization,

371
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and disruptive innovation

372
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.

373
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
There are formal settings --

374
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
schools, colleges, hospitals --

375
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in which innovation can take place,

376
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and informal settings -- communities,

377
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
families, social networks.

378
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Almost all our effort goes in this box,

379
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
sustaining innovation in formal settings,

380
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
getting a better version

381
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
of the essentially Bismarckian school system

382
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that developed in the 19th century.

383
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And as I said, the trouble with this is that,

384
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in the developing world

385
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
there just aren't teachers to make this model work.

386
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You'd need millions and millions of teachers

387
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
in China, India, Nigeria

388
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and the rest of developing world to meet need.

389
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And in our system, we know

390
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that simply doing more of this won't eat into

391
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
deep educational inequalities,

392
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
especially in inner cities

393
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and former industrial areas.

394
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.

395
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We need more reinvention.

396
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And all around the world now you see

397
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
more and more schools reinventing themselves.

398
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
They're recognizably schools, but they look different.

399
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
There are Big Picture schools

400
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
in the U.S. and Australia.

401
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
There are Kunskapsskolan schools

402
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in Sweden.

403
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Of 14 of them,

404
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
only two of them are in schools.

405
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.

406
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland

407
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
called Jaringan.

408
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And they all have the same kind of features:

409
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
highly collaborative, very personalized,

410
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
often pervasive technology,

411
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
learning that starts from questions

412
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and problems and projects,

413
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
not from knowledge and curriculum.

414
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So we certainly need more of that.

415
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
But because so many of the issues in education

416
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
aren't just in school,

417
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
they're in family and community,

418
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
what you also need, definitely,

419
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is more on the right hand side.

420
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
You need efforts to supplement schools.

421
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,

422
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the family-based learning system

423
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to support and encourage people in schools.

424
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,

425
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,

426
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
has, through a mixture of schooling

427
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and family and community projects,

428
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
attempted to transform not just education in schools,

429
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
but the entire culture and aspiration

430
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
of about 10,000 families in Harlem.

431
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
We need more of that

432
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
completely new and radical thinking.

433
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
You can go to places an hour away, less,

434
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
from this room,

435
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
just down the road, which need that,

436
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.

437
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And finally, you need transformational innovation

438
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that could imagine getting learning to people

439
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
in completely new and different ways.

440
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
So we are on the verge, 2015,

441
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
of an amazing achievement,

442
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
the schoolification of the world.

443
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school

444
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
will be able to have one in 2015.

445
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
It's an amazing thing.

446
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But it is,

447
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
unlike cars, which have developed

448
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
so rapidly and orderly,

449
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
actually the school system is recognizably

450
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
an inheritance from the 19th century,

451
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
from a Bismarkian model of German schooling

452
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that got taken up by English reformers,

453
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and often by

454
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
religious missionaries,

455
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
taken up in the United States

456
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
as a force of social cohesion,

457
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.

458
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
It's recognizably 19th century in its roots.

459
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And of course it's a huge achievement.

460
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And of course it will bring great things.

461
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
It will bring skills and learning and reading.

462
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But it will also lay waste to imagination.

463
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.

464
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
It will stratify society

465
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
as much as it liberates it.

466
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And we are bequeathing to the developing world

467
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
school systems that they will now spend

468
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
a century trying to reform.

469
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
That is why we need really radical thinking,

470
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and why radical thinking is now

471
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn.

472
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Thank you. (Applause)

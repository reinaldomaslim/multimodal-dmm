1
0:00:25.515,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which is called "Blink,"

3
0:00:29.903,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

5
0:00:36.815,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:38.313,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I was thinking about this,

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I realized that although my new book makes me happy,

8
0:00:44.234,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I think would make my mother happy,

9
0:00:46.894,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it's not really about happiness.

10
0:00:49.376,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who I think has done as much to make Americans happy

12
0:00:56.703,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,

13
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a man who is a great personal hero of mine:

14
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,

15
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

16
0:01:10.323,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Howard's about this high, and he's round,

17
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses

18
0:01:20.113,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and thinning gray hair,

19
0:01:21.93,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,

20
0:01:25.778,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,

21
0:01:28.81,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and he's a great aficionado of medieval history.

22
0:01:33.203,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.

23
0:01:35.831,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,

24
0:01:40.492,000 --> 0:01:41,000
although at some point in my life,

25
0:01:42.206,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I dated a girl for two years

26
0:01:43.676,000 --> 0:01:45,000
who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.

27
0:01:45.94,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Which should tell you something about that relationship.

28
0:01:49.508,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:51.829,000 --> 0:01:54,000
As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.

30
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And Howard is very interested in measuring things.

31
0:01:57.655,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,

32
0:02:00.052,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.

33
0:02:04.055,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And one of his first clients was Pepsi.

34
0:02:06.437,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This is many years ago, back in the early 70s.

35
0:02:10.444,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,

36
0:02:12.38,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame,

37
0:02:14.802,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.

38
0:02:16.71,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We'd like you to figure out

39
0:02:18.711,000 --> 0:02:21,000
how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi

40
0:02:22.241,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in order to have the perfect drink."

41
0:02:24.721,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,

42
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and that's what Howard thought.

43
0:02:30.501,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Because Pepsi told him,

44
0:02:31.826,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.

45
0:02:34.533,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;

46
0:02:37.476,000 --> 0:02:4,000
anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.

47
0:02:40.739,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?"

48
0:02:44.372,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.

49
0:02:48.357,000 --> 0:02:51,000
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,

50
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,

51
0:02:56.51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
all the way up to 12 --

52
0:02:57.815,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we try this out with thousands of people,

53
0:03:00.328,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we plot the results on a curve,

54
0:03:02.558,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and we take the most popular concentration, right?

55
0:03:05.563,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Really simple.

56
0:03:06.842,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back,

57
0:03:09.406,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and he plots it on a curve,

58
0:03:10.771,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.

59
0:03:13.659,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.

60
0:03:15.637,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's a mess. It's all over the place.

61
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,

62
0:03:22.637,000 --> 0:03:24,000
are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.

63
0:03:25.478,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They think, "Well, you know,

64
0:03:26.994,000 --> 0:03:28,000
figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy."

65
0:03:29.852,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way."

66
0:03:32.701,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"You know, let's just make an educated guess,"

67
0:03:34.922,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and they simply point and they go for 10 percent,

68
0:03:37.331,000 --> 0:03:38,000
right in the middle.

69
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Howard is not so easily placated.

70
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.

71
0:03:43.936,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And this was not good enough for him,

72
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and this question bedeviled him for years.

73
0:03:48.306,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And he would think it through and say, "What was wrong?

74
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"

75
0:03:55.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,

76
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé.

77
0:04:01.336,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.

78
0:04:05.153,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,

79
0:04:07.851,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they were asking the wrong question.

80
0:04:09.597,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,

81
0:04:11.751,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.

82
0:04:15.814,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Trust me.

83
0:04:16.849,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This was an enormous revelation.

84
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.

85
0:04:22.699,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Howard immediately went on the road,

86
0:04:24.441,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and he would go to conferences around the country,

87
0:04:26.823,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and he would stand up and say,

88
0:04:28.405,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi.

89
0:04:30.492,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You're wrong.

90
0:04:31.746,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."

91
0:04:34.857,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And people would look at him blankly and say,

92
0:04:37.317,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"What are you talking about? Craziness."

93
0:04:39.404,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they would say, "Move! Next!"

94
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Tried to get business, nobody would hire him --

95
0:04:43.238,000 --> 0:04:44,000
he was obsessed, though,

96
0:04:44.646,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and he talked about it and talked about it.

97
0:04:46.677,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Howard loves the Yiddish expression

98
0:04:48.494,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."

99
0:04:51.541,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This was his horseradish.

100
0:04:53.165,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:54.851,000 --> 0:04:55,000
He was obsessed with it!

102
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And finally, he had a breakthrough.

103
0:04:59.835,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Vlasic Pickles came to him,

104
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle."

105
0:05:06.673,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And he said,

106
0:05:07.721,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."

107
0:05:11.331,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he came back to them and he said,

108
0:05:13.125,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"You don't just need to improve your regular;

109
0:05:15.359,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you need to create zesty."

110
0:05:16.876,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And that's where we got zesty pickles.

111
0:05:19.516,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup.

112
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And this was even more important.

113
0:05:24.024,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.

114
0:05:27.42,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Campbell's made Prego,

115
0:05:28.837,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù,

116
0:05:32.729,000 --> 0:05:35,000
which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.

117
0:05:36.546,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this,

118
0:05:39.413,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or how much time I have to go into this.

119
0:05:41.437,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But it was, technically speaking -- this is an aside --

120
0:05:44.091,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.

121
0:05:46.175,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The quality of the tomato paste is much better;

122
0:05:48.48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the spice mix is far superior;

123
0:05:50.324,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.

124
0:05:52.834,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In fact, they would do the famous bowl test

125
0:05:54.935,000 --> 0:05:56,000
back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.

126
0:05:57.604,000 --> 0:06:,000
You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?

127
0:06:01.46,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.

128
0:06:06.129,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's called "adherence."

129
0:06:07.684,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,

130
0:06:12.248,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and the quality of their tomato paste,

131
0:06:15.043,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Prego was struggling.

132
0:06:16.436,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.

133
0:06:19.811,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And Howard looked at their product line, and he said,

134
0:06:22.334,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what you have is a dead tomato society.

135
0:06:26.183,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So he said, this is what I want to do.

136
0:06:28.389,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,

137
0:06:30.969,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.

138
0:06:34.454,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And he varied them according to every conceivable way

139
0:06:37.331,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that you can vary tomato sauce:

140
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by sweetness, by level of garlic,

141
0:06:40.882,000 --> 0:06:43,000
by tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness,

142
0:06:44.121,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by visible solids --

143
0:06:45.485,000 --> 0:06:48,000
my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.

144
0:06:48.77,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

145
0:06:49.795,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce,

146
0:06:53.357,000 --> 0:06:54,000
he varied spaghetti sauce.

147
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces,

148
0:06:58.917,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and he went on the road.

149
0:07:00.098,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He went to New York, to Chicago,

150
0:07:02.001,000 --> 0:07:03,000
he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.

151
0:07:03.954,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls.

152
0:07:07.74,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And he sat them down for two hours,

153
0:07:09.489,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.

154
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Ten small bowls of pasta,

155
0:07:14.122,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.

156
0:07:17.185,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,

157
0:07:21.355,000 --> 0:07:23,000
how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.

158
0:07:24.49,000 --> 0:07:27,000
At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,

159
0:07:27.585,000 --> 0:07:28,000
he had a mountain of data

160
0:07:29.152,000 --> 0:07:32,000
about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.

161
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And then he analyzed the data.

162
0:07:34.491,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce?

163
0:07:38.492,000 --> 0:07:4,000
No! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.

164
0:07:41.27,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said,

165
0:07:43.357,000 --> 0:07:48,000
let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.

166
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas.

167
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And sure enough, if you sit down,

168
0:07:54.229,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,

169
0:07:57.818,000 --> 0:08:,000
you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.

170
0:08:01.34,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;

171
0:08:04.277,000 --> 0:08:06,000
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;

172
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and there are people who like it extra chunky.

173
0:08:09.929,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,

174
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because at the time, in the early 1980s,

175
0:08:16.678,000 --> 0:08:17,000
if you went to a supermarket,

176
0:08:18.202,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.

177
0:08:21.987,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,

178
0:08:24.024,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"You're telling me that one third of Americans

179
0:08:26.745,000 --> 0:08:29,000
crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce

180
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and yet no one is servicing their needs?"

181
0:08:32.523,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And he said "Yes!"

182
0:08:33.571,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:34.887,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And Prego then went back,

184
0:08:36.253,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,

185
0:08:38.649,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely

186
0:08:42.327,000 --> 0:08:44,000
took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.

187
0:08:45.335,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars

188
0:08:49.762,000 --> 0:08:51,000
off their line of extra-chunky sauces.

189
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,

190
0:08:56.514,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"

191
0:08:58.945,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,

192
0:09:02.239,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil.

193
0:09:07.729,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And then eventually even Ragù hired Howard,

194
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego.

195
0:09:14.215,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And today, if you go to a really good supermarket,

196
0:09:16.59,000 --> 0:09:18,000
do you know how many Ragùs there are?

197
0:09:18.757,000 --> 0:09:19,000
36!

198
0:09:20.967,000 --> 0:09:21,000
In six varieties:

199
0:09:22.561,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Cheese, Light,

200
0:09:25.635,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Robusto, Rich & Hearty,

201
0:09:28.761,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Old World Traditional --

202
0:09:32.483,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Extra-Chunky Garden.

203
0:09:34.224,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That's Howard's doing.

205
0:09:37.768,000 --> 0:09:39,000
That is Howard's gift to the American people.

206
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now why is that important?

207
0:09:41.705,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

208
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It is, in fact, enormously important.

209
0:09:46.105,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I'll explain to you why.

210
0:09:47.499,000 --> 0:09:51,000
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks

211
0:09:51.644,000 --> 0:09:52,000
about making you happy.

212
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be

213
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that the way to find out what people want to eat,

214
0:09:59.724,000 --> 0:10:01,000
what will make people happy, is to ask them.

215
0:10:02.628,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And for years and years and years,

216
0:10:04.31,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,

217
0:10:06.572,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and they would sit you down, and they would say,

218
0:10:09.056,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?

219
0:10:10.953,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."

220
0:10:13.052,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --

221
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
through all those focus group sessions,

222
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.

223
0:10:21.754,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.

224
0:10:25.229,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:27.696,000 --> 0:10:29,000
People don't know what they want!

226
0:10:29.732,000 --> 0:10:3,000
As Howard loves to say,

227
0:10:31.202,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"The mind knows not what the tongue wants."

228
0:10:33.978,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's a mystery!

229
0:10:35.154,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:36.182,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And a critically important step

231
0:10:38.612,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in understanding our own desires and tastes

232
0:10:41.967,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.

233
0:10:46.242,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,

234
0:10:50.302,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you know what you'd say?

235
0:10:51.654,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."

236
0:10:56.555,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's what people always say when you ask them.

237
0:10:58.737,000 --> 0:11:,000
"What do you like?" "Dark, rich, hearty roast!"

238
0:11:01.293,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?

239
0:11:04.83,000 --> 0:11:07,000
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.

240
0:11:08.567,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.

241
0:11:10.786,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:11.811,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want

243
0:11:15.167,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that "I want a milky, weak coffee."

244
0:11:17.382,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So that's number one thing that Howard did.

245
0:11:21.528,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize --

246
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
it's another very critical point --

247
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
he made us realize the importance

248
0:11:29.198,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."

249
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Why is this critical?

250
0:11:34.039,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard.

251
0:11:37.761,000 --> 0:11:39,000
What were they obsessed with in the early 80s?

252
0:11:40.095,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They were obsessed with mustard.

253
0:11:41.659,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.

254
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's.

255
0:11:48.225,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What were they? Yellow mustard.

256
0:11:49.742,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What's in it?

257
0:11:50.781,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika.

258
0:11:52.859,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That was mustard.

259
0:11:53.957,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.

260
0:11:56.506,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Right?

261
0:11:57.718,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,

262
0:12:03.405,000 --> 0:12:04,000
much more delicate aromatics.

263
0:12:05.367,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And what do they do?

264
0:12:06.406,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,

265
0:12:11.229,000 --> 0:12:12,000
made it look French,

266
0:12:12.327,000 --> 0:12:14,000
even though it's made in Oxnard, California.

267
0:12:14.452,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:15.477,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,

269
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the way that French's and Gulden's did,

270
0:12:21.997,000 --> 0:12:22,000
they decided to charge four dollars.

271
0:12:23.748,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And they had those ads.

272
0:12:24.984,000 --> 0:12:26,000
With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.

273
0:12:27.643,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Another pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?"

274
0:12:30.453,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!

275
0:12:33.661,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Takes over the mustard business!

276
0:12:35.209,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And everyone's take-home lesson from that

277
0:12:37.241,000 --> 0:12:41,000
was that the way to make people happy

278
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is to give them something that is more expensive,

279
0:12:45.418,000 --> 0:12:47,000
something to aspire to.

280
0:12:47.509,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,

281
0:12:51.676,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.

282
0:12:55.119,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Laughter)

283
0:12:56.144,000 --> 0:12:58,000
A better mustard! A more expensive mustard!

284
0:12:58.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.

285
0:13:01.567,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!"

286
0:13:04.639,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.

287
0:13:07.218,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.

288
0:13:11.779,000 --> 0:13:13,000
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.

289
0:13:14.542,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.

290
0:13:17.092,000 --> 0:13:2,000
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.

291
0:13:21.358,000 --> 0:13:25,000
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.

292
0:13:26.217,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.

293
0:13:31.201,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,

294
0:13:34.718,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.

295
0:13:37.581,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

296
0:13:38.606,000 --> 0:13:39,000
What do I mean by that?

297
0:13:39.772,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

298
0:13:41.352,000 --> 0:13:43,000
For the longest time in the food industry,

299
0:13:43.476,000 --> 0:13:45,000
there was a sense that there was one way,

300
0:13:46.08,000 --> 0:13:48,000
a perfect way, to make a dish.

301
0:13:49.57,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You go to Chez Panisse,

302
0:13:51.309,000 --> 0:13:56,000
they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds

303
0:13:56.616,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in a something something reduction.

304
0:13:58.493,000 --> 0:14:,000
They don't give you five options on the reduction.

305
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They don't say, "Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"

306
0:14:04.618,000 --> 0:14:05,000
No!

307
0:14:05.65,000 --> 0:14:06,000
You just get the reduction. Why?

308
0:14:07.221,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Because the chef at Chez Panisse

309
0:14:08.807,000 --> 0:14:1,000
has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.

310
0:14:11.419,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"This is the way it ought to be."

311
0:14:13.92,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And she serves it that way time and time again,

312
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and if you quarrel with her, she will say,

313
0:14:20.286,000 --> 0:14:21,000
"You know what? You're wrong!

314
0:14:22.468,000 --> 0:14:24,000
This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."

315
0:14:25.212,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.

316
0:14:29.294,000 --> 0:14:32,000
They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was.

317
0:14:32.535,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And where did that come from? It came from Italy.

318
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Italian tomato sauce is what?

319
0:14:37.375,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It's blended; it's thin.

320
0:14:39.531,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.

321
0:14:41.864,000 --> 0:14:43,000
When we talked about "authentic tomato sauce" in the 1970s,

322
0:14:44.865,000 --> 0:14:45,000
we talked about Italian tomato sauce,

323
0:14:46.698,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we talked about the earliest Ragùs,

324
0:14:48.501,000 --> 0:14:5,000
which had no visible solids, right?

325
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Which were thin, you just put a little bit

326
0:14:53.141,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.

327
0:14:55.213,000 --> 0:14:56,000
That's what it was.

328
0:14:56.429,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And why were we attached to that?

329
0:14:58.114,000 --> 0:15:,000
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy

330
0:15:00.876,000 --> 0:15:04,000
was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.

331
0:15:05.494,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,

332
0:15:10.602,000 --> 0:15:11,000
then they would embrace it.

333
0:15:12.054,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And that's what would please the maximum number of people.

334
0:15:15.288,000 --> 0:15:17,000
In other words,

335
0:15:17.598,000 --> 0:15:2,000
people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.

336
0:15:21.336,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They were looking for one way to treat all of us.

337
0:15:23.798,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And it's good reason for them to be obsessed

338
0:15:26.402,000 --> 0:15:27,000
with the idea of universals,

339
0:15:27.808,000 --> 0:15:28,000
because all of science,

340
0:15:29.229,000 --> 0:15:31,000
through the 19th century and much of the 20th,

341
0:15:31.502,000 --> 0:15:32,000
was obsessed with universals.

342
0:15:33.195,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Psychologists, medical scientists, economists

343
0:15:37.207,000 --> 0:15:39,000
were all interested in finding out the rules

344
0:15:39.319,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that govern the way all of us behave.

345
0:15:42.259,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But that changed, right?

346
0:15:43.681,000 --> 0:15:46,000
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?

347
0:15:47.316,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It is the movement from the search for universals

348
0:15:50.855,000 --> 0:15:51,000
to the understanding of variability.

349
0:15:53.339,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily,

350
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:58,000
just how cancer works,

351
0:15:58.725,000 --> 0:16:01,000
we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.

352
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I guess my cancer different from your cancer.

353
0:16:04.771,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.

354
0:16:08.883,000 --> 0:16:1,000
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying,

355
0:16:11.002,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce."

356
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.

357
0:16:20.201,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I'll give you one last illustration of variability,

358
0:16:23.067,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.

359
0:16:24.932,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step,

360
0:16:28.444,000 --> 0:16:33,000
which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,

361
0:16:33.62,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we aren't just making an error;

362
0:16:35.264,000 --> 0:16:38,000
we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.

363
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And the example he used was coffee.

364
0:16:41.223,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé.

365
0:16:45.746,000 --> 0:16:48,000
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee --

366
0:16:49.268,000 --> 0:16:52,000
a type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy,

367
0:16:52.314,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and then I asked you to rate that coffee,

368
0:16:54.291,000 --> 0:16:58,000
the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.

369
0:16:58.825,000 --> 0:17:01,000
If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,

370
0:17:02.472,000 --> 0:17:03,000
maybe three or four coffee clusters,

371
0:17:04.281,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,

372
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.

373
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78

374
0:17:18.261,000 --> 0:17:2,000
is a difference between coffee that makes you wince,

375
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.

376
0:17:24.69,000 --> 0:17:27,000
That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson,

377
0:17:27.908,000 --> 0:17:28,000
of Howard Moskowitz:

378
0:17:29.267,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that in embracing the diversity of human beings,

379
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
we will find a surer way to true happiness.

380
0:17:35.769,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you.

381
0:17:36.81,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

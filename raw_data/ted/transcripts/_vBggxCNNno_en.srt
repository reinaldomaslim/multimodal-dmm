1
0:00:13.087,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So whenever I visit a school and talk to students,

2
0:00:15.604,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I always ask them the same thing:

3
0:00:18.754,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Why do you Google?

4
0:00:20.624,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why is Google the search engine of choice for you?

5
0:00:24.855,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers.

6
0:00:27.431,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One, "Because it works,"

7
0:00:29.494,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too.

8
0:00:32.424,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Two, somebody will say,

9
0:00:34.481,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"I really don't know of any alternatives."

10
0:00:37.708,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually,

11
0:00:40.86,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'

12
0:00:42.805,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you may find a couple of interesting alternatives."

13
0:00:45.231,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And last but not least, thirdly,

14
0:00:47.35,000 --> 0:00:5,000
inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say,

15
0:00:50.684,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result."

16
0:00:57.157,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.

17
0:01:05.091,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, as a man of the humanities,

18
0:01:07.505,000 --> 0:01:09,000
albeit a digital humanities man,

19
0:01:09.71,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that just makes my skin curl,

20
0:01:11.472,000 --> 0:01:15,000
even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result

21
0:01:16.382,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google.

22
0:01:20.658,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.

23
0:01:24.94,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle

24
0:01:28.218,000 --> 0:01:31,000
behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget.

25
0:01:31.851,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So whenever you set out to Google something,

26
0:01:33.955,000 --> 0:01:36,000
start by asking yourself this: "Am I looking for an isolated fact?"

27
0:01:38.334,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What is the capital of France?

28
0:01:41.519,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What are the building blocks of a water molecule?

29
0:01:43.968,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Great -- Google away.

30
0:01:46.333,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving

31
0:01:49.477,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that it's actually London and H30.

32
0:01:51.498,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You don't see a big conspiracy among those things.

33
0:01:53.893,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We agree, on a global scale,

34
0:01:55.45,000 --> 0:01:57,000
what the answers are to these isolated facts.

35
0:01:58.199,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like,

36
0:02:03.525,000 --> 0:02:05,000
"Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"

37
0:02:06.978,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore,

38
0:02:09.642,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you're looking for knowledge,

39
0:02:11.499,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which is something way more complicated and delicate.

40
0:02:14.6,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And to get to knowledge,

41
0:02:16.173,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table

42
0:02:19.228,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and acknowledge them and say, "Yes, these are all true."

43
0:02:22.228,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But because of who I am,

44
0:02:23.926,000 --> 0:02:25,000
young or old, black or white, gay or straight,

45
0:02:26.22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I will value them differently.

46
0:02:27.855,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I will say, "Yes, this is true,

47
0:02:29.567,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but this is more important to me than that."

48
0:02:31.705,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And this is where it becomes interesting,

49
0:02:33.719,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because this is where we become human.

50
0:02:35.889,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is when we start to argue, to form society.

51
0:02:38.909,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here,

52
0:02:42.29,000 --> 0:02:44,000
through friends and neighbors and parents and children

53
0:02:44.87,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and coworkers and newspapers and magazines,

54
0:02:46.926,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to finally be grounded in real knowledge,

55
0:02:50.03,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve.

56
0:02:55.284,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard

57
0:03:01.636,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge --

58
0:03:05.064,000 --> 0:03:06,000
as food for thought.

59
0:03:06.556,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries.

60
0:03:10.473,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"

61
0:03:14.537,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the First Lady of the United States.

62
0:03:16.365,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And we'll click for pictures.

63
0:03:19.007,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It works really well, as you can see.

64
0:03:21.303,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's a perfect search result, more or less.

65
0:03:24.355,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's just her in the picture, not even the President.

66
0:03:27.664,000 --> 0:03:28,000
How does this work?

67
0:03:29.837,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Quite simple.

68
0:03:31.233,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply,

69
0:03:34.472,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they look at two things more than anything.

70
0:03:36.556,000 --> 0:03:41,000
First, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website?

71
0:03:41.736,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Does it say "Michelle Obama" under the picture?

72
0:03:43.975,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Pretty good indication it's actually her on there.

73
0:03:46.355,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Second, Google looks at the picture file,

74
0:03:48.765,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the name of the file as such uploaded to the website.

75
0:03:51.821,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?

76
0:03:54.839,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture.

77
0:03:57.785,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, you've got those two and you get a search result like this -- almost.

78
0:04:02.074,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign,

79
0:04:08.701,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where people set out to insult her through her search results.

80
0:04:13.43,000 --> 0:04:15,000
There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet

81
0:04:16.156,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where her face was distorted to look like a monkey.

82
0:04:18.824,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And that picture was published all over.

83
0:04:22.017,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And people published it very, very purposefully,

84
0:04:25.802,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to get it up there in the search results.

85
0:04:27.797,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They made sure to write "Michelle Obama" in the caption

86
0:04:30.776,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and they made sure to upload the picture as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.

87
0:04:34.977,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You get why -- to manipulate the search result.

88
0:04:37.368,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And it worked, too.

89
0:04:38.687,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009,

90
0:04:41.431,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results.

91
0:04:44.842,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, the results are self-cleansing,

92
0:04:48.432,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and that's sort of the beauty of it,

93
0:04:50.209,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because Google measures relevance every hour, every day.

94
0:04:53.636,000 --> 0:04:55,000
However, Google didn't settle for that this time,

95
0:04:56.374,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they just thought, "That's racist and it's a bad search result

96
0:04:59.522,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we're going to go back and clean that up manually.

97
0:05:02.681,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We are going to write some code and fix it,"

98
0:05:05.637,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which they did.

99
0:05:07.454,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea.

100
0:05:11.789,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Me neither.

101
0:05:14.802,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But then, a couple of years go by,

102
0:05:17.858,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and the world's most-Googled Anders,

103
0:05:20.866,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Anders Behring Breivik,

104
0:05:23.169,000 --> 0:05:24,000
did what he did.

105
0:05:24.899,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is July 22 in 2011,

106
0:05:26.924,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and a terrible day in Norwegian history.

107
0:05:29.597,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings

108
0:05:33.408,000 --> 0:05:35,000
walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway

109
0:05:36.315,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and then he traveled to the island of Utøya

110
0:05:38.39,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and shot and killed a group of kids.

111
0:05:41.113,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Almost 80 people died that day.

112
0:05:44.397,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps,

113
0:05:48.98,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids.

114
0:05:52.415,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's not true.

115
0:05:54.326,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It was three steps.

116
0:05:56.493,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids,

117
0:05:58.731,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him.

118
0:06:03.227,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And he prepared all three steps equally well.

119
0:06:06.544,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And if there was somebody who immediately understood this,

120
0:06:09.358,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it was a Swedish web developer,

121
0:06:10.906,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.

122
0:06:14.553,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He's also a very political guy

123
0:06:16.165,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook.

124
0:06:19.465,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And he told everybody,

125
0:06:20.695,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"If there's something that this guy wants right now,

126
0:06:23.174,000 --> 0:06:25,000
it's to control the image of himself.

127
0:06:26.76,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Let's see if we can distort that.

128
0:06:29.49,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did

129
0:06:33.491,000 --> 0:06:36,000
through insulting him in his search results."

130
0:06:36.832,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And how?

131
0:06:38.797,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He told all of his readers the following,

132
0:06:40.877,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"Go out there on the Internet,

133
0:06:42.765,000 --> 0:06:44,000
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

134
0:06:46.708,000 --> 0:06:48,000
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

135
0:06:48.906,000 --> 0:06:51,000
publish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs.

136
0:06:52.4,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption,

137
0:06:55.345,000 --> 0:06:59,000
make sure to name the picture file "Breivik.jpeg."

138
0:06:59.856,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist."

139
0:07:05.552,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And it worked.

140
0:07:07.853,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama,

141
0:07:10.775,000 --> 0:07:13,000
this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked.

142
0:07:14.065,000 --> 0:07:18,000
If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden,

143
0:07:18.551,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results,

144
0:07:22.902,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as a little protest.

145
0:07:25.425,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Strangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time.

146
0:07:30.494,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They did not step in and manually clean those search results up.

147
0:07:35.964,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So the million-dollar question,

148
0:07:37.704,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is there anything different between these two happenings here?

149
0:07:41.096,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama

150
0:07:44.313,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik?

151
0:07:46.402,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Of course not.

152
0:07:48.861,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's the exact same thing,

153
0:07:50.356,000 --> 0:07:52,000
yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other.

154
0:07:53.244,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Why?

155
0:07:55.283,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person, that's why,

156
0:07:58.607,000 --> 0:08:,000
and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person.

157
0:08:02.142,000 --> 0:08:03,000
See what happens there?

158
0:08:03.701,000 --> 0:08:06,000
An evaluation of a person takes place

159
0:08:06.98,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and there's only one power-player in the world

160
0:08:10.79,000 --> 0:08:12,000
with the authority to say who's who.

161
0:08:13.882,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"We like you, we dislike you.

162
0:08:15.647,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We believe in you, we don't believe in you.

163
0:08:17.71,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You're right, you're wrong. You're true, you're false.

164
0:08:20.281,000 --> 0:08:21,000
You're Obama, and you're Breivik."

165
0:08:22.791,000 --> 0:08:24,000
That's power if I ever saw it.

166
0:08:27.206,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm

167
0:08:30.882,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is always a person,

168
0:08:32.683,000 --> 0:08:34,000
a person with a set of personal beliefs

169
0:08:35.202,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that no code can ever completely eradicate.

170
0:08:37.751,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And my message goes out not only to Google,

171
0:08:40.209,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but to all believers in the faith of code around the world.

172
0:08:43.043,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You need to identify your own personal bias.

173
0:08:46.043,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You need to understand that you are human

174
0:08:48.08,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and take responsibility accordingly.

175
0:08:51.891,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time

176
0:08:54.853,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when it's absolutely imperative

177
0:08:56.432,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that we tie those bonds together again, tighter:

178
0:08:59.673,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the humanities and the technology.

179
0:09:02.483,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Tighter than ever.

180
0:09:04.312,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea

181
0:09:07.675,000 --> 0:09:09,000
of the unbiased, clean search result

182
0:09:10.367,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is, and is likely to remain, a myth.

183
0:09:13.984,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Thank you for your time.

184
0:09:15.167,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause)

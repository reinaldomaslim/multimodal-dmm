1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She said, "Be good to your friends.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is one of her songs.

10
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Give him a big old hand.

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
One, two, three, four.

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Music)

16
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;

17
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
if I don't see her, I go crazy.

18
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
My true love lives up the river;

19
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a few more jumps and I'll be with her.

20
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

21
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.

23
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.

24
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.

25
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I'd pull her out on the front porch.

26
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.

27
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
A double outhouse over here on the side.

28
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,

29
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."

30
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

31
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

32
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Well, she and I went blackberry picking.

33
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
She got mad; I took a licking.

34
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,

35
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.

36
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

37
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

38
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Let's have the banjo.

39
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.

40
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I'll lay around; she'll make a living.

41
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;

42
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we'll have chicken someday, maybe.

43
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!

44
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
One more time now.

45
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

46
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

47
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Applause)

48
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Thank you, Michael.

49
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This is Ralph Stanley.

50
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
When I was going to college at University of California

51
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,

52
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.

53
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This was in 1968, I guess it was.

54
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And he played his bluegrass style of music,

55
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking

56
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that came from Africa, along with the banjo.

57
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.

58
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I fell in love with that.

59
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?

60
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,

61
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --

62
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
some place that has a lot of music.

63
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.

64
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So I went back that very summer.

65
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I just fell in love with the culture and the people.

66
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees

67
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.

68
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You can imagine how excited they were.

69
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures

70
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I've taken of some of my mentors.

71
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.

72
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.

73
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Music)

74
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

75
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.

76
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.

77
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,

78
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.

79
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.

80
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.

81
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And you can look at more pictures.

82
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done

83
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.

84
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.

85
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,

86
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and still played in the Southern mountains.

87
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.

88
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.

89
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.

90
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It sounds something like this.

91
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Music)

92
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy

93
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?

94
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

95
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

96
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army,

97
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they were known both far and wide.

98
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.

99
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

100
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

101
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Ain't that a sound?

102
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

103
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Well, it was 1954, I guess it was.

104
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,

105
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where I grew up in the early part of my life.

106
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.

107
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.

108
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.

109
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.

110
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,

111
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine

112
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.

113
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And, buddy, that made us mad.

114
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,

115
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.

116
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.

117
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.

118
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."

119
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car."

120
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
My brother and I stepped out of the car.

121
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.

122
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.

123
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.

124
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
She went up to the foreman; she said,

125
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."

126
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Of course, we were just eight and 10.

127
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

128
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
She said, "Would you put them to work?"

129
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:

130
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field

131
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in August in Texas -- it's hot.

132
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So he gave us each a cotton sack,

133
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.

134
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.

135
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And if you don't know what you're doing,

136
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
your hands are bleeding in no time.

137
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And my brother and I started to pick it,

138
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!"

139
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.

140
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
She wasn't going to give up.

141
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.

142
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.

143
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

144
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Don't want it to leave me behind.

145
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

146
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Don't want it to leave me behind."

147
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:

148
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

149
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

150
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

151
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And I don't want it to leave me behind."

152
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that

153
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.

154
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,

155
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
without crying, while they sang things like:

156
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"

157
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and "I done done," "This little light of mine."

158
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Finally, by the end of the day,

159
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.

160
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,

161
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but my mother would never let us cash it.

162
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I'm 57; still have the check.

163
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.

164
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.

165
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
No, we learned something else.

166
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The first thing I learned that day

167
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.

168
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Laughter)

169
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And pretty much never did.

170
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But I also learned that some people in this world

171
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.

172
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.

173
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.

174
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day

175
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.

176
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.

177
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But that day in the cotton field out there picking,

178
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
when those people started singing,

179
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I realized I was in the very heart of real music,

180
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.

181
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Try this old song with me. I sing:

182
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

183
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.

184
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

185
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Don't want it to leave me behind.

186
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

187
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

188
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

189
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I don't want it to leave me --

190
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?

191
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Let's try it one more time.

192
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

193
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Don't want it to leave me behind.

194
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

195
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Don't want it to leave me behind.

196
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

197
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

198
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

199
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

200
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,

201
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and I told it at a concert.

202
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
My mom was in the audience.

203
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,

204
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but after the concert she came up and she said,

205
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
"David, I've got to tell you something.

206
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I set that whole thing up.

207
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.

208
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.

209
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."

210
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.

211
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

212
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Good news: Chariot's coming.

213
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

214
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

215
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.

216
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,

217
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument

218
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.

219
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It's usually played flat on your lap.

220
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,

221
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.

222
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,

223
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.

224
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.

225
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.

226
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This instrument pretty much saved my life.

227
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,

228
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,

229
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.

230
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was

231
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
by going through such unbelievable grief,

232
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.

233
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.

234
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;

235
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I was ready to check out of this world.

236
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And you know, at the top of the list, of course,

237
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.

238
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But then, when I thought about it beyond that,

239
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
it was very simple things.

240
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,

241
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"

242
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.

243
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Nothing. Nothing.

244
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
On the list it would be stuff like,

245
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,

246
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,

247
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,

248
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.

249
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,

250
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.

251
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,

252
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.

253
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,

254
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that would really make that connection.

255
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
This is a song that came out of that.

256
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
(Music)

257
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Well, I hear you're having trouble.

258
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Lord, I hate to hear that news.

259
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.

260
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.

261
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.

262
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
People say, "Oh, snap out of it!"

263
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.

264
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.

265
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood

266
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.

267
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Now, you can try to keep it all inside

268
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
with drink and drugs and cigarettes,

269
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.

270
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.

271
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.

272
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Open up now.

273
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

274
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.

275
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.

276
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And he was working on gyroscopes;

277
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.

278
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.

279
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
They were about my age.

280
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
John went on, and Michael did too,

281
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
to become some of the inventors of computer animation.

282
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.

283
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;

284
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,

285
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
you know, what they were making. It was like a library,

286
0:19:45.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,

287
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
just floors and floors of these things,

288
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and one of the engineers said,

289
0:19:52.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.

290
0:19:56.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!

291
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:01,000
(Laughter)

292
0:20:01.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this --

293
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.

294
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.

295
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,

296
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:18,000
the inventor of the cotton gin.

297
0:20:18.33,000 --> 0:20:2,000
So we looked in that --

298
0:20:20.33,000 --> 0:20:22,000
this was a commercial chemistry set.

299
0:20:22.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:

300
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.

301
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.

302
0:20:30.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway

303
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.

304
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.

305
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
So we went over into Michael's garage --

306
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,

307
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,

308
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,

309
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,

310
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:58,000
and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder

311
0:20:58.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.

312
0:21:03.33,000 --> 0:21:04,000
(Laughter)

313
0:21:04.33,000 --> 0:21:08,000
We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.

314
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
We stood back, we lit that thing,

315
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.

316
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:17,000
Through the garage.

317
0:21:17.33,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.

318
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
(Laughter)

319
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.

320
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:32,000
That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.

321
0:21:32.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.

322
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.

323
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
They said they were going to beat us up

324
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:42,000
if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.

325
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:44,000
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?

326
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.

327
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:5,000
(Laughter)

328
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
Sure. We'll make you a big batch.

329
0:21:53.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
(Laughter)

330
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:58,000
So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --

331
0:21:58.33,000 --> 0:22:,000
now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.

332
0:22:00.33,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.

333
0:22:04.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.

334
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.

335
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.

336
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:16,000
No problem. Yeah, you know."

337
0:22:16.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.

338
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:23,000
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.

339
0:22:23.33,000 --> 0:22:26,000
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;

340
0:22:26.33,000 --> 0:22:28,000
the air was the just full of black smoke.

341
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:34,000
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.

342
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise

343
0:22:37.33,000 --> 0:22:4,000
it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.

344
0:22:41.33,000 --> 0:22:43,000
So I like to invent things too,

345
0:22:43.33,000 --> 0:22:48,000
and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.

346
0:22:48.33,000 --> 0:22:5,000
When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,

347
0:22:50.33,000 --> 0:22:54,000
why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,

348
0:22:54.33,000 --> 0:22:56,000
and combine it with the newest technology?

349
0:22:56.33,000 --> 0:22:58,000
I call this Thunderwear.

350
0:23:00.33,000 --> 0:23:02,000
At that time, drum triggers were new.

351
0:23:06.33,000 --> 0:23:11,000
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.

352
0:23:16.33,000 --> 0:23:18,000
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;

353
0:23:18.33,000 --> 0:23:2,000
I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.

354
0:23:20.33,000 --> 0:23:27,000
I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.

355
0:23:32.33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.

356
0:23:36.33,000 --> 0:23:43,000
Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,

357
0:23:43.33,000 --> 0:23:46,000
and they can make various sounds, like drums.

358
0:23:47.33,000 --> 0:23:5,000
So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds

359
0:23:50.33,000 --> 0:23:53,000
by stepping on this pedal right here, and --

360
0:23:55.33,000 --> 0:23:58,000
let me just close out here by doing you a little

361
0:23:58.33,000 --> 0:24:,000
hambone solo or something like this.

362
0:25:01.33,000 --> 0:25:03,000
Thank you, folks.

363
0:25:03.33,000 --> 0:25:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, this is about state budgets.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is probably the most boring topic

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of the whole morning.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that we need to care about.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
State budgets

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
are big, big money --

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'll show you the numbers --

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and they get very little scrutiny.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The understanding is very low.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Many of the people involved

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have special interests or short-term interests

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that get them not thinking

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about what the implications of the trends are.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And these budgets

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
are the key for our future;

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
they're the key for our kids.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Most education funding --

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
whether it's K through 12,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or the great universities or community colleges --

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
most of the money for those things

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is coming out of these state budgets.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But we have a problem.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Here's the overall picture.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
U.S. economy is big --

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
14.7 trillion.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now out of that pie,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the government spends 36 percent.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So this is combining the federal level,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is the largest,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the state level and the local level.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it's really in this combined way

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that you get an overall sense of what's going on,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because there's a lot of complex things

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like Medicaid and research money

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that flow across those boundaries.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But we're spending 36 percent.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Well what are we taking in?

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Simple business question.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Answer is 26 percent.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
sort of a mind-blowing number.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that we've had an economic recession.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Receipts go down,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
some spending programs go up,

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but most of it is not because of that.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Most of it is because of ways

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that the liabilities are building up

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the trends,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and that creates a huge challenge.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In fact, this is the forecast picture.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There are various things in here:

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I could say we might raise more revenue,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It is an increasingly difficult picture,

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
even assuming the economy does quite well --

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
probably better than it will do.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is what you see

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
at this overall level.

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now how did we get here?

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
How could you have a problem like this?

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
After all, at least on paper,

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Only one state says

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they don't have to balance the budget.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
But what this means actually

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is that there's a pretense.

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There's no real, true balancing going on,

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and in a sense, the games they play to hide that

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
actually obscure the topic so much

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that people don't see things

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
When Jerry Brown was elected,

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
this was the challenge that was put to him.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That is, through various gimmicks and things,

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a so-called balanced budget

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
had led him to have 25 billion missing

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
out of the 76 billion in proposed spending.

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now he's put together some thoughts:

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
About half of that he'll cut,

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
another half,

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
perhaps in a very complex set of steps,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
taxes will be approved.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But even so,

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as you go out into those future years,

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
various pension costs, health costs go up enough,

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the revenue does not go up enough.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So you get a big squeeze.

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What were those things that allowed us to hide this?

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, some really nice little tricks.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And these were somewhat noticed.

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The paper said, "It's not really balanced.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's got holes.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It perpetuates deficit spending.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's riddled with gimmicks."

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And really when you get down to it,

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the guys at Enron never would have done this.

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is so blatant,

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so extreme.

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Is anyone paying attention

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to some of the things these guys do?

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They borrow money.

104
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.

105
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They make you pay more in withholding

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
just to help their cash flow out.

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They sell off the assets.

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They defer the payments.

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They sell off the revenues from tobacco.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And California's not unique.

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In fact, there's about five states that are worse

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and only really four states

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that don't face this big challenge.

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So it's systemic across the entire country.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It really comes from the fact

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that certain long-term obligations --

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and just generosity --

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that these mis-accounting things

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
allow to develop over time,

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that you've got a problem.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is the retiree health care benefits.

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
much worse than the car companies.

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And everybody looked at that

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The forecast for the medical piece alone

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is to go from 26 percent of the budget

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to 42 percent.

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well what's going to give?

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well in order to accommodate that,

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you would have to cut education spending in half.

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It really is this young versus the old

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to some degree.

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
If you don't change that revenue picture,

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
if you don't solve what you're doing in health care,

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
you're going to be deinvesting in the young.

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The great University of California university system,

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the great things that have gone on,

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
won't happen.

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So far it's meant layoffs,

143
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
increased class sizes.

144
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Within the education community there's this discussion of,

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or the less good teachers who get laid off?"

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,

148
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
where do you do that? How much effect does that have?

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
well maybe you think that's okay.

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
There's ways, if it's temporary,

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to minimize the impact,

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but it's a problem.

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's also really a problem for where we need to go.

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Technology has a role to play.

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Well we need money to experiment with that,

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to get those tools in there.

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
measuring them, giving them feedback,

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
taking videos in the classroom.

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's something I think is very, very important.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Well you have to allocate dollars

164
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for that system

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and for that incentive pay.

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In a situation where you have growth,

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you put the new money into this.

168
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But with the type of cuts we're talking about,

170
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it will be far, far harder

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to get these incentives for excellence,

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or to move over

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to use technology in the new way.

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So what's going on?

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Where's the brain trust

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that's in error here?

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well there really is no brain trust.

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

179
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Just look at this spending.

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
California will spend over 100 billion,

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Microsoft, 38,

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Google, about 19.

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
both inside Google and Microsoft

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
should they have spent on that?

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it really is quite phenomenal.

190
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Everybody has an opinion.

191
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There's great feedback.

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And the numbers are used to make decisions.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending --

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
particularly these long-term trends --

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you don't have that type of involvement

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
on a number that's more important

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in terms of equity, in terms of learning.

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So what do we need to do?

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We need better tools.

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We can get some things out on the Internet.

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I'm going to use my website

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to put up some things that will give the basic picture.

203
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We need lots more.

204
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There's a few good books,

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
one about school spending and where the money comes from --

206
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
how that's changed over time, and the challenge.

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We need better accounting.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We need to take the fact

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that the current employees, the future liabilities they create,

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that should come out of the current budget.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the way they have.

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It should be more like private accounting.

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's the gold standard.

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And finally, we need to really reward politicians.

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems,

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We just shot you."

219
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In fact, there are some like these:

220
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who have gone through and given proposals

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.

223
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.

224
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In fact, the week afterwards,

225
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
some tax cuts were done

226
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that made the situation even worse

227
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
than their assumptions.

228
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So we need these pieces.

229
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Now I think this is a solvable problem.

230
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's a great country with lots of people.

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But we have to draw those people in,

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because this is about education.

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And just look at what happened with the tuitions

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
with the University of California

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and project that out for another three, four, five years --

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
it's unaffordable.

237
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And that's the kind of thing --

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the investment in the young --

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that makes us great, allows us to contribute.

240
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It allows us to do the art,

241
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the biotechnology, the software

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and all those magic things.

243
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And so the bottom line is

244
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we need to care about state budgets

245
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because they're critical for our kids and our future.

246
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Thank you.

247
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

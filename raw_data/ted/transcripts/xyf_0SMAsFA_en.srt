1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to talk about

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
what we learn from conservatives.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so I want to confess to you

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that when I was a kid,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
indeed, I was a conservative.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a leader in the Teenage Republicans.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Indeed, I was the youngest member

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
of any delegation

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to be the Republican nominee for president.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, I know what you're thinking.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And indeed, this is just one of the examples

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of the junk that flows across the tubes

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in these Internets here.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Wikipedia reports that this guy,

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
at the Republican National Convention,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but it's just not true.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Perfect.

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Okay.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Finally, truth will be brought here.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That's it. Please save this.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Great, here we go.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives --

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the thing to think about is this:

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They go to church.

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And I'm not talking about the God thing.

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They go to church, by which I mean,

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they do lots of things for free for each other.

52
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They hold potluck dinners.

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They serve food to poor people.

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They share, they give,

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they give away for free.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And it's the very same people

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
leading Wall Street firms

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who, on Sundays, show up

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and share.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And not only food, right.

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
These very same people

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
are strong believers, in lots of contexts,

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in the limits on the markets.

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They are in many important places

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
against markets.

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But they're very keen that we don't

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
let money drop into that relationship,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
else it turns into something like this.

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They want to regulate us, those conservatives,

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Because they understand:

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There are places for the market

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and places where the market should not exist,

76
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
where we should be free

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to enjoy the fellowship of others.

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And the second great thing about conservatives:

80
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
they get ecology.

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century

82
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who taught us about

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.

84
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
They first taught us about ecology

85
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in the context of natural resources.

86
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then they began to teach us in the context of

87
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
innovation, economics.

88
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They understand, in that context,

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"free." They understand "free" is an important

90
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
essential part of the

91
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
cultural ecology as well.

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's the thing I want you to think about them.

93
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, I know

94
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you don't believe me, really, here.

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So here's exhibit number one.

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
a libertarian who works at the, for many people,

98
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"evil" Cato Institute.

99
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Okay, so Julian made this video.

100
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He's a terrible producer of videos,

101
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So here he is beginning.

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
remix culture seems to be evolving ...

105
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us

106
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
about these three videos.

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix

108
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
set to Lisztomania.

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Which, of course, spread virally.

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Hugely successful.

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Music)

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.

113
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They decided they wanted to do the same.

114
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Music)

115
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.

116
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.

117
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Music)

118
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian

119
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.

120
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Here's lesson number one.

121
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.

122
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They are acting in the sense that they're

123
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
emulating the original mashup.

124
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye

125
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and some experience with video editing.

126
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But this is also basically just a group of friends

127
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
having an authentic social moment

128
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and screwing around together.

129
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate

130
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party

131
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
with a group of good friends.

132
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
LL: Or ...

133
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at

134
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because here, remix isn't just about

135
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
an individual doing something alone in his basement;

136
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it becomes an act of social creativity.

137
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it's not just that it yields

138
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a different kind of product at the end,

139
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.

140
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
All of our normal social interactions

141
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
become a kind of invitation

142
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to this sort of collective expression.

143
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's our real social lives themselves

144
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that are transmuted into art.

145
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...

146
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
JS: One remix is about

147
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
individuals using our shared culture

148
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.

149
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Stage two, social remix,

150
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is really about using it to mediate

151
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
people's relationships to each other.

152
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
First, within each video,

153
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template

154
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for performing the social reality of each group.

155
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But there's also a dialogue between the videos,

156
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
where, once the basic structure is established,

157
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it becomes a kind of platform

158
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for articulating the similarities and differences

159
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
between the groups' social and physical worlds.

160
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
LL: And then, here's for me,

161
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the critical key to what

162
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Julian has to say ...

163
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about

164
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
how to incentivize the production

165
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of a certain kind of artistic commodity;

166
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it's about what level of control

167
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we're going to permit to be exercised

168
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
over our social realities --

169
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
social realities that are now inevitably

170
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
permeated by pop culture.

171
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I think it's important that we

172
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.

173
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
If we're only focused on how to maximize

174
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the supply of one,

175
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I think we risk suppressing

176
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this different and richer

177
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.

178
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
LL: Right. Bingo. Point.

179
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Freedom needs this opportunity

180
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to both have the commercial success

181
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of the great commercial works

182
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the opportunity

183
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to build this different kind of culture.

184
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And for that to happen, you need

185
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
ideas like fair use to be central and protected,

186
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to enable this kind of innovation,

187
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
as this libertarian tells us,

188
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
between these two creative cultures,

189
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
a commercial and a sharing culture.

190
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The point is they, he, here,

191
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
gets that culture.

192
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, my concern is, we Dems,

193
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
too often, not so much.

194
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
All right, take for example this great company.

195
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,

196
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.

197
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
All of the great Disney works

198
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
were works that took works that

199
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
were in the public domain and remixed them,

200
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,

201
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.

202
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,

203
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
as "Steamboat Willie,"

204
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is a remix of the then, very dominant,

205
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
very popular "Steamboat Bill"

206
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
by Buster Keaton.

207
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.

208
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
He is the celebration and ideal

209
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of exactly this kind of creativity.

210
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But then the company passes

211
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
through this dark stage

212
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to this Democrat.

213
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Wildly different.

214
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is the mastermind behind

215
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the eventual passage of what we call

216
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,

217
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
extending the term of existing copyrights

218
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by 20 years,

219
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
so that no one could do to Disney

220
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.

221
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now, when we tried to challenge this,

222
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --

223
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,

224
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners

225
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
including this right-wing

226
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,

227
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
who said he would join our brief

228
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
only if the word "no brainer"

229
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
was in the brief somewhere.

230
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But apparently, no brains

232
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
existed in this place

233
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
when Democrats passed and signed

234
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
this bill into law.

235
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:

236
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,

237
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but I don't buy it.

238
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This guy is no Republican.

239
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Okay, for a second example,

240
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
think about this cultural hero,

241
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
icon on the Left,

242
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
creator of this character.

243
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,

244
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
inviting people to come and use their creative energy

245
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to produce a new generation of attention

246
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.

247
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Read the license.

248
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The license for these remixers

249
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
assigns all of the rights

250
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to the remix back to Lucas.

251
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The mashup is owned by Lucas.

252
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,

253
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
music you might add,

254
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right

255
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to exploit that for free.

256
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There is no creator here to be recognized.

257
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The creator doesn't have any rights.

258
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.

259
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And we should remember

260
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who employed the sharecroppers:

261
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the Democrats, right?

262
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So the point is the Republicans here

263
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
recognize that there's a certain need

264
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of ownership,

265
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
a respect for ownership,

266
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the respect we should give the creator,

267
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the remixer, the owner, the property owner,

268
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the copyright owner

269
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,

270
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and not a generation of sharecroppers.

271
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,

272
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
lessons about openness.

273
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Our lives are sharing activities,

274
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
at least in part.

275
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,

276
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
at least in part.

277
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have

278
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
well-protected spaces of fair use.

279
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That's number one. Number two:

280
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This ecology of sharing

281
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
needs freedom

282
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
within which to create.

283
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,

284
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the ability to create.

285
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And number three: We need to

286
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
respect the creator,

287
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the creator of these remixes

288
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
through rights that are

289
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
directly tied to them.

290
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit

291
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Creative Commons.

292
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,

293
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but of course -- let me just tie it here --

294
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the Creative Commons, which is

295
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
offering authors this simple way to mark their content

296
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
with the freedoms

297
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
they intended to carry.

298
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world

299
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to a "some rights reserved" world

300
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,

301
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
building and creating

302
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
on the basis of this

303
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
creative copyrighted work.

304
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
These tools that we built

305
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
enable this sharing in parts

306
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
through licenses that make it clear

307
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and a freedom to create

308
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
without requiring permission first

309
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because the permission has already been granted

310
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and a respect for the creator because it builds upon

311
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a copyright the creator

312
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
has licensed freely.

313
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy

314
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that's obviously developed around these licenses,

315
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
as now more than 350 million digital objects

316
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
are out there, licensed freely

317
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in this way.

318
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,

319
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the picture of an ecology

320
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of balanced creativity,

321
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?

322
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Well, as you all know,

323
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
not many of us believe we do.

324
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity

325
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
just last week.

326
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I created a video which was based

327
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,

328
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I uploaded it to YouTube.

329
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I then got this email from YouTube

330
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
weirdly notifying me

331
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that there was content in that

332
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
owned by the mysterious WMG

333
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that matched their content ID.

334
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So I didn't think much about it.

335
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,

336
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"

337
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy

338
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.

339
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.

340
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
But then I went to the site

341
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.

342
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
My whole 45-minute video

343
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
had been silenced

344
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because there were snippets in that video,

345
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
a video about fair use,

346
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that included Warner Music Group music.

347
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Now, interestingly,

348
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
they still sold ads for that music,

349
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
if you played the silent video.

350
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
You could still buy the music,

351
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but you couldn't hear anything

352
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
because it had been silenced.

353
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So I did what the current regime

354
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
says I must do

355
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to be free to use

356
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
YouTube to talk about fair use.

357
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.

358
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And then in an extraordinarily

359
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way

360
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
you've actually got to type out these words

361
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and get them right

362
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to reassert your freedom to speak.

363
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I felt like I was in third grade again.

364
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.

365
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."

366
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
This is absurd.

367
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
It is outrageous.

368
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom

369
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
we should be encouraging.

370
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?

371
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,

372
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
who was the number one, active

373
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
opponent of this system of regulation

374
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in online speech?

375
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
John McCain.

376
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal

377
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to be more respectful of fair use

378
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
with their extraordinary notice and take down system,

379
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that led his campaign so many times

380
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
to be thrown off the Internet.

381
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Now, that was the story of me then,

382
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
my good old days of right-wing lunacy.

383
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Let me come back to now,

384
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
now when I'm a little leftist --

385
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --

386
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And I wonder, can we on the Left

387
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
expect to build this

388
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
ecology of freedom, now,

389
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
in a world where

390
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
we know the extraordinarily powerful

391
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
influences against it,

392
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
where even icons of the Left like this

393
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
entertain and push bills

394
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that would effectively ban the requirement

395
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
of open access for government-funded research?

396
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
The president, who has supported

397
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
a process that secretly negotiates agreements,

398
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
which effectively lock us into the insane system

399
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
of DMCA

400
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that we have adopted

401
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out

402
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.

403
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Not a single example of reform

404
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
has been produced yet.

405
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And we're not going to see this change

406
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
in this system

407
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
anytime soon.

408
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
So here's the lessons of openness

409
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that I think we need to learn.

410
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Openness is a commitment

411
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
to a certain set of values.

412
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
We need to speak of those values.

413
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.

414
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's a value of the limits in regulation.

415
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
It's a value respecting the creator.

416
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Now, if we can learn those values

417
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
from at least some influences on the Right,

418
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
if we can take them and incorporate them,

419
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
maybe we could do a little trade.

420
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
We learn those values on the Left,

421
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and maybe they'll do health care

422
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
or global warming legislation or something in the Right.

423
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Anyway, please join me

424
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
in teaching these values.

425
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Thank you very much.

426
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

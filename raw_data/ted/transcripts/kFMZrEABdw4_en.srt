1
0:00:16.918,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was here four years ago,

2
0:00:18.442,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I remember, at the time,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that the talks weren't put online.

4
0:00:23.803,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a box set of DVDs,

6
0:00:29.135,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which they put on their shelves, where they are now.

7
0:00:31.651,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.679,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said,

9
0:00:38.261,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?"

10
0:00:41.489,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I said, "Sure."

11
0:00:43.393,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And four years later,

12
0:00:45.996,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it's been downloaded four million times.

13
0:00:51.13,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something

14
0:00:53.996,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to get the number of people who've seen it.

15
0:00:56.068,000 --> 0:01:,000
And, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.

16
0:01:00.625,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:03.293,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:09.336,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Don't you feel?

19
0:01:10.362,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:15.117,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up

21
0:01:18.885,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to me doing another one for you, so here it is.

22
0:01:21.548,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:24.561,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago

24
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and talked about the climate crisis.

25
0:01:32.986,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk.

26
0:01:36.668,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So I want to pick up from there

27
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.

28
0:01:40.334,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:41.896,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, as I was saying --

30
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:52.551,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You see, he's right.

32
0:01:53.606,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously,

33
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.

34
0:01:59.38,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:03.088,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But I believe there is a second climate crisis,

36
0:02:06.627,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is as severe,

37
0:02:08.826,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which has the same origins,

38
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.

39
0:02:15.294,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And you may say, by the way,

40
0:02:17.486,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"Look, I'm good.

41
0:02:19.194,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one."

42
0:02:22.684,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:23.725,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But this is a crisis of, not natural resources --

44
0:02:26.122,000 --> 0:02:27,000
though I believe that's true --

45
0:02:28.068,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but a crisis of human resources.

46
0:02:30.903,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I believe fundamentally,

47
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
as many speakers have said during the past few days,

48
0:02:35.054,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that we make very poor use of our talents.

49
0:02:40.164,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Very many people go through their whole lives

50
0:02:42.284,000 --> 0:02:44,000
having no real sense of what their talents may be,

51
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or if they have any to speak of.

52
0:02:48.029,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I meet all kinds of people

53
0:02:49.394,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who don't think they're really good at anything.

54
0:02:52.513,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.

55
0:02:56.409,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher,

56
0:02:59.837,000 --> 0:03:,000
once spiked this argument.

57
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
He said, "There are two types of people in this world:

58
0:03:03.948,000 --> 0:03:04,000
those who divide the world into two types

59
0:03:05.932,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and those who do not."

60
0:03:07.132,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:12.94,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Well, I do.

62
0:03:14.013,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:19.742,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.

64
0:03:24.726,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They simply go through their lives getting on with it.

65
0:03:27.973,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They get no great pleasure from what they do.

66
0:03:30.426,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They endure it rather than enjoy it,

67
0:03:33.923,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and wait for the weekend.

68
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I also meet people

69
0:03:38.179,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

70
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
If you said, "Don't do this anymore,"

71
0:03:44.091,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they'd wonder what you're talking about.

72
0:03:46.112,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It isn't what they do, it's who they are.

73
0:03:48.212,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They say, "But this is me, you know.

74
0:03:50.177,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It would be foolish to abandon this,

75
0:03:52.106,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because it speaks to my most authentic self."

76
0:03:54.713,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And it's not true of enough people.

77
0:03:57.847,000 --> 0:04:,000
In fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.

78
0:04:01.919,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I think there are many possible explanations for it.

79
0:04:05.71,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And high among them is education,

80
0:04:09.671,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because education, in a way,

81
0:04:12.069,000 --> 0:04:15,000
dislocates very many people from their natural talents.

82
0:04:16.132,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And human resources are like natural resources;

83
0:04:19.029,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they're often buried deep.

84
0:04:20.989,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You have to go looking for them,

85
0:04:22.555,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they're not just lying around on the surface.

86
0:04:24.746,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.

87
0:04:27.974,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens,

88
0:04:31.498,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but too often, it's not.

89
0:04:33.815,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment

90
0:04:37.597,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it's not enough.

91
0:04:39.306,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Reform is no use anymore,

92
0:04:42.028,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because that's simply improving a broken model.

93
0:04:45.393,000 --> 0:04:46,000
What we need --

94
0:04:46.464,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the word's been used many times in the past few days --

95
0:04:49.257,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is not evolution,

96
0:04:51.035,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but a revolution in education.

97
0:04:54.027,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This has to be transformed into something else.

98
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education.

100
0:05:09.366,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Innovation is hard,

101
0:05:11.501,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because it means doing something that people don't find very easy,

102
0:05:14.721,000 --> 0:05:15,000
for the most part.

103
0:05:16.107,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It means challenging what we take for granted,

104
0:05:18.539,000 --> 0:05:19,000
things that we think are obvious.

105
0:05:21.155,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The great problem for reform or transformation

106
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is the tyranny of common sense.

107
0:05:28.11,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Things that people think,

108
0:05:29.478,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"It can't be done differently, that's how it's done."

109
0:05:32.031,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln,

110
0:05:34.872,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.

111
0:05:37.737,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:39.506,000 --> 0:05:45,000
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress.

113
0:05:46.458,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.

114
0:05:51.212,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We don't teach American history in Britain.

115
0:05:53.989,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:55.926,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We suppress it. You know, this is our policy.

117
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:01.397,000 --> 0:06:03,000
No doubt, something fascinating was happening then,

119
0:06:03.992,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which the Americans among us will be aware of.

120
0:06:08.607,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But he said this:

121
0:06:10.916,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.

122
0:06:18.021,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The occasion is piled high with difficulty,

123
0:06:21.863,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and we must rise with the occasion."

124
0:06:25.812,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I love that.

125
0:06:26.867,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Not rise to it, rise with it.

126
0:06:30.463,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"As our case is new,

127
0:06:32.476,000 --> 0:06:37,000
so we must think anew and act anew.

128
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We must disenthrall ourselves,

129
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and then we shall save our country."

130
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I love that word, "disenthrall."

131
0:06:46.971,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You know what it means?

132
0:06:48.1,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to,

133
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things,

134
0:06:54.317,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the way things are.

135
0:06:55.713,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And many of our ideas have been formed,

136
0:06:58.387,000 --> 0:07:,000
not to meet the circumstances of this century,

137
0:07:00.649,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.

138
0:07:03.34,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But our minds are still hypnotized by them,

139
0:07:05.537,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.

140
0:07:08.783,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, doing this is easier said than done.

141
0:07:11.212,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.

142
0:07:14.949,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the reason is that you take it for granted.

143
0:07:17.268,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:18.294,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Let me ask you something you may take for granted.

145
0:07:20.652,000 --> 0:07:22,000
How many of you here are over the age of 25?

146
0:07:23.88,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That's not what you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that.

147
0:07:27.95,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Are there any people here under the age of 25?

148
0:07:31.03,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Great. Now, those over 25,

149
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch?

150
0:07:37.055,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?

151
0:07:39.84,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing.

152
0:07:42.832,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.

153
0:07:44.919,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I don't mean they can't,

154
0:07:46.857,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they just often choose not to.

155
0:07:48.705,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture,

156
0:07:52.325,000 --> 0:07:53,000
those of us over 25.

157
0:07:53.56,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And so for us, if you want to know the time,

158
0:07:55.733,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you have to wear something to tell it.

159
0:07:57.703,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Kids now live in a world which is digitized,

160
0:08:00.426,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and the time, for them, is everywhere.

161
0:08:02.537,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They see no reason to do this.

162
0:08:04.406,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And by the way, you don't need either;

163
0:08:06.275,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.

164
0:08:09.268,000 --> 0:08:12,000
My daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.

165
0:08:12.537,000 --> 0:08:13,000
She doesn't see the point.

166
0:08:13.954,000 --> 0:08:14,000
As she says,

167
0:08:15.765,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"It's a single-function device."

168
0:08:17.66,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:22.812,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"Like, how lame is that?"

170
0:08:25.156,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."

171
0:08:27.42,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"It has multiple functions."

173
0:08:33.887,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.

175
0:08:39.293,000 --> 0:08:4,000
A couple of examples.

176
0:08:40.672,000 --> 0:08:42,000
One of them is the idea of linearity:

177
0:08:43.419,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that it starts here and you go through a track

178
0:08:46.079,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and if you do everything right,

179
0:08:47.626,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you will end up set for the rest of your life.

180
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly,

181
0:08:54.808,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or sometimes explicitly, a different story:

182
0:08:57.508,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that life is not linear; it's organic.

183
0:09:00.738,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We create our lives symbiotically

184
0:09:02.754,000 --> 0:09:03,000
as we explore our talents

185
0:09:04.627,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.

186
0:09:07.856,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.

187
0:09:11.57,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college.

188
0:09:15.476,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college.

189
0:09:18.682,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Certain sorts of college.

190
0:09:19.985,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I don't mean you shouldn't go, but not everybody needs to go,

191
0:09:22.913,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or go now.

192
0:09:24.13,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Maybe they go later, not right away.

193
0:09:26.786,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing.

194
0:09:29.938,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.

195
0:09:32.761,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I said, "What do you do?"

196
0:09:34.055,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And he said, "I'm a fireman."

197
0:09:37.141,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I asked, "How long have you been a fireman?"

198
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"Always. I've always been a fireman."

199
0:09:42.21,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid.

200
0:09:44.591,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Actually, it was a problem for me at school,

201
0:09:46.711,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."

202
0:09:49.261,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:50.299,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."

204
0:09:53.012,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And he said, "When I got to the senior year of school,

205
0:09:55.825,000 --> 0:09:57,000
my teachers didn't take it seriously.

206
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.

207
0:10:00.536,000 --> 0:10:02,000
He said I was throwing my life away

208
0:10:02.607,000 --> 0:10:04,000
if that's all I chose to do with it;

209
0:10:04.647,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that I should go to college, I should become a professional person,

210
0:10:07.977,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that I had great potential

211
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I was wasting my talent to do that."

212
0:10:11.414,000 --> 0:10:12,000
He said, "It was humiliating.

213
0:10:12.852,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful.

214
0:10:15.462,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But it's what I wanted, and as soon as I left school,

215
0:10:17.993,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I applied to the fire service and I was accepted.

216
0:10:20.315,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You know, I was thinking about that guy recently,

217
0:10:22.625,000 --> 0:10:25,000
just a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher,

218
0:10:25.84,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because six months ago, I saved his life."

219
0:10:29.093,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:32.329,000 --> 0:10:36,000
He said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,

221
0:10:36.712,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I saved his wife's life as well."

222
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He said, "I think he thinks better of me now."

223
0:10:41.475,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

225
0:10:49.792,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You know, to me,

226
0:10:51.015,000 --> 0:10:55,000
human communities depend upon a diversity of talent,

227
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
not a singular conception of ability.

228
0:10:58.188,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And at the heart of our challenges --

229
0:11:00.189,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

230
0:11:02.854,000 --> 0:11:03,000
At the heart of the challenge

231
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.

232
0:11:08.59,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This linearity thing is a problem.

233
0:11:11.414,000 --> 0:11:13,000
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago,

234
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I came across a policy statement --

235
0:11:18.413,000 --> 0:11:19,000
very well-intentioned --

236
0:11:19.7,000 --> 0:11:21,000
which said, "College begins in kindergarten."

237
0:11:24.124,000 --> 0:11:25,000
No, it doesn't.

238
0:11:25.338,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:29.831,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It doesn't.

240
0:11:31.633,000 --> 0:11:33,000
If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.

241
0:11:34.11,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:36.348,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.

243
0:11:38.848,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:41.182,000 --> 0:11:42,000
A friend of mine once said,

245
0:11:42.959,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"A three year-old is not half a six year-old."

246
0:11:45.42,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

248
0:11:52.813,000 --> 0:11:53,000
They're three.

249
0:11:53.949,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But as we just heard in this last session,

250
0:11:55.973,000 --> 0:11:58,000
there's such competition now to get into kindergarten --

251
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
to get to the right kindergarten --

252
0:12:01.143,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that people are being interviewed for it at three.

253
0:12:07.099,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels,

254
0:12:09.197,000 --> 0:12:1,000
you know, with their resumes --

255
0:12:10.698,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:13.313,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Flicking through and saying, "What, this is it?"

257
0:12:15.611,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

258
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

259
0:12:20.603,000 --> 0:12:22,000
"You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?"

260
0:12:23.583,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:30.66,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.

262
0:12:32.438,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

263
0:12:33.848,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Spent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see."

264
0:12:36.673,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

265
0:12:41.792,000 --> 0:12:43,000
See, it's outrageous as a conception.

266
0:12:44.403,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The other big issue is conformity.

267
0:12:46.617,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food.

268
0:12:50.875,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.

269
0:12:53.772,000 --> 0:12:55,000
There are two models of quality assurance in catering.

270
0:12:56.343,000 --> 0:12:58,000
One is fast food, where everything is standardized.

271
0:12:59.007,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants,

272
0:13:01.346,000 --> 0:13:02,000
where everything is not standardized,

273
0:13:03.133,000 --> 0:13:05,000
they're customized to local circumstances.

274
0:13:05.182,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education,

275
0:13:08.583,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies

276
0:13:11.682,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.

277
0:13:15.069,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

278
0:13:21.149,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We have to recognize a couple of things here.

279
0:13:23.288,000 --> 0:13:25,000
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse.

280
0:13:25.66,000 --> 0:13:26,000
People have very different aptitudes.

281
0:13:27.487,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid

282
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.

283
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Laughter)

284
0:13:35.888,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying.

285
0:13:38.144,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Laughter)

286
0:13:39.19,000 --> 0:13:4,000
In a way --

287
0:13:41.405,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it did not for me.

288
0:13:42.696,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I could not get this thing to work

289
0:13:45.261,000 --> 0:13:47,000
no matter how often or how hard I blew into it.

290
0:13:47.817,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It just wouldn't work.

291
0:13:49.548,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Laughter)

292
0:13:53.158,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But it's not only about that.

293
0:13:54.563,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It's about passion.

294
0:13:56.411,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Often, people are good at things they don't really care for.

295
0:13:59.342,000 --> 0:14:,000
It's about passion,

296
0:14:00.56,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and what excites our spirit and our energy.

297
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,

298
0:14:06.665,000 --> 0:14:08,000
time takes a different course entirely.

299
0:14:09.38,000 --> 0:14:11,000
My wife's just finished writing a novel,

300
0:14:11.581,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and I think it's a great book,

301
0:14:14.636,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but she disappears for hours on end.

302
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You know this, if you're doing something you love,

303
0:14:19.665,000 --> 0:14:2,000
an hour feels like five minutes.

304
0:14:22.203,000 --> 0:14:25,000
If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit,

305
0:14:25.275,000 --> 0:14:26,000
five minutes feels like an hour.

306
0:14:26.89,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And the reason so many people are opting out of education

307
0:14:29.598,000 --> 0:14:31,000
is because it doesn't feed their spirit,

308
0:14:31.939,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it doesn't feed their energy or their passion.

309
0:14:35.034,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So I think we have to change metaphors.

310
0:14:37.563,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education,

311
0:14:41.118,000 --> 0:14:42,000
a manufacturing model,

312
0:14:42.943,000 --> 0:14:46,000
which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.

313
0:14:47.728,000 --> 0:14:48,000
We have to move to a model

314
0:14:49.657,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that is based more on principles of agriculture.

315
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We have to recognize

316
0:14:53.547,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that human flourishing is not a mechanical process;

317
0:14:57.498,000 --> 0:14:58,000
it's an organic process.

318
0:14:59.451,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development.

319
0:15:03.061,000 --> 0:15:05,000
All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions

320
0:15:05.778,000 --> 0:15:07,000
under which they will begin to flourish.

321
0:15:08.539,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it,

322
0:15:11.824,000 --> 0:15:13,000
it isn't like cloning a system.

323
0:15:14.106,000 --> 0:15:16,000
There are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.

324
0:15:16.702,000 --> 0:15:17,000
There are many great models.

325
0:15:18.565,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It's about customizing to your circumstances

326
0:15:21.811,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching.

327
0:15:25.888,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And doing that, I think, is the answer to the future

328
0:15:28.985,000 --> 0:15:31,000
because it's not about scaling a new solution;

329
0:15:32.424,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's about creating a movement in education

330
0:15:34.765,000 --> 0:15:36,000
in which people develop their own solutions,

331
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but with external support based on a personalized curriculum.

332
0:15:40.569,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Now in this room,

333
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business,

334
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in multimedia, in the Internet.

335
0:15:48.576,000 --> 0:15:49,000
These technologies,

336
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers,

337
0:15:53.05,000 --> 0:15:56,000
provide an opportunity to revolutionize education.

338
0:15:56.927,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And I urge you to get involved in it

339
0:15:59.046,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children.

340
0:16:02.69,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But we have to change from the industrial model

341
0:16:05.117,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to an agricultural model,

342
0:16:06.792,000 --> 0:16:09,000
where each school can be flourishing tomorrow.

343
0:16:09.84,000 --> 0:16:1,000
That's where children experience life.

344
0:16:11.712,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Or at home, if that's what they choose,

345
0:16:13.602,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to be educated with their families or friends.

346
0:16:15.839,000 --> 0:16:19,000
There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days.

347
0:16:20.474,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And I wanted to just very quickly --

348
0:16:22.524,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,

349
0:16:25.453,000 --> 0:16:26,000
recovering old poems.

350
0:16:27.468,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem

351
0:16:29.628,000 --> 0:16:31,000
from W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know.

352
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,

353
0:16:36.153,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and he was bewailing the fact

354
0:16:39.058,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.

355
0:16:42.332,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."

356
0:16:45.752,000 --> 0:16:46,000
He says this:

357
0:16:47.768,000 --> 0:16:49,000
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,

358
0:16:50.664,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Enwrought with gold and silver light,

359
0:16:54.632,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

360
0:16:58.093,000 --> 0:17:,000
Of night and light and the half-light,

361
0:17:02.162,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I would spread the cloths under your feet:

362
0:17:05.314,000 --> 0:17:08,000
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

363
0:17:10.156,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I have spread my dreams under your feet;

364
0:17:14.009,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Tread softly

365
0:17:15.661,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because you tread on my dreams."

366
0:17:18.117,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And every day, everywhere,

367
0:17:20.925,000 --> 0:17:23,000
our children spread their dreams beneath our feet.

368
0:17:24.94,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And we should tread softly.

369
0:17:27.449,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Thank you.

370
0:17:28.546,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

371
0:17:32.204,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Thank you very much.

372
0:17:33.607,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

373
0:17:37.649,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Thank you.

374
0:17:38.688,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Applause)

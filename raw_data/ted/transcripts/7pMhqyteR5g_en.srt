1
0:00:13.667,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I started life as a fashion designer,

2
0:00:17.253,000 --> 0:00:21,000
working closely with textile designers and fabric suppliers.

3
0:00:22.458,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But today, I can no longer see or talk to my new collaborators,

4
0:00:27.347,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because they're in the soil beneath our feet,

5
0:00:30.458,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on the shelves of our supermarkets

6
0:00:32.87,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and in the beer I'm going to drink when I finish this talk.

7
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm talking about microbes

8
0:00:40.323,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and designing with life.

9
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Fifteen years ago,

10
0:00:45.173,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I completely changed both what I worked with

11
0:00:48.403,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and how I worked

12
0:00:49.593,000 --> 0:00:52,000
after a revelatory collaboration with a biologist.

13
0:00:53.775,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Our project gave me a different perspective on life,

14
0:00:58.688,000 --> 0:01:01,000
introducing a whole new world of possibility

15
0:01:01.835,000 --> 0:01:04,000
around how we can design and make things.

16
0:01:05.561,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I discovered a radical manufacturing proposition:

17
0:01:10.323,000 --> 0:01:11,000
biofabrication.

18
0:01:12.172,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Literally, fabricating with biology.

19
0:01:17.212,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What does that mean?

20
0:01:18.656,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, instead of processing plants, animals or oil

21
0:01:23.895,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to make consumer materials,

22
0:01:26.371,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we might grow materials directly with living organisms.

23
0:01:32.618,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In what many are terming "the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"

24
0:01:36.658,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we're thinking about the new factories as being living cells.

25
0:01:41.568,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast:

26
0:01:45.528,000 --> 0:01:5,000
our latest design tools include those of biotechnology.

27
0:01:51.212,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My own journey in biofabrication

28
0:01:53.911,000 --> 0:01:55,000
started with a project called "Biocouture."

29
0:01:57.522,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The provocation was that instead of growing a plant, like cotton,

30
0:02:01.881,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a field over several months,

31
0:02:04.198,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we could use microbes to grow a similar cellulose material in a lab

32
0:02:10.505,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in a few days.

33
0:02:11.958,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient-rich liquid,

34
0:02:16.601,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we fermented threads of cellulose

35
0:02:20.006,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that self-organized into a sheet of fabric.

36
0:02:24.529,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I dried the fabric I had grown

37
0:02:27.498,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and cut and sewed it into a range of garments, shoes and bags.

38
0:02:33.134,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In other words, in one lab we grew materials

39
0:02:36.397,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and turned them into a range of products

40
0:02:38.785,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in a matter of days.

41
0:02:40.769,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And this is in contrast to currents methods of fabric production,

42
0:02:45.316,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where a plant is grown,

43
0:02:47.832,000 --> 0:02:5,000
just the cotton part is harvested,

44
0:02:50.951,000 --> 0:02:51,000
processed into a yarn,

45
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:53,000
woven into a fabric

46
0:02:54.553,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and then potentially shipped across oceans

47
0:02:57.331,000 --> 0:03:,000
before being cut and sewn into a garment.

48
0:03:00.506,000 --> 0:03:02,000
All of that can take months.

49
0:03:04.016,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So these prototypes indicated a field

50
0:03:07.136,000 --> 0:03:1,000
offering significant resource efficiencies.

51
0:03:10.572,000 --> 0:03:13,000
From reducing the water, energy and chemistry needed

52
0:03:14.561,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in the production of a material,

53
0:03:16.949,000 --> 0:03:19,000
through to generating zero waste,

54
0:03:20.363,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we grew fabrics to finished form --

55
0:03:23.95,000 --> 0:03:27,000
if you like, "biological additive manufacture."

56
0:03:29.307,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Through biofabrication,

57
0:03:31.998,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I had replaced many intensive man-made steps

58
0:03:36.323,000 --> 0:03:38,000
with one biological step.

59
0:03:39.433,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And as I engaged with this living system,

60
0:03:42.179,000 --> 0:03:44,000
it transformed my design thinking.

61
0:03:44.973,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Here was biology, with no intervention from me

62
0:03:49.258,000 --> 0:03:53,000
other than designing initial conditions for growth,

63
0:03:53.639,000 --> 0:03:57,000
efficiently producing a useful, sustainable material.

64
0:03:58.996,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So now I can't help but see all materials through the lens of biofabrication.

65
0:04:05.806,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In fact, there's a growing global community of innovators

66
0:04:11.324,000 --> 0:04:14,000
rethinking materials with biology.

67
0:04:15.498,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Multiple companies are now growing mushroom materials,

68
0:04:20.307,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but not literally mushrooms --

69
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
using mycelium, which is the root system of fungi,

70
0:04:27.395,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to bind together agricultural byproducts.

71
0:04:31.201,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's a process that's been described as "nature's glue."

72
0:04:35.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
A common way to do this is to take a 3-D mold,

73
0:04:39.379,000 --> 0:04:44,000
fill it with a waste crop like corn stalks or hemp,

74
0:04:44.855,000 --> 0:04:45,000
add water,

75
0:04:46.474,000 --> 0:04:5,000
wait a few days for the mycelium to grow throughout,

76
0:04:50.577,000 --> 0:04:51,000
remove the mold,

77
0:04:52.053,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and you're left with a grown 3-D form.

78
0:04:56.601,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Incredibly, we can grow all kinds of structures

79
0:05:00.292,000 --> 0:05:02,000
using living organisms,

80
0:05:02.712,000 --> 0:05:06,000
from foams that can replace plastics in footwear,

81
0:05:06.944,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to leather-like materials without animals.

82
0:05:09.857,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Furniture, flooring -- all are currently being prototyped.

83
0:05:13.754,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Fungi are able to grow materials that are naturally fire retardant,

84
0:05:19.496,000 --> 0:05:2,000
without any chemicals.

85
0:05:21.638,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They're naturally hydrophobic,

86
0:05:23.392,000 --> 0:05:25,000
meaning they won't absorb water.

87
0:05:25.646,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They have higher melt temperatures than plastics.

88
0:05:30.357,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Polystyrene can take thousands of years to degrade.

89
0:05:35.722,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Mushroom packaging materials

90
0:05:38.276,000 --> 0:05:41,000
can be naturally composted in your back garden

91
0:05:41.974,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in as little as 30 days.

92
0:05:45.442,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Living organisms are transforming waste

93
0:05:48.411,000 --> 0:05:52,000
into cost-competitive, performance-matching materials

94
0:05:52.903,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that can start to replace plastics

95
0:05:55.191,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and other CO2-emitting materials.

96
0:05:58.924,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And once we start growing materials with living organisms,

97
0:06:02.567,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it starts to make previous methods of manufacture seem illogical.

98
0:06:09.3,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Take the humble house brick.

99
0:06:13.007,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The cement industry generates around eight percent

100
0:06:16.077,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of global CO2 emissions.

101
0:06:17.966,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That's more than all the planes and ships each year.

102
0:06:21.958,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The cement process requires materials to be fired in a kiln

103
0:06:27.311,000 --> 0:06:3,000
at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

104
0:06:31.504,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Compare this to bioMASON.

105
0:06:35.195,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They use a soil microbe to transform loose aggregates,

106
0:06:39.791,000 --> 0:06:41,000
like sand or crushed stone,

107
0:06:42.433,000 --> 0:06:46,000
into a biofabricated, or biocement, brick.

108
0:06:47.028,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Their process happens at room temperature,

109
0:06:50.806,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in just a couple of days.

110
0:06:52.861,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Think: hydroponics for bricks.

111
0:06:55.789,000 --> 0:06:59,000
An irrigation system feeds nutrient-rich water

112
0:07:00.763,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to trays of bricks

113
0:07:02.684,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that have been inoculated with bacteria.

114
0:07:05.926,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The bacteria produce crystals

115
0:07:08.284,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that form around each grain of sand,

116
0:07:11.37,000 --> 0:07:14,000
locking together all the loose particles

117
0:07:14.577,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to form a solid brick.

118
0:07:17.725,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We can now grow construction materials

119
0:07:21.098,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in the elegant way nature does,

120
0:07:23.637,000 --> 0:07:25,000
just like a coral reef.

121
0:07:26.831,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And these biofabricated bricks are nearly three times stronger

122
0:07:32.458,000 --> 0:07:34,000
than a concrete block.

123
0:07:35.702,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And in stark contrast to traditional cement production,

124
0:07:39.821,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they store more carbon than they make.

125
0:07:43.202,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So if we could replace the 1.2 trillion fired bricks

126
0:07:47.932,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that are made each year

127
0:07:49.631,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with biofabricated bricks,

128
0:07:52.321,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we could reduce CO2 emissions

129
0:07:54.958,000 --> 0:07:57,000
by 800 million tons every year.

130
0:08:00.307,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:08.034,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Beyond growing materials with living organisms,

132
0:08:11.557,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we're even starting to design products

133
0:08:13.962,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that encourage their growth.

134
0:08:16.338,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And this comes from the realization

135
0:08:18.711,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that the very thing we've been trying to marginalize -- life --

136
0:08:24.235,000 --> 0:08:27,000
might actually be our greatest collaborator.

137
0:08:28.689,000 --> 0:08:31,000
To that end, we've been exploring all the ways

138
0:08:32.562,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that we can grow healthy microbes in our own ecosystems.

139
0:08:37.482,000 --> 0:08:41,000
A great example of this is architects

140
0:08:41.737,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who are imagining the skin of a building

141
0:08:45.523,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to function like the bark of a tree.

142
0:08:48.68,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But not as a cosmetic green layer.

143
0:08:51.982,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They're designing architectural barks

144
0:08:55.276,000 --> 0:08:58,000
as hosts for evolving ecologies.

145
0:09:00.104,000 --> 0:09:05,000
These surface structures are designed to invite life in.

146
0:09:06.239,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And if we applied the same energy we currently do suppressing forms of life

147
0:09:11.673,000 --> 0:09:13,000
towards cultivating life,

148
0:09:14.673,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we'd turn the negative image of the urban jungle

149
0:09:18.424,000 --> 0:09:23,000
into one that literally embodies a thriving, living ecosystem.

150
0:09:24.734,000 --> 0:09:29,000
By actively encouraging surface interactions with healthy microbes,

151
0:09:30.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we could improve passive climate control,

152
0:09:33.712,000 --> 0:09:34,000
stormwater management

153
0:09:35.569,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and even reduce CO2 emissions

154
0:09:37.728,000 --> 0:09:41,000
by lowering the energy used to heat or cool our buildings.

155
0:09:42.847,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We're just beginning to realize the potential

156
0:09:46.967,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of nature-based technologies.

157
0:09:50.141,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I'm excited that we're starting to design and biofabricate

158
0:09:55.188,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a new material world.

159
0:10:01.177,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's one that moves away from the exploitation

160
0:10:05.462,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of nonrenewable resources

161
0:10:07.939,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to working with the original, renewable life.

162
0:10:12.819,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Instead of designing out life,

163
0:10:14.895,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we're designing with it and for it.

164
0:10:18.934,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Packaging, fashion, footwear, furniture, construction --

165
0:10:22.992,000 --> 0:10:27,000
biofabricated products can be grown close to centers of demand,

166
0:10:28.167,000 --> 0:10:31,000
with local resources, less land, energy,

167
0:10:31.961,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and even harnessing industrial waste streams.

168
0:10:36.924,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It used to be that the tools of biotechnology

169
0:10:40.949,000 --> 0:10:42,000
were the preserve of powerful,

170
0:10:43.34,000 --> 0:10:47,000
multinational chemical and biotech companies.

171
0:10:47.95,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In the last century, we expected material innovation

172
0:10:52.085,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to come from the likes of DuPont, Dow, BASF.

173
0:10:57.173,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But this 21st-century material revolution is being led by start-ups

174
0:11:03.204,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with small teams and limited capital.

175
0:11:06.903,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And by the way, not all their founders have science degrees.

176
0:11:10.95,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They include artists, architects and designers.

177
0:11:16.538,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Over a billion dollars has already been invested

178
0:11:20.316,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in start-ups biofabricating consumer products.

179
0:11:25.316,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I don't think we have a choice but to biofabricate our future.

180
0:11:30.938,000 --> 0:11:31,000
From the jacket you're wearing

181
0:11:32.446,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to the chair you're sitting in

182
0:11:34.026,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to the home you live in,

183
0:11:35.772,000 --> 0:11:4,000
your designed material world shouldn't compromise your health

184
0:11:41.379,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or that of our planet.

185
0:11:43.879,000 --> 0:11:45,000
If materials can't be recycled

186
0:11:45.903,000 --> 0:11:47,000
or naturally composted at home,

187
0:11:48.466,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we should reject them.

188
0:11:49.998,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I'm committed to making this future a reality

189
0:11:54.561,000 --> 0:11:57,000
by shining a light on all the amazing work

190
0:11:58.227,000 --> 0:11:59,000
being done today

191
0:11:59.783,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and by facilitating more interactions

192
0:12:02.815,000 --> 0:12:06,000
between designers, scientists, investors and brands.

193
0:12:07.581,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Because we need a material revolution,

194
0:12:10.771,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we need it now.

195
0:12:12.914,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

196
0:12:14.112,000 --> 0:12:18,000

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's something which is suspended

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
between what we believe we can be,

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and a tradition we may have forgotten.

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And yet, when I look at the environment outside,

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you see how resistant architecture is to change.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We can think them out. We can create incredible things.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And yet, at the end,

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it's so hard to change a wall.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We applaud the well-mannered box.

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to create something that has never been,

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I think that's really what architecture is based on.

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Architecture is not based on concrete

20
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and steel and the elements of the soil.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's based on wonder.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the greatest spaces that we have had.

24
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
By the way, it is a story that is told through

26
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
its hard materials.

27
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But it is a story of effort and struggle

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
against improbabilities.

29
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,

30
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of the pyramids, of pagodas,

31
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of cities in India and beyond,

32
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you think of how incredible this is that that was realized

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
not by some abstract idea, but by people.

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, anything that has been made can be unmade.

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Anything that has been made can be made better.

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There it is: the things that I really believe

37
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
are of important architecture.

38
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
These are the dimensions that I like to work with.

39
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's something very personal.

40
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics

41
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or architecture critics or city planners.

42
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
But I think these are the necessary oxygen

43
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for us to live in buildings, to live in cities,

44
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to connect ourselves in a social space.

45
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.

46
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.

47
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,

48
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it is that belief that I think drives society.

51
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.

52
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And yet it is in times like this

53
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,

54
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.

55
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They were built in times that were

57
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
not really the best of times in a certain way.

58
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And yet that energy and power of architecture

59
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.

60
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So again, I am a believer in the expressive.

61
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I have never been a fan of the neutral.

62
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
I don't like neutrality in life, in anything.

63
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I think expression.

64
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.

65
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's what expression is.

66
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's been missing in much of the architecture,

67
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,

68
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,

69
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that has no value.

70
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And yet, I believe it is the expression --

71
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
expression of the city, expression of our own space --

72
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that gives meaning to architecture.

73
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.

74
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Expressive spaces are not spaces

75
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that simply confirm what we already know.

76
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Expressive spaces may disturb us.

77
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And I think that's also part of life.

78
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,

79
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but to reach out across the abyss of history,

80
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to places we have never been,

81
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.

82
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So again, radical versus conservative.

83
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,

84
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.

85
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.

86
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde

87
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of dead forms.

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It is actually a living connection

89
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to the cosmic event that we are part of,

90
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and a story that is certainly ongoing.

91
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.

92
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's actually a story in which our acts themselves

93
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
are pushing the story in a particular way.

94
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.

95
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You know the Soviet architecture of that building

96
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is the conservation.

97
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.

98
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions

99
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that have obstructed the mind in moving forward

100
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and of course what is radical is to confront them.

101
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I think our architecture is a confrontation

102
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with our own senses.

103
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Therefore I believe it should not be cool.

104
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.

105
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.

106
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Life without emotion would really not be life.

107
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Even the mind is emotional.

108
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There is no reason which does not take a position

109
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.

110
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So I think emotion is a dimension

111
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that is important to introduce into city space, into city life.

112
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.

113
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.

114
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,

115
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is a conversation that I think

116
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
cities themselves have fostered.

117
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I think that is the progress of cities.

118
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's not only the forms of cities,

119
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but the fact that they incarnate emotions,

120
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
not just of those who build them,

121
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but of those who live there as well.

122
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.

123
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But architecture is not the language of words.

124
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced

125
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.

126
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal

127
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
tell you a story, but the story is very short,

128
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
which says, "We have no story to tell you."

129
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So the important thing actually,

131
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,

132
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which might be totally inexplicable in words,

133
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because they operate in proportions,

134
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in materials, in light.

135
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They connect themselves into various sources,

136
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
into a kind of complex vector matrix

137
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that isn't really frontal

138
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but is really embedded in the lives,

139
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and in the history of a city, and of a people.

140
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit

141
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I think is a false notion,

142
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which has reduced architecture into banality.

143
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Hand versus the computer.

144
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Of course, what would we be without computers?

145
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Our whole practice depends on computing.

146
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;

147
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.

148
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because I believe that the hand

149
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,

150
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
has a source, though the source is unknown,

151
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
though we don't have to be mystical about it.

152
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We realize that the hand has been given us

153
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.

154
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I think when I draw drawings

155
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings --

156
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
drawings that can come from sources

157
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that are completely not known, not normal, not seen,

158
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working --

159
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
how can we make the computer respond to our hand

160
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
rather than the hand responding to the computer.

161
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.

162
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda

163
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.

164
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,

165
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.

166
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,

167
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,

168
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
genetics, economics

169
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are complex complex fields.

170
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
There is no reason that architecture should shy away

171
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and present this illusory world of the simple.

172
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It is complex. Space is complex.

173
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.

174
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And as wondrous as it is,

175
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification

176
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that we have often come to be admired.

177
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And yet, our lives are complex.

178
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Our emotions are complex.

179
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Our intellectual desires are complex.

180
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So I do believe that architecture as I see it

181
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,

182
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in every intimacy that we possess.

183
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Of course that means that architecture is political.

184
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The political is not an enemy of architecture.

185
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The politeama is the city. It's all of us together.

186
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And I've always believed that the act of architecture,

187
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,

188
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because it will be visible to others.

189
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.

190
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So again, the evasion of that sphere,

191
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,

192
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object

193
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
has never appealed to me.

194
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I do believe that this interaction

195
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with the history, with history that is often very difficult,

196
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to grapple with it, to create

197
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.

198
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Because architecture is also the asking of questions.

199
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's not only the giving of answers.

200
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions.

201
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Therefore it is important that it be real.

202
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You know we can simulate almost anything.

203
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But the one thing that can be ever simulated

204
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is the human heart, the human soul.

205
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it

206
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.

207
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.

208
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.

209
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window,

210
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the threshold, the bed --

211
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
such prosaic objects. And yet,

212
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,

213
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is so enigmatic and so rich,

214
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and create something in the real world.

215
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Create a space for an office,

216
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a space of sustainability

217
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that really works between that virtuality

218
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and yet can be realized as something real.

219
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Unexpected versus habitual.

220
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.

221
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's a self-induced poison.

222
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So the unexpected is always unexpected.

223
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,

224
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
will always be unexpected.

225
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.

226
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us

227
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the false sort of stability,

228
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but an architecture that is full of tension,

229
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
an architecture that goes beyond itself

230
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to reach a human soul and a human heart,

231
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and that breaks out of the shackles of habits.

232
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And of course habits are enforced by architecture.

233
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
When we see the same kind of architecture

234
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we become immured in that world of those angles,

235
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of those lights, of those materials.

236
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We think the world really looks like our buildings.

237
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders

238
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that have been part of them.

239
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So again, the unexpected which is also the raw.

240
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And I often think of the raw and the refined.

241
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
What is raw? The raw, I would say

242
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is the naked experience, untouched by luxury,

243
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
untouched by expensive materials,

244
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
untouched by the kind of refinement

245
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that we associate with high culture.

246
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So the rawness, I think, in space,

247
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future

248
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
translate into a raw space,

249
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
a space that isn't decorated,

250
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a space that is not mannered in any source,

251
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,

252
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
might be refractive to our desires.

253
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
A space that doesn't always follow us

254
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
like a dog that has been trained to follow us,

255
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating

256
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
other possibilities, other experiences,

257
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.

258
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me

259
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.

260
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,

261
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
something which is focused on reality,

262
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
something that has the power, through its leverage,

263
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to transform even a very small space.

264
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
So architecture maybe is not so big, like science,

265
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but through its focal point

266
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it can leverage in an Archimedian way

267
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
what we think the world is really about.

268
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And often it takes just a building

269
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,

270
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.

271
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And of course buildings have their shapes.

272
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Those shapes are difficult to change.

273
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And yet, I do believe that in every social space,

274
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in every public space,

275
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
there is a desire to communicate more

276
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,

277
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions

278
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
forward, backward, sideways and around.

279
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So that is indeed what is memory.

280
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So I believe that my main interest is to memory.

281
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Without memory we would be amnesiacs.

282
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We would not know which way we were going,

283
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and why we are going where we're going.

284
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,

285
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
rehashing of the same things over and over again,

286
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
which, of course, get accolades of critics.

287
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.

288
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But I rather play something

289
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
completely unheard of,

290
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and even with flaws,

291
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed

292
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
by its meaninglessness.

293
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.

294
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Without the memory there would be no story to tell.

295
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
There would be nowhere to turn.

296
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.

297
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And it's not only our memory,

298
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but those who remember us,

299
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
which means that architecture is not mute.

300
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It's an art of communication.

301
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.

302
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.

303
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It can reach into millennia

304
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that have been buried,

305
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and return them in a just and unexpected equity.

306
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So again, I think the notion that

307
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.

308
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.

309
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.

310
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And that indeed is the architectural mission

311
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that I believe is important,

312
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
is to create spaces that are vibrant,

313
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that are pluralistic,

314
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that can transform the most prosaic activities,

315
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and raise them to a completely different expectation.

316
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Create a shopping center, a swimming place

317
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that is more like a museum than like entertainment.

318
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And these are our dreams.

319
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.

320
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,

321
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it should not play it safe.

322
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe

323
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.

324
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And I think, of course,

325
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
risk is what underlies the world.

326
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
World without risk would not be worth living.

327
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.

328
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.

329
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Risks of spaces that have never been

330
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
so dizzying,

331
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
as they should be, for a pioneering city.

332
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Risks that really move architecture

333
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
even with all its flaws, into a space which is much better

334
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that the ever again repeated

335
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
hollowness of a ready-made thing.

336
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.

337
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
It's about space. It's not about fashion.

338
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It's not about decoration.

339
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It's about creating with minimal means

340
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
something which can not be repeated,

341
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
cannot be simulated in any other sphere.

342
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,

343
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
is the space we need to dream.

344
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
These are the spaces that are

345
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
not just luxurious spaces for some of us,

346
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but are important for everybody in this world.

347
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.

348
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's about carving out a space for trees.

349
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's carving out a space where nature can enter

350
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the domestic world of a city.

351
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
A space where something which has never seen a light of day

352
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
can enter into the inner workings of a density.

353
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And I think that is really the nature of architecture.

354
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Now I am a believer in democracy.

355
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I don't like beautiful buildings

356
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
built for totalitarian regimes.

357
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.

358
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.

359
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And yet when I think of the poverty of society

360
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
which doesn't give freedom to its people,

361
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I don't admire those buildings.

362
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.

363
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And of course, at Ground Zero what else?

364
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
It's such a complex project.

365
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It's emotional. There is so many interests.

366
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It's political. There is so many parties to this project.

367
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.

368
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
There are emotions of the victims.

369
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,

370
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I would not have liked somebody to say,

371
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want."

372
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I think nothing good will come out of that.

373
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I think architecture is about consensus.

374
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.

375
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Compromise, if it's artistic,

376
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
if it is able to cope with its strategies --

377
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and there is my first sketch and the last rendering --

378
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
it's not that far away.

379
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And yet, compromise, consensus,

380
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that is what I believe in.

381
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.

382
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
It's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.

383
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And that is where I end.

384
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant

385
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
on a ship like millions of others,

386
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
looking at America from that point of view.

387
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
This is America. This is liberty.

388
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
This is what we dream about. Its individuality,

389
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.

390
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents,

391
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.

392
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
(Applause)

393
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

394
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
So have you come to peace

395
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
with the process that happened at Ground Zero

396
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?

397
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Daniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves

398
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
of the notion that we are authoritarian,

399
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that we can determine everything that happens.

400
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
We have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.

401
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,

402
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.

403
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win

404
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.

405
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero

406
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
will be meaningful, will be inspiring,

407
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
will tell other generations of the sacrifices,

408
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
of the meaning of this event.

409
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Not just for New York, but for the world.

410
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Daniel Libeskind.

411
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
(Applause)

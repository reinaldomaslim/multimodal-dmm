1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,

5
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --

6
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,

7
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,

8
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the body formerly known as a planet.

9
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:

10
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,

11
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,

12
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and we, living on it, came to be.

13
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to

14
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and search for answers to questions like this,

15
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --

16
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --

17
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail

18
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space

19
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,

20
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost

21
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that humanity had ever established around the Sun.

22
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.

23
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,

24
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.

25
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot

26
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.

27
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,

28
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.

29
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,

30
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

31
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor

32
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
for a much larger human voyage

33
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,

34
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and also how humans fit into that picture.

35
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.

36
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken

37
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.

38
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories

39
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition

40
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we are conducting around Saturn,

41
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and have been for the past two and a half years.

42
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.

43
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.

44
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,

45
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,

46
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,

47
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.

48
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.

49
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,

50
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and, until Cassini had arrived there,

51
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain

52
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
that we had remaining in our solar system.

53
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.

54
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It has a very large, thick atmosphere,

55
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be

56
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,

57
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.

58
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,

59
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
except that its atmosphere is suffused with

60
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.

61
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan

62
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:39,000
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.

63
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.

64
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface

65
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.

66
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But these haze particles, it was surmised,

67
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,

68
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface

69
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in a thick organic sludge.

70
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.

71
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,

72
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:19,000
especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.

73
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.

74
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's a condensable in the atmosphere,

75
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore

76
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,

77
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,

78
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.

79
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

80
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.

81
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers

82
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.

83
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,

84
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.

85
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.

86
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.

87
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,

88
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it might be raining, and you might be standing

89
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)

90
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,

91
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,

92
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.

93
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --

94
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.

95
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.

96
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.

97
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And yet another moon there --

98
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.

99
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface

100
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.

101
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And we have taken pictures like this.

102
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.

103
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.

104
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:23,000
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things

105
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.

106
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,

107
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,

108
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
meaning it's a very young surface.

109
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And there are features that look tectonic.

110
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They look like they've been pulled apart.

111
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,

112
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.

113
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so it's been tectonically altered.

114
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But we couldn't make sense of our images,

115
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
until, six months after we got into orbit,

116
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
an event occurred that many have regarded

117
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.

118
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,

119
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried

120
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,

121
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.

122
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.

123
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is a device of human making,

124
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.

125
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It is so significant that, in my mind,

126
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this was an event that should have been celebrated

127
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,

128
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and sadly, that wasn't the case.

129
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter).

130
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,

131
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,

132
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,

133
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.

134
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It was a moving demonstration of what the words

135
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"united nations" are supposed to mean:

136
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:05,000
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.

137
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,

138
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and to come to understand a planetary system

139
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,

140
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and now humans had actually touched it.

141
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.

142
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It was a tremendously emotional event,

143
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.

144
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause).

145
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,

146
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it also took panoramic pictures.

147
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures

148
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.

149
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted

150
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
those other pictures taken from orbit to be.

151
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.

152
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.

153
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And you can follow these channels

154
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and you can see how they all converge.

155
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.

156
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You are looking at a shoreline.

157
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.

158
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.

159
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.

160
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.

161
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.

162
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,

163
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you would be flying at these altitudes.

164
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines

165
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)

166
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,

167
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,

168
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.

169
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And here is the horizon, OK?

170
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?

171
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause).

172
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions

173
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.

174
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What the probe came down in was basically

175
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.

176
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.

177
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And it's probably the case that this material

178
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
has washed off the highlands of Titan

179
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:3,000
through these channels that we saw,

180
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.

181
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.

182
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But still, there was no sign in our images,

183
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:46,000
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.

184
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.

185
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,

186
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,

187
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
separated by a few kilometers,

188
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.

189
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.

190
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.

191
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.

192
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,

193
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.

194
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.

195
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.

196
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And then, only a week and a half ago,

197
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,

198
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.

199
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,

200
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:48,000
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.

201
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan

202
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,

203
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and having Earth-like geological formations

204
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and a tremendous geographical diversity,

205
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system

206
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.

207
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,

208
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:21,000
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,

209
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.

210
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter).

211
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,

212
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.

213
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It is a very geologically active body.

214
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus

215
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --

216
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
where we found this system of fractures.

217
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.

218
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.

219
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,

220
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.

221
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:04,000
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.

222
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered

223
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles

224
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
extending hundreds of miles into space.

225
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,

226
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we see that these jets feed a plume

227
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles

228
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
into the space above Enceladus.

229
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
My team and I have examined images like this,

230
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.

231
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And we have arrived at the conclusion

232
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that these jets may be erupting from pockets

233
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.

234
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.

235
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon

236
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,

237
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.

238
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life

239
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
elsewhere in our solar system,

240
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,

241
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.

242
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred

243
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,

244
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times

245
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:29,000
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.

246
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.

247
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It is precious, it is unique,

248
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.

249
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --

250
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --

251
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
you would remember this very famous picture

252
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.

253
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,

254
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:,000
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,

255
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.

256
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,

257
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:13,000
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.

258
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.

259
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,

260
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,

261
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
you see the refracted image of the Sun

262
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and you see this ring created, in fact,

263
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
by the exhalations of Enceladus.

264
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:37,000
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,

265
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
sight of our own planet,

266
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:43,000
cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.

267
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Now, there is something deeply moving

268
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
about seeing ourselves from afar,

269
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet

270
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in the skies of other worlds.

271
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,

272
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:,000
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn

273
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.

274
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And thank you very much.

275
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause)

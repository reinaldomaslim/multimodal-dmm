0:00:12.48,000 --> 0:00:15,000
A hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein

2
0:00:16.2,000 --> 0:00:19,000
stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin

3
0:00:19.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity:

4
0:00:23.96,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the general theory of relativity.

5
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece,

6
0:00:30.08,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales,

7
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:36,000
capturing in one beautiful line of algebra

8
0:00:36.48,000 --> 0:00:4,000
everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.

9
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist.

10
0:00:44.84,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head.

11
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One was Einstein's theory of relativity,

12
0:00:50.72,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the other was arguably even more revolutionary:

13
0:00:53.92,000 --> 0:00:54,000
quantum mechanics,

14
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way

15
0:00:58.96,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.

16
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed

17
0:01:07.6,000 --> 0:01:08,000
our understanding of the universe.

18
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics

19
0:01:11.72,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that we've learned what the universe is made from,

20
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:16,000
how it began and how it continues to evolve.

21
0:01:17.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics,

22
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but what's at stake now is rather different.

23
0:01:24.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able

24
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to continue to increase our understanding of nature,

25
0:01:30.2,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science,

26
0:01:33.64,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we could be facing questions that we cannot answer,

27
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:39,000
not because we don't have the brains or technology,

28
0:01:40.2,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.

29
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting.

30
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest

31
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that the universe should be a boring place.

32
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.

33
0:01:57.08,000 --> 0:02:,000
But when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff,

34
0:02:01.04,000 --> 0:02:04,000
full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.

35
0:02:04.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The question is, ultimately,

36
0:02:05.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
why does all this interesting stuff exist?

37
0:02:08.96,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Why is there something rather than nothing?

38
0:02:13.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics,

39
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it.

40
0:02:23.08,000 --> 0:02:26,000
At the heart of this problem are two numbers,

41
0:02:26.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
two extremely dangerous numbers.

42
0:02:28.72,000 --> 0:02:3,000
These are properties of the universe that we can measure,

43
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and they're extremely dangerous

44
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because if they were different, even by a tiny bit,

45
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
then the universe as we know it would not exist.

46
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made

47
0:02:42.2,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine,

48
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the largest scientific device ever built by the human race,

49
0:02:48.28,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the Large Hadron Collider.

50
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring,

51
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
getting them closer and closer to the speed of light

52
0:02:56.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors.

53
0:03:01.32,000 --> 0:03:05,000
On July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world

54
0:03:05.84,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle

55
0:03:08.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
being created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson.

56
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, if you followed the news at the time,

57
0:03:15.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed,

58
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and you'd be forgiven for thinking

59
0:03:20.28,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we get that way every time we discover a new particle.

60
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well, that is kind of true,

61
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but the Higgs boson is particularly special.

62
0:03:26.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We all got so excited because finding the Higgs

63
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:32,000
proves the existence of a cosmic energy field.

64
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, you may have trouble imagining an energy field,

65
0:03:35.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but we've all experienced one.

66
0:03:36.853,000 --> 0:03:38,000
If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal

67
0:03:39.413,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and felt a force pulling across that gap,

68
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:42,000
then you've felt the effect of a field.

69
0:03:43.442,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field,

70
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
except it has a constant value everywhere.

71
0:03:49.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's all around us right now.

72
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We can't see it or touch it,

73
0:03:52.92,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but if it wasn't there,

74
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we would not exist.

75
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The Higgs field gives mass

76
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
to the fundamental particles that we're made from.

77
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:02,000
If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass,

78
0:04:03.04,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and no atoms could form and there would be no us.

79
0:04:06.88,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field.

80
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings,

81
0:04:15.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a bit like a light switch.

82
0:04:16.76,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It should either be off,

83
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so that it has a zero value everywhere in space,

84
0:04:20.84,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value.

85
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist,

86
0:04:27.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and therefore all the other interesting stuff

87
0:04:29.76,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we see around us in the universe would not exist.

88
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on,

89
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value,

90
0:04:41.72,000 --> 0:04:45,000
a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.

91
0:04:46.48,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And this value is crucial.

92
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If it were a tiny bit different,

93
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
then there would be no physical structure in the universe.

94
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So this is the first of our dangerous numbers,

95
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the strength of the Higgs field.

96
0:04:57.96,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Theorists have spent decades trying to understand

97
0:05:00.72,000 --> 0:05:02,000
why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number,

98
0:05:03.4,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they've come up with a number of possible explanations.

99
0:05:06.24,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry"

100
0:05:09.2,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or "large extra dimensions."

101
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now,

102
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but the key point is this:

103
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,

104
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
then we should see new particles being created at the LHC

105
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
along with the Higgs boson.

106
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So far, though, we've not seen any sign of them.

107
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But there's actually an even worse example

108
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number,

109
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and this time it comes from the other end of the scale,

110
0:05:37.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
from studying the universe at vast distances.

111
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity

112
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:48,000
was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time

113
0:05:48.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.

114
0:05:52.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory,

115
0:05:55.24,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the universe has been expanding ever since

116
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion.

117
0:06:01.52,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery

118
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up.

119
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster

120
0:06:10.88,000 --> 0:06:13,000
driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy.

121
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics,

122
0:06:17.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
you should get very suspicious

123
0:06:19.24,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.

124
0:06:22.32,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:23.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We don't know what dark energy is,

126
0:06:25.4,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself,

127
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the energy of the vacuum.

128
0:06:32.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out

129
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:35,000
how strong dark energy should be,

130
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you get an absolutely astonishing result.

131
0:06:39.84,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You find that dark energy

132
0:06:41.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger

133
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
than the value we observe from astronomy.

134
0:06:48.56,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That's one with 120 zeroes after it.

135
0:06:53.4,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge

136
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that it's impossible to get your head around.

137
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers.

138
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Well, even that one won't do here.

139
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This number is bigger than any number in astronomy.

140
0:07:05.88,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger

141
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
than the number of atoms in the entire universe.

142
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So that's a pretty bad prediction.

143
0:07:14.28,000 --> 0:07:16,000
In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics,

144
0:07:17.019,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity.

145
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
If dark energy were anywhere near this strong,

146
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
then the universe would have been torn apart,

147
0:07:25.24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
stars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here.

148
0:07:29.24,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So this is the second of those dangerous numbers,

149
0:07:31.6,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the strength of dark energy,

150
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning

151
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:37,000
than we saw for the Higgs field.

152
0:07:38.84,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation.

153
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The hope was that a complete combination

154
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of Einstein's general theory of relativity,

155
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which is the theory of the universe at grand scales,

156
0:07:52.32,000 --> 0:07:55,000
with quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales,

157
0:07:55.8,000 --> 0:07:56,000
might provide a solution.

158
0:07:57.68,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Einstein himself spent most of his later years

159
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
on a futile search for a unified theory of physics,

160
0:08:03.36,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and physicists have kept at it ever since.

161
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:1,000
One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory,

162
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and the essential idea is,

163
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:15,000
if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world,

164
0:08:15.76,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you'd see actually that they're not particles at all,

165
0:08:18.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but tiny vibrating strings of energy,

166
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:25,000
with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle,

167
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a bit like musical notes on a guitar string.

168
0:08:28.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world,

169
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but it has one catastrophic problem.

170
0:08:35.56,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all,

171
0:08:38.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but a whole collection of theories.

172
0:08:40.8,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's been estimated, in fact,

173
0:08:42.24,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory.

174
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Each one would describe a different universe

175
0:08:48.6,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with different laws of physics.

176
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, critics say this makes string theory unscientific.

177
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You can't disprove the theory.

178
0:08:55.36,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But others actually turned this on its head

179
0:08:57.384,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and said, well, maybe this apparent failure

180
0:08:59.68,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is string theory's greatest triumph.

181
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes

182
0:09:05.44,000 --> 0:09:07,000
actually exist out there somewhere

183
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in some grand multiverse?

184
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Suddenly we can understand

185
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers.

186
0:09:15.76,000 --> 0:09:16,000
In most of the multiverse,

187
0:09:17.08,000 --> 0:09:19,000
dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart,

188
0:09:20.08,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form.

189
0:09:23.44,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We live in one of the places in the multiverse

190
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:27,000
where the two numbers are just right.

191
0:09:28.04,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We live in a Goldilocks universe.

192
0:09:31.64,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why.

193
0:09:36.52,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If we follow this line of thinking,

194
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
then we will never be able to answer the question,

195
0:09:40.84,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"Why is there something rather than nothing?"

196
0:09:43.32,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In most of the multiverse, there is nothing,

197
0:09:45.52,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and we live in one of the few places

198
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:5,000
where the laws of physics allow there to be something.

199
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Even worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse.

200
0:09:54.52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We can't access these other universes,

201
0:09:56.68,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not.

202
0:10:01.64,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So we're in an extremely frustrating position.

203
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist.

204
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:09,000
There are other planets, other stars, other galaxies,

205
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so why not other universes?

206
0:10:12.52,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure.

207
0:10:16.72,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while,

208
0:10:20.08,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints

209
0:10:23.36,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that this line of reasoning may get born out.

210
0:10:27.28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC,

211
0:10:30.68,000 --> 0:10:31,000
what we were looking for there --

212
0:10:32.276,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we were looking for new theories of physics:

213
0:10:34.36,000 --> 0:10:35,000
supersymmetry or large extra dimensions

214
0:10:36.28,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.

215
0:10:40.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness

216
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:46,000
populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.

217
0:10:48.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
My experiment published paper after paper

218
0:10:51.04,000 --> 0:10:55,000
where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics.

219
0:10:56.4,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The stakes now could not be higher.

220
0:10:59.08,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation

221
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run.

222
0:11:05.28,000 --> 0:11:07,000
What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for

223
0:11:07.96,000 --> 0:11:09,000
are signs of new particles, micro black holes,

224
0:11:10.76,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or maybe something totally unexpected

225
0:11:12.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.

226
0:11:16.52,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If so, then we can continue this long journey

227
0:11:18.88,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein

228
0:11:21.48,000 --> 0:11:24,000
towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature.

229
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But if, in two or three years' time,

230
0:11:27.8,000 --> 0:11:3,000
when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown,

231
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,

232
0:11:33.48,000 --> 0:11:36,000
then we may be entering a new era in physics:

233
0:11:37.32,000 --> 0:11:41,000
an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain;

234
0:11:42.12,000 --> 0:11:45,000
an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse

235
0:11:45.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach;

236
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
an era where we will never be able to answer the question,

237
0:11:52.28,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"Why is there something rather than nothing?"

238
0:11:55.36,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you.

239
0:11:56.6,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

240
0:12:03.04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Bruno Giussani: Harry, even if you just said

241
0:12:06.12,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the science may not have some answers,

242
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I would like to ask you a couple of questions, and the first is:

243
0:12:11.04,000 --> 0:12:14,000
building something like the LHC is a generational project.

244
0:12:14.08,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world.

245
0:12:18.4,000 --> 0:12:2,000
How do you think so long term,

246
0:12:21.28,000 --> 0:12:24,000
projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this?

247
0:12:24.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky

248
0:12:26.08,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008,

249
0:12:28.92,000 --> 0:12:29,000
just as we were switching on,

250
0:12:30.325,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and there are people in my research group who have been working on it

251
0:12:33.6,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for three decades, their entire careers on one machine.

252
0:12:36.24,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976,

253
0:12:39.44,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and you start planning the machine without the technology

254
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that you know you're going to need to be able to build it.

255
0:12:44.6,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So the computing power did not exist in the early '90s

256
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
when design work began in earnest.

257
0:12:48.804,000 --> 0:12:5,000
One of the big detectors which record these collisions,

258
0:12:51.044,000 --> 0:12:52,000
they didn't think there was technology

259
0:12:52.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC,

260
0:12:55.8,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object

261
0:12:58.56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
with some detectors around the outside,

262
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but subsequently we have developed technology.

263
0:13:02.08,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So you have to rely on people's ingenuity, that they will solve the problems,

264
0:13:05.44,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but it may be a decade or more down the line.

265
0:13:07.32,000 --> 0:13:09,000
BG: China just announced two or three weeks ago

266
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that they intend to build

267
0:13:11.04,000 --> 0:13:13,000
a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.

268
0:13:14.04,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news.

269
0:13:17.68,000 --> 0:13:19,000
HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno. BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.

270
0:13:20.44,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Laughter)

271
0:13:22.24,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that.

272
0:13:24.36,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But I mean, seriously, it's great news.

273
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So building a machine like the LHC

274
0:13:29.24,000 --> 0:13:31,000
requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources.

275
0:13:32.04,000 --> 0:13:34,000
No one nation can afford to build a machine this large,

276
0:13:34.4,000 --> 0:13:35,000
apart from maybe China,

277
0:13:35.64,000 --> 0:13:37,000
because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources,

278
0:13:37.88,000 --> 0:13:39,000
manpower and money to build machines like this.

279
0:13:39.96,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So it's only a good thing.

280
0:13:41.24,000 --> 0:13:43,000
What they're really planning to do is to build a machine

281
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues

282
0:13:46.36,000 --> 0:13:48,000
as to whether these new ideas, like supersymmetry, are really out there,

283
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so it's great news for physics, I think.

284
0:13:51.249,000 --> 0:13:53,000
BG: Harry, thank you. HC: Thank you very much.

285
0:13:53.449,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.683,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is a work in process,

2
0:00:16.617,000 --> 0:00:2,000
based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago

3
0:00:21.176,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about the need for the storage of vaccine.

4
0:00:24.849,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Video): [On this planet

5
0:00:26.493,000 --> 0:00:28,000
1.6 billion people

6
0:00:29.032,000 --> 0:00:3,000
don't have access to electricity

7
0:00:31.021,000 --> 0:00:35,000
refrigeration

8
0:00:35.18,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or stored fuels

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
this is a problem

10
0:00:41.619,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it impacts:

11
0:00:44.425,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the spread of disease

12
0:00:47.671,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the storage of food and medicine

13
0:00:49.503,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the quality of life.

14
0:00:53.43,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So here's the plan ... inexpensive refrigeration

15
0:00:55.719,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that doesn't use electricity, propane, gas, kerosene or consumables

16
0:01:01.159,000 --> 0:01:03,000
time for some thermodynamics

17
0:01:03.675,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator]

18
0:01:06.421,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher

19
0:01:09.071,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who talked about absorption and refrigeration, one of those things

20
0:01:12.198,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that stuck in my head, a lot like the Stirling engine:

21
0:01:14.75,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it.

22
0:01:17.225,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carré,

23
0:01:19.799,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but he couldn't actually build anything with it

24
0:01:22.088,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because of the tools at the time.

25
0:01:23.733,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing

26
0:01:27.997,000 --> 0:01:29,000
called the IcyBall, in 1928.

27
0:01:30.021,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work,

28
0:01:33.086,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but here's how it works.

29
0:01:34.284,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.

30
0:01:36.884,000 --> 0:01:38,000
One has a working fluid, water and ammonia,

31
0:01:39.264,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the other is a condenser.

32
0:01:40.876,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You heat up one side, the hot side.

33
0:01:42.865,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The ammonia evaporates and it recondenses in the other side.

34
0:01:45.908,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You let it cool to room temperature,

35
0:01:48.47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and then, as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water

36
0:01:51.657,000 --> 0:01:52,000
back on the erstwhile hot side,

37
0:01:53.284,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it creates a powerful cooling effect.

38
0:01:55.577,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So it was a great idea that didn't work at all.

39
0:01:58.018,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They blew up.

40
0:01:59.236,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:00.795,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Because you're using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures

42
0:02:03.606,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if you heated them wrong;

43
0:02:04.897,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it topped 400 psi.

44
0:02:06.676,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The ammonia was toxic, it sprayed everywhere.

45
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But it was kind of an interesting thought.

46
0:02:11.036,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So the great thing about 2006,

47
0:02:13.492,000 --> 0:02:15,000
there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.

48
0:02:16.371,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved --

49
0:02:20.47,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a lot of computational fluid dynamics.

50
0:02:22.324,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.

51
0:02:26.283,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We found some nontoxic refrigerants

52
0:02:28.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that worked at very low vapor pressures.

53
0:02:30.962,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We brought in a team from the UK --

54
0:02:32.675,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a lot of great refrigeration people, it turns out, in the UK --

55
0:02:35.674,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact,

56
0:02:37.978,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we could make a low-pressure, nontoxic refrigerator.

57
0:02:41.245,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So this is the way it works.

58
0:02:42.617,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You put it on a cooking fire.

59
0:02:44.053,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Most people have cooking fires in the world,

60
0:02:46.187,000 --> 0:02:47,000
whether it's camel dung or wood.

61
0:02:47.765,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.

62
0:02:51.57,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.

63
0:02:55.273,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It looks like this.

64
0:02:56.519,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is the fifth prototype, it's not quite done.

65
0:02:59.36,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.

66
0:03:02.368,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons,

67
0:03:05.974,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it'll cool it down to just above freezing --

68
0:03:08.47,000 --> 0:03:09,000
three degrees above freezing --

69
0:03:09.972,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.

70
0:03:13.036,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's really cheap.

71
0:03:14.247,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars,

72
0:03:17.347,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in low volumes for about 40 dollars.

73
0:03:19.102,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have.

74
0:03:22.596,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Thank you.

75
0:03:23.796,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm from Detroit.

2
0:00:15.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:23,000
A city that in the 1950s was the world's industrial giant,

4
0:00:24.76,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with a population of 1.8 million people

5
0:00:27.52,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and 140 square miles of land and infrastructure,

6
0:00:32.12,000 --> 0:00:35,000
used to support this booming, Midwestern urban center.

7
0:00:37.04,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And now today,

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
just a half a century later,

9
0:00:41.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Detroit is the poster child for urban decay.

10
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Currently in Detroit, our population is under 700,000,

11
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of which 84 percent are African American,

12
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and due to decades of disinvestment

13
0:00:57.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and capital flight

14
0:01:00.08,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from the city into the suburbs,

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
there is a scarcity in Detroit.

16
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There is a scarcity of retail,

17
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
more specifically, fresh food retail,

18
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:17,000
resulting in a city where 70 percent of Detroiters

19
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are obese and overweight,

20
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and they struggle.

21
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They struggle to access nutritious food that they need,

22
0:01:27.6,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that they need to stay healthy,

23
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that they need to prevent premature illness and diet-related diseases.

24
0:01:35.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Far too many Detroiters live closer to a fast food restaurant

25
0:01:41.52,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or to a convenience store, or to a gas station

26
0:01:44.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
where they have to shop for food

27
0:01:46.92,000 --> 0:01:49,000
than they do a full-service supermarket.

28
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And this is not good news about the city of Detroit,

29
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but this is the news

30
0:02:00.2,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the story

31
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that Detroiters intend to change.

32
0:02:04.6,000 --> 0:02:05,000
No, I'm going to take that back.

33
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is the story that Detroiters are changing,

34
0:02:11.36,000 --> 0:02:14,000
through urban agriculture and food entrepreneurship.

35
0:02:16.08,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Here's the thing:

36
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because of Detroit's recent history,

37
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it now finds itself

38
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with some very unique assets,

39
0:02:25.6,000 --> 0:02:27,000
open land being one of them.

40
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Experts say that the entire cities of Boston, San Francisco,

41
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the borough of Manhattan

42
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:38,000
will fit in the land area of the city of Detroit.

43
0:02:39.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They further go on to say

44
0:02:40.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that 40 square miles of the city is vacant.

45
0:02:45.04,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That's a quarter to a third of the city,

46
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and with that level of emptiness,

47
0:02:49.72,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it creates a landscape unlike any other big city.

48
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So Detroit has this -- open land, fertile soil,

49
0:03:00.04,000 --> 0:03:02,000
proximity to water,

50
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:03,000
willing labor

51
0:03:03.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and a desperate demand for healthy, fresh food.

52
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:11,000
All of this has created a people-powered grassroots movement

53
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of people in Detroit

54
0:03:13.6,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who are transforming this city

55
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
from what was the capital of American industry

56
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
into an agrarian paradise.

57
0:03:22.306,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Applause)

58
0:03:23.48,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You know, I think, out of all the cities in the world,

59
0:03:27.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Detroit, Michigan, is best positioned to serve as the world's urban exemplar

60
0:03:33.36,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of food security and sustainable development.

61
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In Detroit, we have over 1,500, yes, 1,500

62
0:03:41.96,000 --> 0:03:45,000
gardens and farms located all across the city today.

63
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And these aren't plots of land

64
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where we're just growing tomatoes and carrots either.

65
0:03:51.64,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You understand, urban agriculture in Detroit is all about community,

66
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because we grow together.

67
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So these spaces are spaces of conviviality.

68
0:04:01.44,000 --> 0:04:04,000
These spaces are places where we're building social cohesion

69
0:04:05.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
as well as providing healthy, fresh food

70
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to our friends, our families and our neighbors.

71
0:04:13.2,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Come walk with me.

72
0:04:14.76,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I want to take you through a few Detroit neighborhoods,

73
0:04:17.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I want you to see what it looks like when you empower local leadership,

74
0:04:21.8,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and when you support grassroots movements

75
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of folks who are moving the needle in low-income communities

76
0:04:28.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and people of color.

77
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Our first stop, Oakland Avenue Farms.

78
0:04:33.24,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Oakland Avenue Farms is located in Detroit's North End neighborhood.

79
0:04:38.44,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Oakland Avenue Farms is transforming into a five-acre landscape

80
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
combining art, architecture, sustainable ecologies

81
0:04:47.28,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and new market practices.

82
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In the truest sense of the word,

83
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
this is what agriculture looks like in the city of Detroit.

84
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I've had the opportunity to work with Oakland Avenue Farms

85
0:05:00.68,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in hosting Detroit-grown and made farm-to-table dinners.

86
0:05:05.44,000 --> 0:05:08,000
These are dinners where we bring folks onto the farm,

87
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we give them plenty of time and opportunity

88
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to meet and greet and talk to the grower,

89
0:05:14.12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and then they're taken on a farm tour.

90
0:05:16.32,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And then afterwards, they're treated to a farm-to-table meal

91
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
prepared by a chef

92
0:05:24.08,000 --> 0:05:29,000
who showcases all the produce on the farm right at the peak of its freshness.

93
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We do that.

94
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We bring people onto the farm,

95
0:05:33.48,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we have folks sitting around a table,

96
0:05:35.72,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because we want to change people's relationship to food.

97
0:05:39.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We want them to know exactly where their food comes from

98
0:05:43.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that is grown on that farm that's on the plate.

99
0:05:47.2,000 --> 0:05:48,000
My second stop,

100
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I'm going to take you on the west side of Detroit,

101
0:05:51.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to the Brightmoor neighborhood.

102
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, Brightmoor is a lower-income community in Detroit.

103
0:05:56.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There's about 13,000 residents in Brightmoor.

104
0:06:00.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They decided to take a block-by-block-by-block strategy.

105
0:06:05.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So within the neighborhood of Brightmoor,

106
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you'll find a 21-block microneighborhood called Brightmoor Farmway.

107
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, what was a notorious, unsafe, underserved community

108
0:06:18.44,000 --> 0:06:22,000
has transformed into a welcoming, beautiful, safe farmway,

109
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
lush with parks and gardens and farms and greenhouses.

110
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This tight-knit community also came together recently,

111
0:06:30.96,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and they purchased an abandoned building,

112
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
an abandoned building that was in disrepair and in foreclosure.

113
0:06:37.84,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And with the help of friends and families and volunteers,

114
0:06:41.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they were able to take down the bulletproof glass,

115
0:06:43.8,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they were able to clean up the grounds

116
0:06:45.68,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and they transformed that building into a community kitchen,

117
0:06:49.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
into a cafe, into a storefront.

118
0:06:52.32,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now the farmers and the food artisans who live in Brightmoor,

119
0:06:56.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they have a place where they can make and sell their product.

120
0:06:59.24,000 --> 0:07:,000
And the people in the community

121
0:07:00.8,000 --> 0:07:03,000
have some place where they can buy healthy, fresh food.

122
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Urban agriculture -- and this is my third example --

123
0:07:07.36,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can be used as a way to lift up the business cooperative model.

124
0:07:12.96,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The 1,500 farms and gardens I told you about earlier?

125
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Keep Growing Detroit is a nonprofit organization

126
0:07:19.28,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that had a lot to do with those farms.

127
0:07:22.8,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They distributed last year 70,000 packets of seeds

128
0:07:27.8,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and a quarter of a million transplants,

129
0:07:31.36,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and as a result of that last year,

130
0:07:33.44,000 --> 0:07:36,000
550,000 pounds of produce

131
0:07:37.36,000 --> 0:07:4,000
was grown in the city of Detroit.

132
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

133
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But aside from all of that,

134
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they also manage and operate a cooperative.

135
0:07:52.52,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's called Grown in Detroit.

136
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It consists of about 70 farmers,

137
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:07:58,000
small farmers.

138
0:07:59.24,000 --> 0:08:02,000
They all grow, and they sell together.

139
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They grow fruits,

140
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they grow vegetables,

141
0:08:07.52,000 --> 0:08:08,000
they grow flowers,

142
0:08:09.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they grow herbs in healthy soil,

143
0:08:12.28,000 --> 0:08:14,000
free of chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers,

144
0:08:15.24,000 --> 0:08:17,000
genetically modified products --

145
0:08:17.6,000 --> 0:08:18,000
healthy food.

146
0:08:19.52,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And when their product is sold

147
0:08:21.56,000 --> 0:08:23,000
all over the city of Detroit in local markets,

148
0:08:24.44,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they get a hundred percent of the proceeds from the sale.

149
0:08:28.92,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In a city like Detroit,

150
0:08:31.32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where far too many, far too many African Americans are dying

151
0:08:36.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as a result of diet-related diseases,

152
0:08:40.4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
restaurants, they have a huge role to play

153
0:08:43.44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in increasing healthy food access in the city of Detroit,

154
0:08:46.88,000 --> 0:08:48,000
culturally appropriate restaurants.

155
0:08:49.32,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Enter Detroit Vegan Soul.

156
0:08:51.08,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Yes, we have a vegan soul food restaurant in the city of Detroit.

157
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

158
0:08:57.8,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Yes, yes.

159
0:09:00.2,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Detroit Vegan Soul is providing Detroiters the opportunity

160
0:09:04.28,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to eat more plant-based meals

161
0:09:07.72,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they've received an overwhelming response from Detroiters.

162
0:09:11.52,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Detroiters are hungry for culturally appropriate,

163
0:09:14.08,000 --> 0:09:15,000
fresh, delicious food.

164
0:09:16.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's why we built a nonprofit organization called FoodLab Detroit,

165
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to help small neighborhood burgeoning food entrepreneurs

166
0:09:23.6,000 --> 0:09:25,000
start and scale healthy food businesses.

167
0:09:26.84,000 --> 0:09:29,000
FoodLab provides these entrepreneurs incubation,

168
0:09:30.32,000 --> 0:09:32,000
hands-on education, workshops,

169
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
technical assistance, access to industry experts

170
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so that they can grow and scale.

171
0:09:38.6,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They're very small businesses,

172
0:09:40.08,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but last year, they had a combined revenue

173
0:09:43.36,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of over 7.5 million dollars,

174
0:09:45.92,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and they provided 252 jobs.

175
0:09:49.24,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Listen.

176
0:09:50.48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:53.28,000 --> 0:09:56,000
These are just a few examples

178
0:09:57.24,000 --> 0:10:,000
on how you expand opportunities

179
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so that everybody can participate

180
0:10:04.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and prosper,

181
0:10:06.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
particularly those who come from neighborhoods

182
0:10:10.12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that have been historically excluded from these types of opportunities.

183
0:10:14.88,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I know, I know.

184
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:2,000
My city is a long way from succeeding.

185
0:10:22.04,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We're still struggling,

186
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I'm not going to stand here on this stage and tell you

187
0:10:26.32,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that all of Detroit's problems and all of Detroit's challenges

188
0:10:29.76,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are going to be solved through urban agriculture.

189
0:10:32.72,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I'm not going to do that,

190
0:10:34.4,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but I will tell you this:

191
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
urban agriculture has Detroit thinking about its city

192
0:10:39.92,000 --> 0:10:4,000
now in a different way,

193
0:10:41.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
a city that can be both urban and rural.

194
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And yes, I know, these stories are small,

195
0:10:48.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
these stories are neighborhood-based stories,

196
0:10:51.56,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but these stories are powerful.

197
0:10:53.64,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They're powerful because I'm showing you how we're creating a new society

198
0:10:57.48,000 --> 0:11:02,000
left vacant in the places and the spaces that was disintegration from the old.

199
0:11:03.28,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They're powerful stories because they're stories about love,

200
0:11:06.64,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the love that Detroiters have for one another,

201
0:11:08.84,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the love that we have for our community, the love that we have for Mother Earth,

202
0:11:12.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but more importantly, these stories are stories

203
0:11:15.2,000 --> 0:11:2,000
on how devastation, despair, decay

204
0:11:20.24,000 --> 0:11:24,000
never ever get the last word in the city of Detroit.

205
0:11:25.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
When hundreds of thousands of people left Detroit,

206
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and they left us for dead, those who stayed had hope.

207
0:11:31.44,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They held on to hope.

208
0:11:33.24,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They never gave up.

209
0:11:34.56,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They always kept fighting.

210
0:11:37.2,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And listen, I know,

211
0:11:38.48,000 --> 0:11:41,000
transforming a big city like Detroit to one that is prosperous,

212
0:11:42.48,000 --> 0:11:44,000
one that's functional, one that's healthy,

213
0:11:44.96,000 --> 0:11:47,000
one that's inclusive, one that provides opportunities for all,

214
0:11:48.12,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I know it's tough,

215
0:11:49.68,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I know it's challenging, I know it's hard.

216
0:11:52.08,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But I just believe

217
0:11:54.08,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that if we start strengthening the social fabric of our communities,

218
0:11:57.68,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and if we kickstart economic opportunities in our most vulnerable neighborhoods,

219
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it all starts with healthy, accessible,

220
0:12:06.92,000 --> 0:12:1,000
delicious, culturally appropriate food.

221
0:12:11.12,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Thank you very much.

222
0:12:12.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

223
0:12:18.8,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Thank you.

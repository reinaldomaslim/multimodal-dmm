1
0:00:13.359,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Me Too and Time's Up have highlighted

2
0:00:16.64,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that harassment and discrimination are a shockingly common part

3
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of many people's lived reality,

4
0:00:23.08,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that this reality extends into the workplace.

5
0:00:26.88,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Whether in tech or finance, sports or the service industry,

6
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
every day we seem to hear another story about an abuse of power

7
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or another grossly inappropriate workplace behavior.

8
0:00:38.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
People are furious.

9
0:00:40.24,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They're taking to Twitter and social media to voice that this must change.

10
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But it's time to move beyond the hashtag.

11
0:00:47.88,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's time for us to report harassment and discrimination

12
0:00:51.4,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to those who can fix this mess.

13
0:00:53.6,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And it's time for us to talk about harassment

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in a more inclusive way:

15
0:00:58.12,000 --> 0:01:,000
not just about sexual harassment,

16
0:01:00.24,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but to encourage people to come forward

17
0:01:02.24,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about harassment and discrimination based on other characteristics

18
0:01:05.88,000 --> 0:01:07,000
such as age, disability or ethnicity.

19
0:01:09.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Because only together can we fix

20
0:01:11.92,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the underlying causes and consequences of harassment.

21
0:01:15.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You see, most of us will,

22
0:01:17.4,000 --> 0:01:18,000
at some point in our lives,

23
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:2,000
experience workplace harassment or discrimination.

24
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Research shows that particularly women, people of color

25
0:01:25.12,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and people who openly identify as LGBTQI are likely to be targeted,

26
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and for some people, this is a pervasive and persistent part of their reality.

27
0:01:34.52,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And for most of these people --

28
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:38,000
98 percent according to some studies --

29
0:01:39.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
most of these people will never speak up and tell their employer.

30
0:01:43.08,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Too often, harassment and discrimination is a lonely and isolating experience,

31
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but we need to help people out from under their desks.

32
0:01:51.04,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We need to empower people to have a voice.

33
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The reasonable first question that everybody asks

34
0:01:57.84,000 --> 0:02:,000
once they've been harassed is "What do I do now?"

35
0:02:00.88,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this is what I want to help you with.

36
0:02:03.76,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Navigating the barriers to reporting can be absolutely dizzying.

37
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
How can we speak up in a society

38
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that too often discredits or diminishes our experiences?

39
0:02:14.76,000 --> 0:02:16,000
How can we speak up in a society

40
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that is likely to be retributive towards us?

41
0:02:21.479,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How can we deal with the silencing that goes on all around us?

42
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Making matters worse,

43
0:02:29.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
often our memories are the only evidence we have of what happened.

44
0:02:34.44,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now, here's where I can come in.

45
0:02:36.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I'm a memory scientist,

46
0:02:37.64,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I specialize in how we remember important emotional events.

47
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I've particularly focused on how the memory interview process

48
0:02:45.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
can severely impact the evidentiary quality of reports that we produce.

49
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:54,000
A bad interview can lead you to forget details or misremember them

50
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
while a good interview can forever change your life for the better.

51
0:02:59.68,000 --> 0:03:02,000
After looking at lab reports and working,

52
0:03:03.44,000 --> 0:03:07,000
studying this issue both in the courtroom and in research settings,

53
0:03:07.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I've dissected all the different things that can go wrong with our memories

54
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that can really threaten your case.

55
0:03:14.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And now I'm turning my attention to helping people tackle

56
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
recording and reporting of workplace harassment and discrimination.

57
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There's three things that I've learned from my research on this

58
0:03:25.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that you can immediately apply

59
0:03:26.84,000 --> 0:03:29,000
if you've been harassed or discriminated against at work.

60
0:03:30.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I want to help you turn your memory into evidence --

61
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
evidence that even a memory skeptic like me

62
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is unlikely to find fault with.

63
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:41,000
First of all, James Comey had it right.

64
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The former head of the FBI used to sit in his car,

65
0:03:45.76,000 --> 0:03:47,000
lock himself in after meetings with the president

66
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and write down absolutely everything he could remember about what happened.

67
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The now-famous recordings proved to be quite useful later on.

68
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Be like Comey.

69
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now, you don't need to lock yourself into your car to do this,

70
0:04:01.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but please, immediately after something happens,

71
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I want you to contemporaneously record what happened.

72
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And do this before talking to anyone else about it.

73
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because as soon as your share your story

74
0:04:11.8,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with friends or family or colleagues or therapists,

75
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you have the potential to distort or change your memory of the event.

76
0:04:18.08,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Uncontaminated, contemporaneous evidence is worth gold.

77
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Second: the type of evidence matters.

78
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Sure, you can do a handwritten note of what happens,

79
0:04:28.76,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but how do you prove when you wrote it?

80
0:04:31.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Instead, pull out your computer or smartphone

81
0:04:33.76,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and make a note that's time-stamped,

82
0:04:36.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where you can prove this was recorded at this time.

83
0:04:39.6,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Contemporaneous, time-stamped evidence is better.

84
0:04:45.36,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Finally, make sure what you're writing down is actually relevant.

85
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Too often, we see that people bring out Facebook messages,

86
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they bring out time-stamped pieces of evidence,

87
0:04:56.92,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but sure, they're not particularly relevant,

88
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:,000
they're not particularly useful.

89
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's easy to write an emotional, unstructured account of what happened --

90
0:05:04.76,000 --> 0:05:07,000
understandable because it's an emotional experience --

91
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but those might not actually be the details that matter later on

92
0:05:11.4,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for an investigation.

93
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Write down this list.

94
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I want you to keep track of this and simply fill in the blanks.

95
0:05:20.36,000 --> 0:05:22,000
First of all, what happened?

96
0:05:22.4,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In as much detail as possible,

97
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
describe the situation,

98
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and do it on the day it happened if at all possible.

99
0:05:28.36,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Second, who was there?

100
0:05:29.88,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Were there any witnesses?

101
0:05:31.24,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This becomes crucial potentially later on.

102
0:05:33.84,000 --> 0:05:35,000
What exact time and date did this happen?

103
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What location? Where did this happen?

104
0:05:38.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Who did you tell after the event?

105
0:05:40.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
How did it make you feel during and after it happened?

106
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And is there any other evidence such as WhatsApps, photos or emails

107
0:05:48.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that might lend more credibility to your case.

108
0:05:52.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
These are all details that are incredibly easy to record contemporaneously

109
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but are also incredibly easy to forget later on.

110
0:05:58.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Humans, according to research, often overestimate their ability

111
0:06:02.92,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to remember important emotional details later on.

112
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Assume that you're going to forget.

113
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Assume you have to write it down.

114
0:06:11.92,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, these three pieces of advice are a good start,

115
0:06:15.44,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but of course they don't overcome a lot of the other barriers to reporting.

116
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission,

117
0:06:22.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
which published a report in 2018,

118
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:28,000
there's one key recommendation to overcome some of the other fears

119
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
often associated with reporting these kinds of incidents to your employer.

120
0:06:33.52,000 --> 0:06:34,000
One piece of advice that they made?

121
0:06:35.88,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Have an online, anonymous reporting tool.

122
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Only that way, they say,

123
0:06:40.68,000 --> 0:06:43,000
can you truly overcome many of the fears associated with reporting.

124
0:06:44.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, in line with this,

125
0:06:46.08,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and informed by what was happening all around me

126
0:06:49.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and taking and applying the memory science,

127
0:06:52.52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the science that I had been doing for many years,

128
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I sat down with a number of people

129
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:07:,000
and we together created TalkToSpot.com.

130
0:07:01.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Spot is an online, anonymous reporting tool

131
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that helps you record and report workplace harassment and discrimination.

132
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It allows you to do it anonymously,

133
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it allows you to do it for free,

134
0:07:11.2,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and it's completely evidence-based.

135
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You don't have to talk to a person,

136
0:07:14.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
there's no fear of judgment,

137
0:07:16.32,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and you can do it whenever and wherever you need.

138
0:07:21.04,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now you have the power to walk through an evidence-based memory interview.

139
0:07:26.8,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, this is called a cognitive interview.

140
0:07:28.88,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is the same technique that police use when they're doing their job properly.

141
0:07:33.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So in best-case scenarios,

142
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:37,000
people who are being asked about important emotional events

143
0:07:38.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
are being asked in line with the cognitive interview.

144
0:07:41.28,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, this walks you through all the relevant information

145
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so that at the end, after you've talked to the bot --

146
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which is an automatic messaging system --

147
0:07:51.52,000 --> 0:07:52,000
after you've talked to the bot,

148
0:07:53.04,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it generates a PDF record that's time-stamped and securely signed

149
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:08:,000
that you can keep for yourself as evidence in case you want to share it later,

150
0:08:00.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or you can submit it to your employer right away.

151
0:08:03.92,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And in line with recommendations,

152
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you can submit it to your employer anonymously.

153
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But a reporting tool is only as useful as the audience that's listening.

154
0:08:13.76,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So if your employer is truly committed to change,

155
0:08:16.64,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we've decided to also offer them the tool to respond.

156
0:08:20.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So if organizations work with us

157
0:08:23.36,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and are truly committed to doing something

158
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about workplace harassment and discrimination,

159
0:08:27.64,000 --> 0:08:31,000
they're also able to respond to you even if you've chosen to stay anonymous.

160
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We think it's important that you can work together with your employer

161
0:08:35.84,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to tackle this issue.

162
0:08:38.72,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We think that everybody wins when we bring light into this dark issue.

163
0:08:43.36,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Whether it happens to you or to someone you know,

164
0:08:46.039,000 --> 0:08:47,000
recording and reporting what happened

165
0:08:47.96,000 --> 0:08:51,000
can really improve how we talk about these issues.

166
0:08:52.08,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And if you're an organization,

167
0:08:53.559,000 --> 0:08:55,000
this is a call to give your employees access

168
0:08:56.32,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to better and more effective reporting mechanisms.

169
0:08:59.2,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We know that the current methods that are used in most organizations

170
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
don't work effectively.

171
0:09:06.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's time to change that if you're committed to inclusion and diversity.

172
0:09:13.48,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It's time for us to celebrate our diversity.

173
0:09:17.08,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's time for us to give a voice

174
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to those who have for too long been denied one.

175
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's time for us to celebrate those who come forward,

176
0:09:26.88,000 --> 0:09:28,000
even if they feel they need to stay anonymous --

177
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to stay masked to do so.

178
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's time for a reporting revolution.

179
0:09:34.6,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Thank you.

180
0:09:35.96,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

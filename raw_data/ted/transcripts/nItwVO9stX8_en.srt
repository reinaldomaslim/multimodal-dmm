1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Both myself and my brother

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
belong to the under 30 demographic,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which Pat said makes 70 percent,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but according to our statistics

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
it makes 60 percent of the region's population.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Qatar is no exception to the region.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's a very young nation led by young people.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the iPods,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and for me the abaya,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now this is not a religious garment,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
nor is it a religious statement.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we choose to wear.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now I remember a few years ago,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
president of Qatar University --

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who, by the way, is a woman --

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
he asked her whether she thought

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Her answer was quite the contrary.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Instead, she felt more free,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
more free because she could wear whatever she wanted

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
under the abaya.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Not that you do; I'm just saying.

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
My point is here, people have a choice --

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
just like the Indian lady could wear her sari

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We are changing our culture from within,

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but at the same time

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we are reconnecting with our traditions.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We know that modernization is happening.

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.

38
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But at the same time

39
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's important for us to grow organically.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And we continuously make the conscious decision

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to reach that balance.

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In fact, research has shown

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that the more the world is flat,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
if I use Tom Friedman's analogy,

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or global,

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the more and more people are wanting to be different.

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And for us young people,

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they're looking to become individuals

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and find their differences amongst themselves.

51
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of globalizing the local

53
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and localizing the global.

54
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We don't want to be all the same,

55
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but we want to respect each other and understand each other.

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And therefore tradition becomes more important,

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
not less important.

58
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Life necessitates a universal world,

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
however, we believe in the security

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of having a local identity.

61
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And this is what the leaders of this region

62
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
are trying to do.

63
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We're trying to be part of this global village,

64
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but at the same time we're revising ourselves

65
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
through our cultural institutions and cultural development.

66
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm a representation of that phenomenon.

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I think a lot of people in this room,

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.

69
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
they are in the same position.

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We're continuously trying to straddle

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
different worlds, different cultures

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and trying to meet the challenges

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of a different expectation

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
from ourselves and from others.

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So I want to ask a question:

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What should culture in the 21st century look like?

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In a time where the world is becoming personalized,

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
everything has its own personal identity,

81
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
how should we perceive ourselves

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and how should we perceive others?

83
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How does that impact our desert culture?

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
opened in Qatar in 2008.

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but I also understand

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that this has to be done organically.

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in order to develop new cultural institutions,

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but what I think is more important

94
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is that we are very fortunate

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to have visionary leaders

96
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who understand that this can't happen from outside,

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it has to come from within.

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And guess what?

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who are leading these cultural initiatives

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
happen to be women.

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Is it because it's a soft option;

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we have nothing else to do?

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No, I don't think so.

106
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I think that women in this part of the world

107
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
realize that culture is an important component

108
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to connect people

109
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
both locally and regionally.

110
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's a natural component

111
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for bringing people together, discussing ideas --

112
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in the same way we're doing here at TED.

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We're here, we're part of a community,

114
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
sharing out ideas and discussing them.

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Art becomes a very important part

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of our national identity.

117
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The existential and social and political impact

118
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
an artist has

119
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
on his nation's development of cultural identity

120
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is very important.

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You know, art and culture is big business.

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Ask me.

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of Sotheby's and Christie's.

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.

126
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
They make a lot of money.

127
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So I think women in our society

128
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
are becoming leaders,

129
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because they realize

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that for their future generations,

131
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it's very important

132
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to maintain our cultural identities.

133
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Why else do Greeks demand the return

134
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of the Elgin Marbles?

135
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And why is there an uproar

136
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
when a private collector tries to sell his collection

137
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to a foreign museum?

138
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Why does it take me months on end

139
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to get an export license from London or New York

140
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in order to get pieces into my country?

141
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran

142
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who's a very important artist for us

143
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
will be talking to you.

144
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.

145
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Instead, she tries to engage

146
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in a very important dialogue

147
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
about her culture, nation and heritage.

148
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
She does that through important visual forms

149
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of photography and film.

150
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums

151
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
through an organic process from within.

152
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.

153
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We don't want to have what there is in the West.

154
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We don't want their collections.

155
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,

156
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
create an open dialogue

157
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so that we share our ideas

158
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and share yours with us.

159
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In a few days,

160
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.

161
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We have done extensive research

162
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,

163
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and Arabs who are not Muslims --

164
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --

165
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but we make sure that they are represented

166
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in this new institution.

167
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This institution is government-backed

168
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it has been the case

169
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for the past three decades.

170
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We will open the museum in a few days,

171
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways

172
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and come and join us.

173
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

174
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.

175
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Some of you might have heard

176
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,

177
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but I doubt a lot of people know

178
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that this artist worked in Picasso's studio

179
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in Paris in the 1930s.

180
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
For me it was a new discovery.

181
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I think with time, in the years to come

182
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,

183
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
our Legers and our Cezannes.

184
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We do have artists,

185
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.

186
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now visual expression is just one form

187
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of culture integration.

188
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We have realized that recently

189
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
more and more people

190
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
are using the means of YouTube and social networking

191
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to express their stories, share their photos

192
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and tell their own stories through their own voices.

193
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In a similar way,

194
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we have created the Doha Film Institute.

195
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization

196
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to teach people about film and filmmaking.

197
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.

198
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Today I am proud to say

199
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we have trained and educated

200
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
over 66 Qatari women filmmakers

201
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to edit, tell their own stories

202
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in their own voices.

203
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Applause)

204
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film

205
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that has proven to show

206
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku

207
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in telling a big picture.

208
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And this is one of our filmmakers' products.

209
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?

210
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Who are you playing?

211
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.

212
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.

214
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)

215
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Play by yourself then.

216
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.

217
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Useless.

218
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you. Thank you!

219
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
SM: Going back to straddling between East and West,

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
here in Doha.

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It attracted 42,000 people,

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we showcased 51 films.

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is not an imported festival,

229
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but rather an important festival

230
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
between the cities of New York and Doha.

231
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's important for two things.

232
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
First, it allows us to showcase

233
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
our Arab filmmakers and voices

234
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,

235
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
New York City.

236
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
At the same time, we are inviting them

237
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to come and explore our part of the world.

238
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage

239
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and realizing we're just as different

240
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and just the same as each other.

241
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now over and over again,

242
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
people have said, "Let's build bridges,"

243
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and frankly, I want to do more than that.

244
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I would like break the walls of ignorance

245
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
between East and West --

246
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
no, not the soft option that we have discussed before,

247
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but rather the soft power

248
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.

250
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We should not underestimate it.

251
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"Know thyself,"

252
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization

253
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that we are traveling.

254
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers,

255
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but I know that me as an individual

256
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and we as a nation

257
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
welcome this community

258
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of ideas worth spreading.

259
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is a very interesting journey.

260
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I welcome you on board

261
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
for us to engage and discuss new ideas

262
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
of how to bring people together

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
through cultural initiatives and discussions.

264
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.

265
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.

266
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

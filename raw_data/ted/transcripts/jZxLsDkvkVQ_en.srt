1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How are we going to introduce her?"

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I said, "I think she's dancing."

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I could see everybody looked at me,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
somebody said, "Bollywood."

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the third said, "Let's find another director."

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I thought I had better change.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What are you talking about?"

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I rethought the whole thing,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and then we all came to a consensus.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And here was the introduction of this

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
great British icon called "Elizabeth."

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Leicester: May I join you, my lady?

22
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.

23
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Music)

24
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.

25
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So how many people who saw the film did not get

26
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that here was a woman in love,

27
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that she was completely innocent

28
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?

29
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And how many of you did not get that?

30
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's the power of visual storytelling,

31
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:

32
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the power of not knowing.

33
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When I go out to direct a film,

34
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
every day we prepare too much, we think too much.

35
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.

36
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You know, simple words lost

37
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the quicksand of experience.

38
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So I come up, and I say,

39
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,

40
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I put myself into absolute panic.

41
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,

42
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
getting rid of this mind that says,

43
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.

44
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You're a director, you've done it for years."

45
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I've got to get there

46
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and be in complete panic.

47
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,

48
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I go and I panic myself, I get scared.

49
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,

50
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.

51
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,

52
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."

53
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the studio executives, they would say,

54
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."

55
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan

56
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because he's chaotic.

57
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'm allowing myself to go into chaos

58
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.

59
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
All preparation is preparation.

60
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I don't even know if it's honest.

61
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I don't even know if it's truthful.

62
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,

63
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and if you get five great moments

64
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of great, organic stuff

65
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in your storytelling, in your film,

66
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
your film, audiences will get it.

67
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there

68
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and saying, "I don't know what to say."

69
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,

70
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
200 people at seven in the morning

71
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,

72
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and everybody's saying,

73
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"

74
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And you put yourself into a state of panic

75
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where you don't know, and so you don't know.

76
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And so, because you don't know,

77
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe

78
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe

79
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the way Einstein -- say a prayer --

80
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
accessed his equations,

81
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the same source. I'm looking for the same source

82
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because creativity comes from absolutely the same source

83
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that you meditate somewhere outside yourself,

84
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
outside the universe.

85
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You're looking for something that comes and hits you.

86
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.

87
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So what do you do?

88
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"

89
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)

90
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --

91
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
why don't you show me what you want to do?"

92
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.

94
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm trying to buy time.

95
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,

96
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I follow all the time is: Panic.

97
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Panic is the great access of creativity

98
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because that's the only way to get rid of your mind.

99
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Get rid of your mind.

100
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Get out of it, get it out.

101
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And let's go to the universe because

102
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
there's something out there that is more

103
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
truthful than your mind,

104
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that is more truthful than your universe.

105
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it

106
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because that's what I follow constantly

107
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.

108
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.

109
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So that's what I do.

110
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
When I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.

111
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You remember how India was. There was no pollution.

112
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.

113
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --

114
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and we used to sleep out at night.

115
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
At school I was being just taught about physics,

116
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and I was told that

117
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
if there is something that exists,

118
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
then it is measurable.

119
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
If it is not measurable,

120
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it does not exist.

121
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,

122
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,

123
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I used to stare at the universe and say,

124
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"How far does this universe go?"

125
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
My father was a doctor.

126
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"

127
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."

128
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So I said, "Please measure forever

129
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because in school they're teaching me

130
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It doesn't come into my frame of reference."

132
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, how far does eternity go?

133
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What does forever mean?

134
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And I would lie there crying at night

135
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because my imagination could not touch creativity.

136
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So what did I do?

137
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
At that time, at the tender age of seven,

138
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I created a story.

139
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What was my story?

140
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.

141
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There was a woodcutter

142
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,

143
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.

144
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And when that ax hits that piece of wood,

145
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that's when everything will destroy

146
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the Big Bang will happen again.

147
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But all before that there was a woodcutter.

148
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And then when I would run out of that story,

149
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I would imagine that woodcutter's universe

150
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.

151
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So every time, I could tell my story again and again

152
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and get over this problem,

153
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and so I got over the problem.

154
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
How did I do it? Tell a story.

155
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So what is a story?

156
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
A story is our -- all of us --

157
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we are the stories we tell ourselves.

158
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In this universe, and this existence,

159
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
where we live with this duality

160
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of whether we exist or not

161
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and who are we,

162
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the stories we tell ourselves are the stories

163
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that define the potentialities

164
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of our existence.

165
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We are the stories we tell ourselves.

166
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So that's as wide as we look at stories.

167
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
A story is the relationship

168
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that you develop between who you are,

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
or who you potentially are,

170
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.

171
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We tell our stories,

172
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and a person without a story does not exist.

173
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So Einstein told a story

174
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and followed his stories and came up with theories

175
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.

176
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,

177
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and he went out to conquer the world.

178
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.

179
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We tell ourselves stories.

180
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So, I will go further, and I say,

181
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."

182
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I exist because there are stories,

183
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and if there are no stories, we don't exist.

184
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We create stories to define our existence.

185
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If we do not create the stories,

186
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we probably go mad.

187
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.

188
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now, a film.

189
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
A film tells a story.

190
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --

191
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements

192
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that are given to a director --

193
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --

194
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
would we get Buddhism better?

195
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But that puts some kind of burden on me.

196
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I have to tell a story

197
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in a much more elaborate way,

198
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but I have the potential.

199
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's called subtext.

200
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
When I first went to Hollywood, they said --

201
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,

202
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"

203
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film

204
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
if you talk about subtext.

205
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Just talk about plot

206
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,

207
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
what the visuals will be."

208
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So when I look at a film,

209
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
here's what we look for:

210
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We look for a story on the plot level,

211
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
then we look for a story

212
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
on the psychological level,

213
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
then we look for a story on the political level,

214
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
then we look at a story

215
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
on a mythological level.

216
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And I look for stories on each level.

217
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, it is not necessary

218
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that these stories agree with each other.

219
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What is wonderful is,

220
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.

221
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,

222
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.

223
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Find that which is not.

224
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Find the truth for yourself,

225
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and when you find the truth for yourself,

226
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,

227
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but don't worry about it."

228
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."

229
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that

230
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the writer was telling:

231
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
A woman who was threatened

232
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
by Philip II

233
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and was going to war,

234
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.

235
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,

236
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,

237
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and then Walter Raleigh

238
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
fell in love with her lady in waiting,

239
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war

240
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
or she wanted...

241
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Here's the story I was telling:

242
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The gods up there,

243
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
there were two people.

244
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
There was Philip II, who was divine

245
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
because he was always praying,

246
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,

247
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,

248
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.

249
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But the divine one was unjust,

250
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so the gods said,

251
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"OK, what we need to do is

252
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
help the just one."

253
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so they helped the just one.

254
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down

255
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to physically separate her mortal self

256
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from her spirit self.

257
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And the mortal self was the girl

258
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that Walter Raleigh was sent,

259
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and gradually he separated her

260
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
so she was free to be divine.

261
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the two divine people fought,

262
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the gods were on the side of divinity.

263
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Of course, all the British press got really upset.

264
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
They said, "We won the Armada."

265
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But I said, "But the storm won the Armada.

266
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The gods sent the storm."

267
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So what was I doing?

268
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I was trying to find a mythic reason

269
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to make the film.

270
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"

271
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
She said, "The film's about a woman

272
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
coming to terms with growing older."

273
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Psychological.

274
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The writer said "It's about history, plot."

275
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I said "It's about mythology,

276
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the gods."

277
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So let me show you a film --

278
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
a piece from that film --

279
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and how a camera also --

280
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
so this is a scene, where in my mind,

281
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
she was at the depths of mortality.

282
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
She was discovering what mortality actually means,

283
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and if she is at the depths of mortality,

284
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
what really happens.

285
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality

286
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and why she should break away from mortality.

287
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Remember, in the film, to me,

288
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
both her and her lady in waiting

289
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
were parts of the same body,

290
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
one the mortal self

291
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and one the spirit self.

292
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So can we have that second?

293
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Music)

294
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Elizabeth: Bess?

295
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Bess?

296
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Bess Throckmorton?

297
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Bess: Here, my lady.

298
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true?

299
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Are you with child?

300
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Are you with child?

301
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Bess: Yes, my lady.

302
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Elizabeth: Traitorous.

303
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
You dare to keep secrets from me?

304
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You ask my permission before you rut,

305
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
before you breed.

306
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
My bitches wear my collars.

307
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

308
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.

309
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.

310
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.

311
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Is it his?

312
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?

313
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Bess: Yes.

314
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
My lady,

315
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
it is my husband's child.

316
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)

317
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Raleigh: Majesty.

318
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is not the queen I love and serve.

319
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,

320
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and she has married without royal consent.

321
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.

322
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Go.

323
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
You no longer have the queen's protection.

324
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Bess: As you wish, Majesty.

325
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!

326
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Get out.

327
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Music)

328
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?

329
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Elizabeth has realized,

330
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and she's coming face-to-face

331
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
with her own sense of jealousy,

332
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
her own sense of mortality.

333
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
What am I doing with the architecture?

334
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The architecture is telling a story.

335
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
The architecture is telling a story

336
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
about how, even though she's the most powerful woman

337
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
in the world at that time,

338
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
there is the other, the architecture's bigger.

339
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.

340
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It'll survive her.

341
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.

342
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?

343
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.

344
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
She's in the absolute well

345
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
of her own sense of being mortal.

346
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
That's where she has to pull herself out

347
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
from the depths of mortality,

348
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
come in, release her spirit.

349
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And that's the moment where, in my mind,

350
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.

351
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
But that's the moment

352
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
she's surgically removing herself from that.

353
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So the film is operating on

354
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
many many levels in that scene.

355
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And how we tell stories

356
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
visually, with music, with actors,

357
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and at each level it's a different sense

358
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and sometimes contradictory to each other.

359
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So how do I start all this?

360
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
What's the process of telling a story?

361
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
About ten years ago,

362
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I heard this little thing from a politician,

363
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
not a politician that was very well respected in India.

364
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And he said that these people in the cities,

365
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
in one flush, expend as much water

366
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
as you people in the rural areas

367
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
don't get for your family for two days.

368
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."

369
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I went to see a friend of mine,

370
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and he made me wait

371
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in his apartment in Malabar Hill

372
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
on the twentieth floor,

373
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.

374
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.

375
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
I got bored and left, and as I drove out,

376
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I drove past the slums of Bombay,

377
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
as you always do,

378
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun

379
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
of women and children with buckets

380
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
waiting for a tanker

381
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
to come and give them water.

382
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And an idea started to develop.

383
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
So how does that become a story?

384
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.

385
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
So my next film is called "Paani"

386
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
which means water.

387
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And now, out of the mythology of that,

388
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I'm starting to create a world.

389
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
What kind of world do I create,

390
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and where does the idea, the design of that come?

391
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So, in my mind, in the future,

392
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
they started to build flyovers.

393
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
You understand flyovers? Yeah?

394
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
They started to build flyovers

395
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to get from A to B faster,

396
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth

397
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
to another area of relative wealth.

398
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And then what they did was

399
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
they created a city above the flyovers.

400
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
And the rich people moved to the upper city

401
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and left the poorer people in the lower cities,

402
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
about 10 to 12 percent of the people

403
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
have moved to the upper city.

404
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?

405
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
There's a mythology in India about --

406
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,

407
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
[Hindi]

408
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Right. What does that mean?

409
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders

410
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and survive on the shoulders of the poor.

411
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.

412
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
So the design has a story.

413
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,

414
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
they suck up all the water.

415
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Remember the word I said, suck up.

416
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,

417
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and they drip feed the lower city.

418
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.

419
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And, because democracy still exists,

420
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
there's a democratic way in which you say

421
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."

422
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
So, okay my time is up.

423
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
But I can go on about telling you

424
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
how we evolve stories,

425
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and how stories effectively are who we are

426
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and how these get translated into the particular discipline

427
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
that I am in, which is film.

428
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.

429
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Everything's a contradiction.

430
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
The universe is a contradiction.

431
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.

432
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.

433
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
But you get up at 4 a.m.

434
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
That first blush of blue is where the night and day

435
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
are trying to find harmony with each other.

436
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,

437
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.

438
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.

439
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
It's the effect of looking for harmony

440
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,

441
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.

442
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.

443
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,

444
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
in the universe's mind, between day and night.

445
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
In the mind of a man and a woman,

446
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
we're looking constantly at

447
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
the contradiction between male and female,

448
0:20:10.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
we're looking for harmony within each other.

449
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The whole idea of contradiction,

450
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
but the acceptance of contradiction

451
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
is the telling of a story, not the resolution.

452
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood

453
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,

454
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
that we try to resolve the contradiction.

455
0:20:28.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Harmony is not resolution.

456
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing

457
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
that is much larger than resolution.

458
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
Harmony is the suggestion of something

459
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
that is embracing and universal

460
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
and of eternity and of the moment.

461
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Resolution is something that is far more limited.

462
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
It is finite; harmony is infinite.

463
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:51,000
So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,

464
0:20:51.26,000 --> 0:20:54,000
is looking for harmony and infinity

465
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,

466
0:20:57.26,000 --> 0:21:01,000
letting another go and creating a question that is really important.

467
0:21:01.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Thank you very much.

468
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Applause)

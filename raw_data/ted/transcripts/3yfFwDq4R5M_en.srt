1
0:00:12.746,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today, I want to talk to you about dreams.

2
0:00:15.999,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,

3
0:00:18.74,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and it's cooler than in the movies.

4
0:00:20.74,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.707,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Beyond flying, breathing fire,

6
0:00:25.439,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and making hot men spontaneously appear ...

7
0:00:28.304,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:30.305,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I can do things like read and write music.

9
0:00:33.344,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college

10
0:00:36.699,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in a dream.

11
0:00:38.043,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I did accepted. So, yeah.

12
0:00:41.873,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I am a very visual thinker.

13
0:00:44.393,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I think in pictures, not words.

14
0:00:47.174,000 --> 0:00:51,000
To me, words are more like instincts and language.

15
0:00:51.993,000 --> 0:00:52,000
There are many people like me;

16
0:00:53.769,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Nikola Tesla, for example,

17
0:00:56.307,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything --

18
0:01:01.346,000 --> 0:01:04,000
all of his inventions -- in his mind, accurately.

19
0:01:06.633,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway.

20
0:01:09.999,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I am a bit more primitive,

21
0:01:12.133,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like a beta version of Google Translate.

22
0:01:14.725,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:18.741,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me.

24
0:01:23.307,000 --> 0:01:25,000
For example, once I had an affair with calculus

25
0:01:25.998,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages.

26
0:01:28.711,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:32.527,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There are some other unusual things about me.

28
0:01:36.391,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection

29
0:01:39.241,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in my voice.

30
0:01:40.479,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That's why people often confuse me with a GPS.

31
0:01:43.564,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:48.034,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions.

33
0:01:52.005,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:56.444,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Thank you.

35
0:01:57.642,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Applause)

36
0:02:02.6,000 --> 0:02:05,000
A few years ago, when I started doing presentations,

37
0:02:05.863,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I went to get head shots done for the first time.

38
0:02:09.381,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The photographer told me to look flirty.

39
0:02:12.148,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:14.441,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I had no idea what she was talking about.

41
0:02:17.054,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:18.724,000 --> 0:02:2,000
She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes,

43
0:02:21.176,000 --> 0:02:22,000
when you're flirting with guys."

44
0:02:23.101,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"What thing?" I asked.

45
0:02:25.608,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"You know, squint."

46
0:02:27.553,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And so I tried, really.

47
0:02:29.261,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It looked something like this.

48
0:02:31.382,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33.867,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I looked like I was searching for Waldo.

50
0:02:36.514,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:40.582,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There's a reason for this,

52
0:02:42.338,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.

53
0:02:44.931,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:52.918,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I have Asperger's,

55
0:02:54.53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a high-functioning form of autism

56
0:02:56.546,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display.

57
0:03:02.726,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's made life difficult in many ways,

58
0:03:05.834,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially.

59
0:03:09.955,000 --> 0:03:12,000
My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them.

60
0:03:14.32,000 --> 0:03:18,000
My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert --

61
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and they taught me humor.

62
0:03:22.881,000 --> 0:03:25,000
My personality switched from being shy and awkward

63
0:03:26.711,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to being defiant and cursing out a storm.

64
0:03:30.322,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Needless to say, I did not have many friends.

65
0:03:33.714,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was also hypersensitive to texture.

66
0:03:36.722,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles,

67
0:03:40.433,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and so for years, I refused to shower.

68
0:03:43.251,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though.

69
0:03:47.243,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:50.487,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents --

71
0:03:54.904,000 --> 0:03:58,000
things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,

72
0:03:59.557,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse.

73
0:04:05.27,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment,

74
0:04:10.857,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but within days of them prescribing a new medication,

75
0:04:14.555,000 --> 0:04:16,000
my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead.

76
0:04:18.109,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate

77
0:04:21.245,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that rotting corpses were coming towards me.

78
0:04:24.769,000 --> 0:04:26,000
My family finally rescued me,

79
0:04:27.635,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks,

80
0:04:32.348,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as well as developing severe anemia,

81
0:04:34.801,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and was on the verge of suicide.

82
0:04:38.18,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions,

83
0:04:42.879,000 --> 0:04:45,000
my trauma, and my social anxiety,

84
0:04:46.584,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed.

85
0:04:50.202,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And after 18 months of hard work,

86
0:04:52.798,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I went on to do incredible things.

87
0:04:56.71,000 --> 0:04:59,000
One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes,

88
0:05:00.162,000 --> 0:05:02,000
these people have a very complex inner life,

89
0:05:02.279,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality,

90
0:05:05.144,000 --> 0:05:08,000
rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.

91
0:05:08.872,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But there's a gap between where that stands,

92
0:05:12.269,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and how I communicate it with the rest of the world.

93
0:05:15.416,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And this can make basic communication a challenge.

94
0:05:20.106,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills,

95
0:05:23.389,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which is why I applied to Waffle House.

96
0:05:25.713,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:32.07,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner --

98
0:05:35.772,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:37.749,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Applause)

100
0:05:41.027,000 --> 0:05:42,000
thank you --

101
0:05:42.991,000 --> 0:05:43,000
where you can order your hash browns

102
0:05:44.774,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ...

103
0:05:47.951,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:49.608,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered.

105
0:05:54.361,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:56.488,000 --> 0:05:57,000
As social norms would have it,

107
0:05:57.957,000 --> 0:06:,000
you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night.

108
0:06:01.478,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

109
0:06:02.653,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her,

110
0:06:07.033,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?"

111
0:06:10.873,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked.

112
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:15.754,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I said, "Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!"

114
0:06:18.286,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:20.914,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me.

116
0:06:25.838,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage,

117
0:06:30.242,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt,

118
0:06:32.433,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but it's also the opposite.

119
0:06:34.211,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively.

120
0:06:38.81,000 --> 0:06:44,000
At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs,

121
0:06:45.664,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I ended up speaking

122
0:06:47.203,000 --> 0:06:49,000
at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity,

123
0:06:49.478,000 --> 0:06:5,000
presenting this research.

124
0:06:50.998,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Applause)

125
0:06:52.71,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Thank you.

126
0:06:53.892,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Applause)

127
0:06:58.814,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college,

128
0:07:02.833,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees.

129
0:07:08.275,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

130
0:07:09.307,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Thank you.

131
0:07:10.586,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:13.287,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But consider what I had to do to get here:

133
0:07:16.495,000 --> 0:07:21,000
25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma.

134
0:07:22.698,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way,

135
0:07:25.793,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I think there is: autism-assistive technology.

136
0:07:30.503,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This technology could play an integral role

137
0:07:32.544,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder,

138
0:07:35.423,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or ASD.

139
0:07:38.465,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees,

140
0:07:43.455,000 --> 0:07:48,000
has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills.

141
0:07:49.324,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera

142
0:07:53.67,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience.

143
0:08:00.561,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me,

144
0:08:03.142,000 --> 0:08:05,000
after practicing on it some more.

145
0:08:05.346,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

146
0:08:09.162,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And one of the great things is that I've used Podium

147
0:08:14.705,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help.

148
0:08:19.815,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But it's more than that.

149
0:08:21.466,000 --> 0:08:22,000
There's more that can be done.

150
0:08:24.274,000 --> 0:08:27,000
For people with ASD --

151
0:08:27.39,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it has been speculated that many innovative scientists,

152
0:08:31.931,000 --> 0:08:35,000
researchers, artists, and engineers have it;

153
0:08:36.546,000 --> 0:08:42,000
like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates

154
0:08:42.6,000 --> 0:08:43,000
are some examples.

155
0:08:44.361,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But the problem that's encountered

156
0:08:46.138,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared

157
0:08:49.999,000 --> 0:08:51,000
if there are communication roadblocks.

158
0:08:53.249,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day,

159
0:08:57.999,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they're being taken advantage of.

160
0:09:01.175,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So my dream for people with autism is to change that,

161
0:09:08.094,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding.

162
0:09:11.808,000 --> 0:09:13,000
One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming

163
0:09:14.334,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is because it allows me to be free,

164
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
without judgment of social and physical consequences.

165
0:09:21.638,000 --> 0:09:24,000
When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind,

166
0:09:24.664,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I am at peace.

167
0:09:27.346,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I am free from judgment,

168
0:09:29.39,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and so I can do whatever I want, you know?

169
0:09:31.43,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it.

170
0:09:36.358,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:39.759,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that,

172
0:09:43.682,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and more important.

173
0:09:45.725,000 --> 0:09:48,000
My goal is to shift people's perspective

174
0:09:49.67,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's

175
0:09:54.674,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because there is a lot they can do.

176
0:09:58.562,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example.

177
0:10:02.022,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world

178
0:10:07.141,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and move this world forward.

179
0:10:09.532,000 --> 0:10:12,000
In addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams

180
0:10:12.778,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in the real world, in real time.

181
0:10:15.09,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Thank you.

182
0:10:16.273,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Applause)

183
0:10:19.945,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Thank you.

184
0:10:21.12,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.583,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

2
0:00:20.623,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I don't sleep that much,

3
0:00:21.837,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much

4
0:00:24.584,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as being a great virtue,

5
0:00:25.914,000 --> 0:00:26,000
after years of kind of battling it

6
0:00:27.595,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as being a terrible detriment or something.

7
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And now I really like sort of sitting up.

8
0:00:32.59,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You know, but for years, I've been sitting up,

9
0:00:34.769,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and I think my creativity is greatly motivated

10
0:00:40.09,000 --> 0:00:41,000
by this kind of insomnia.

11
0:00:41.765,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly sometimes.

12
0:00:46.064,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I used to walk more at night.

13
0:00:47.921,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I walk during the day, and I follow people who I think look interesting.

14
0:00:52.036,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:54.082,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And sometimes -- actually, once it was on "Page Six" in the "Post"

16
0:00:58.752,000 --> 0:01:,000
that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,

17
0:01:01.375,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but I was actually just following because he had these great shoes on --

18
0:01:04.876,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:05.904,000 --> 0:01:06,000
so I was following this guy.

20
0:01:07.282,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I took a picture of his shoes,

21
0:01:08.945,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we thanked each other and just went on our way.

22
0:01:11.367,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But I do that all the time.

23
0:01:12.683,000 --> 0:01:15,000
As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas

24
0:01:15.79,000 --> 0:01:18,000
come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.

25
0:01:19.806,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,

26
0:01:23.726,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so many clothes out there.

27
0:01:25.94,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the only ones that look interesting to me

28
0:01:28.616,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,

29
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or very, very surprising.

30
0:01:34.204,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And often, I'm driving in a taxi,

31
0:01:36.515,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting

32
0:01:40.25,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or pretty or functional

33
0:01:41.773,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in some way that I'd never seen happen before.

34
0:01:44.956,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk

35
0:01:49.267,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and see that, in fact, there wasn't a hole,

36
0:01:51.613,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but it was a trick of my eye; it was a shadow, you know.

37
0:01:54.392,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Or if there was a hole, I'd think like, "Oh, damn.

38
0:01:56.822,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Actually, someone thought of that thought already.

39
0:01:59.208,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Someone made that mistake already, so I can't do it anymore."

40
0:02:02.163,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I don't know where inspiration comes from.

41
0:02:05.057,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It does not come, for me, from research.

42
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I don't get necessarily inspired by research.

43
0:02:11.767,000 --> 0:02:12,000
As a matter of fact,

44
0:02:12.942,000 --> 0:02:14,000
one of the most fun things I've ever done in my whole life

45
0:02:15.859,000 --> 0:02:17,000
was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.

46
0:02:18.807,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard,

47
0:02:22.751,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I did, like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.

48
0:02:25.399,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I saw this really smart critic who I love,

49
0:02:27.804,000 --> 0:02:29,000
this woman Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine.

50
0:02:30.126,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And she came backstage and said,

51
0:02:31.686,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"Oh, Isaac, did you know that -- talk to me about Stalinism

52
0:02:34.979,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and talk to me about, you know, like, the '30s in Russia."

53
0:02:37.742,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I thought, "How do I know about Stalinism?"

54
0:02:40.297,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I know about a wolf and a bird,

55
0:02:42.344,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and, you know, he ate the bird,

56
0:02:43.97,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and then in the end, you know, you hear the bird squeaking or something.

57
0:02:47.427,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:48.462,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I don't really know that, I don't really --

59
0:02:50.69,000 --> 0:02:52,000
actually, I do my own kind of research, you know?

60
0:02:53.186,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera

61
0:02:56.691,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or something like that,

62
0:02:58.117,000 --> 0:03:,000
I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,

63
0:03:00.749,000 --> 0:03:02,000
not because it's what I'm supposed to do.

64
0:03:03.59,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.

65
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors.

66
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Light from behind the projection or light from the projection

67
0:03:14.638,000 --> 0:03:16,000
makes the colors look so impossible.

68
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Anyway, roll this little clip. I'll just show you.

69
0:03:20.239,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I sit up at night, and I watch movies,

70
0:03:23.738,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I watch women in movies a lot.

71
0:03:26.032,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I think about, you know, their roles

72
0:03:29.17,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.

73
0:03:33.515,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time,

74
0:03:36.928,000 --> 0:03:39,000
whether they're kind of glorified in this way,

75
0:03:40.02,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,

76
0:03:45.691,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or whether they're sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated.

77
0:03:51.171,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I go back to color all the time.

78
0:03:53.123,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Color is something that motivates me a lot.

79
0:03:58.495,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's rarely color that I find in nature,

80
0:04:02.994,000 --> 0:04:06,000
although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,

81
0:04:07.98,000 --> 0:04:09,000
natural color is so beautiful.

82
0:04:10.742,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So that's what I do. I study color a lot.

83
0:04:13.471,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything

84
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?

85
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?

86
0:04:27.449,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I mean, that's just not possible. You know?

87
0:04:30.766,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess.

88
0:04:35.474,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I'm also like a big --

89
0:04:39.59,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,

90
0:04:42.698,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and that's another thing that motivates me a lot.

91
0:04:45.02,000 --> 0:04:48,000
People say, "Do that" -- an astrologer tells me to do something,

92
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so I do it.

93
0:04:49.505,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:50.531,000 --> 0:04:53,000
When I was about 21, an astrologer told me

95
0:04:54.446,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that I was going to meet the man of my dreams,

96
0:04:56.625,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and that his name was going to be Eric, right?

97
0:04:59.065,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, you know, for years I would go to bars

98
0:05:01.583,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric,

99
0:05:03.842,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I was humping immediately or something.

100
0:05:05.937,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:08.266,000 --> 0:05:09,000
There were times when I was so desperate,

102
0:05:10.256,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I would just walk into a room and go, "Eric?"

103
0:05:12.383,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And anybody who would turn around, I would make a beeline for.

104
0:05:15.353,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:16.468,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.

106
0:05:19.724,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny,

107
0:05:22.897,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was this guy in, like, a straw boater with a cane

108
0:05:25.283,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and, you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?

109
0:05:28.822,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I want to show you this clip,

110
0:05:30.238,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act.

111
0:05:34.487,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So actually, check this out.

112
0:05:35.902,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Very embarrassing.

113
0:05:37.077,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Video) (Applause)

114
0:05:38.519,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Thank you. We'll do anything you ask.

115
0:05:42.793,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you,

116
0:05:47.632,000 --> 0:05:48,000
about my mother.

117
0:05:48.818,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.

118
0:05:50.967,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I was dating this guy, right?

119
0:05:52.399,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And this has to do with being happy, I swear.

120
0:05:55.839,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I was dating this guy, and it was going on for about a year,

121
0:06:02.225,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and we were getting serious,

122
0:06:03.592,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.

123
0:06:06.249,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We introduced them to each other.

124
0:06:07.892,000 --> 0:06:09,000
My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,

125
0:06:10.61,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who, it seemed, was a little bit skeptical

126
0:06:13.147,000 --> 0:06:15,000
about the whole "alternative lifestyle" thing --

127
0:06:15.712,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you know, homosexuality.

128
0:06:17.225,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So my mother was a little offended, and turned to her and said,

129
0:06:20.225,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.

130
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They eat out, they see shows ..."

131
0:06:25.831,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They eat out, they see shows.

132
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:28.467,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's the name of the show, "They eat out, they --"

134
0:06:30.92,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's on my tombstone when I die:

135
0:06:32.937,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"He ate out, he saw shows." Right?

136
0:06:35.597,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:37.99,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So in editing these clips,

138
0:06:40.392,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.

139
0:06:44.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So you'll have to go check it out and come see me or something,

140
0:06:47.848,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because it's mortifying.

141
0:06:49.023,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And yet, it feels --

142
0:06:52.643,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I don't know how to put this.

143
0:06:54.18,000 --> 0:07:,000
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing. You know?

144
0:07:00.441,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And at least, you know, in my case,

145
0:07:03.727,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because if I just do one thing all the time,

146
0:07:07.124,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.

147
0:07:13.01,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well.

148
0:07:19.772,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.

149
0:07:22.472,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And I kind of try not to look back, you know?

150
0:07:26.647,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Except, I guess that's what staying up every night is about --

151
0:07:29.654,000 --> 0:07:32,000
like, looking back and thinking, "What a fool you made of yourself."

152
0:07:32.888,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You know?

153
0:07:34.066,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But I guess that's OK. Right?

154
0:07:36.178,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:37.238,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Because if you do many things,

156
0:07:38.716,000 --> 0:07:41,000
you get to feel lousy about everything, and not just one, you know?

157
0:07:42.171,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.

158
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

159
0:07:48.25,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I will show you this next thing,

160
0:07:51.043,000 --> 0:07:52,000
speaking of costumes for operas.

161
0:07:52.615,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I do work with different choreographers.

162
0:07:54.583,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot

163
0:07:56.51,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I work with Mark Morris a lot,

164
0:07:58.346,000 --> 0:07:59,000
who is one of my best friends.

165
0:07:59.815,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And I designed three operas with him --

166
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the most recent one, "King Arthur."

167
0:08:06.058,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I've been very ingrained in the dance world

168
0:08:08.687,000 --> 0:08:09,000
since I was a teenager.

169
0:08:09.862,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I went to a performing arts high school,

170
0:08:11.791,000 --> 0:08:12,000
where I was an actor,

171
0:08:13.029,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and many of my friends were ballet dancers.

172
0:08:15.163,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.

173
0:08:18.788,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I don't know where it comes from.

174
0:08:20.957,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I started making puppets when I was a kid.

175
0:08:23.42,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from: puppets.

176
0:08:26.913,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:28.045,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And then performing arts high school.

178
0:08:29.855,000 --> 0:08:32,000
There I was in high school, meeting dancers and acting.

179
0:08:33.141,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And somehow, from there, I got interested in design.

180
0:08:37.567,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I went to Parsons School of Design,

181
0:08:39.922,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and then I began my career as a designer.

182
0:08:43.282,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I don't really think of myself as a designer,

183
0:08:45.413,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.

184
0:08:48.703,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.

185
0:08:51.224,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I think of myself as ...

186
0:08:53.652,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I don't know what I think of myself as, so ...

187
0:08:56.116,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That's just that.

188
0:08:57.306,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:00.024,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,

190
0:09:03.662,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.

191
0:09:07.38,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You always have to be, like, slightly bored with everything.

192
0:09:10.366,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.

193
0:09:14.013,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:15.37,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But I am really a little bored with everything.

195
0:09:17.765,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything --

196
0:09:21.859,000 --> 0:09:23,000
books everything and makes everything happen

197
0:09:23.967,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and makes all the deals.

198
0:09:25.238,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time

199
0:09:28.934,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on the computer bridge program.

200
0:09:31.008,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like, that's --

201
0:09:35.894,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, somehow, like, about 10 years ago,

202
0:09:38.806,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I thought that the most unboring place in the world

203
0:09:42.469,000 --> 0:09:44,000
would be, like, a TV studio, like for a day show,

204
0:09:45.218,000 --> 0:09:46,000
some kind of day talk show,

205
0:09:46.693,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because it's all of these things that I love

206
0:09:50.309,000 --> 0:09:51,000
kind of in one place.

207
0:09:51.545,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And if you ever get bored, you can look at another thing

208
0:09:54.256,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and do another thing and talk about it, right?

209
0:09:57.028,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And so I had this TV show.

210
0:09:59.115,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.

211
0:10:02.14,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Actually, could you roll the clip, please?

212
0:10:04.165,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie O'Donnell.

213
0:10:06.618,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set. Hi, Ben!

214
0:10:09.19,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.

215
0:10:10.552,000 --> 0:10:12,000
IM: Look how cute she looks with just a slick back.

216
0:10:12.97,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Ben: As my grandmother says, "Delish!"

217
0:10:14.809,000 --> 0:10:15,000
RO: Delish!

218
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
IM: Wow, delish.

219
0:10:17.175,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All right. So where should I position myself?

220
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I want to stay out of the way. I don't want to be -- OK, here we go.

221
0:10:22.844,000 --> 0:10:23,000
RO: Do you get nervous, Ashley?

222
0:10:24.599,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Ashley: Doing what? RO: Cutting hair.

223
0:10:26.454,000 --> 0:10:29,000
A: Never. I don't think there was ever a day when I cut hair I was nervous.

224
0:10:30.153,000 --> 0:10:32,000
IM: You look so cute already. RO: You like it? All right.

225
0:10:32.862,000 --> 0:10:35,000
IM: Do you have a problem looking cute? RO: Of course I want to look cute.

226
0:10:36.409,000 --> 0:10:39,000
IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know, aggressively ugly.

227
0:10:40.262,000 --> 0:10:41,000
RO: No, not me, no.

228
0:10:41.437,000 --> 0:10:44,000
IM: You read about people who have a lot of money and they have kids

229
0:10:44.735,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and the kids always end up somehow, really messed up, you know?

230
0:10:48.457,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.

231
0:10:51.682,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Just because you're fabulously rich and fabulously famous,

232
0:10:55.615,000 --> 0:10:56,000
does that mean you shouldn't have kids,

233
0:10:57.498,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because you know they're going to end up messed up?

234
0:10:59.917,000 --> 0:11:02,000
RO: No, but it means your priority has to be their well-being first, I think.

235
0:11:03.581,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But you have to make the decision for yourself.

236
0:11:05.809,000 --> 0:11:06,000
My kids are seven, who the hell knows?

237
0:11:07.663,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.

238
0:11:09.664,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And they're going to be playing this clip. "I'm such a good mother."

239
0:11:14.035,000 --> 0:11:16,000
My God, this is the shortest I've ever had!

240
0:11:16.068,000 --> 0:11:17,000
IM: It looks good, yeah?

241
0:11:17.243,000 --> 0:11:2,000
A: Has your hair ever been this short? RO: No! But it's all right -- go crazy.

242
0:11:20.965,000 --> 0:11:22,000
IM: I feel like it needs to be closer down here.

243
0:11:23.248,000 --> 0:11:25,000
A: It's just a stage. RO: We're just staging it.

244
0:11:25.523,000 --> 0:11:26,000
IM: Are you freaking out? It's so cute.

245
0:11:27.421,000 --> 0:11:29,000
RO: No, I love it. It's the new me. IM: It's so fabulous!

246
0:11:30.121,000 --> 0:11:31,000
RO: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!

247
0:11:32.165,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

248
0:11:33.606,000 --> 0:11:37,000
IM: By the way, of all the most unboring things in the world, right?

249
0:11:38.046,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I mean, like, making someone who's already cute look terrible like that --

250
0:11:41.634,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

251
0:11:42.688,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.

252
0:11:45.479,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

253
0:11:46.51,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,

254
0:11:50.914,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"Style makes you feel great,

255
0:11:52.673,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."

256
0:11:55.89,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Right?

257
0:11:57.065,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

258
0:11:58.14,000 --> 0:12:,000
And then I realized that was on my website,

259
0:12:00.879,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and it said, you know, the quote was attributed to me.

260
0:12:03.466,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I thought, "Oh, I said something in an interview. I forgot I said that."

261
0:12:07.186,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But it's really true.

262
0:12:08.55,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.

263
0:12:13.254,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I'll tell you that I cook a lot also.

264
0:12:15.078,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I love to cook.

265
0:12:16.54,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And I often look at things as though they're food.

266
0:12:19.641,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Like, I say, "Would you serve a rotten chicken?

267
0:12:21.908,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Then how could you serve a beat-up old dress or something?

268
0:12:24.653,000 --> 0:12:25,000
How could you show a beat-up old dress?"

269
0:12:26.642,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I always relate things to kitchen-ry.

270
0:12:29.393,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:30.48,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And so I think that's what it all boils down to.

272
0:12:33.462,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Everything boils down to that.

273
0:12:35.044,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So check this out.

274
0:12:36.225,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is what I've been doing,

275
0:12:37.634,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.

276
0:12:40.139,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's, like, this website with a lot of different things on it.

277
0:12:43.075,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It's a polymathematical website.

278
0:12:44.639,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We actually shoot segments, like TV show segments.

279
0:12:47.79,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.

280
0:12:50.698,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And it just began, like, in the beginning of February. So who knows?

281
0:12:53.941,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?

282
0:12:57.472,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And here's the last bit.

283
0:12:58.997,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Music)

284
0:13:01.924,000 --> 0:13:05,000
IM: I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.

285
0:13:06.195,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Sara Moulton: Do you?

286
0:13:07.37,000 --> 0:13:09,000
IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.

287
0:13:10.038,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You can't find it at Citarella, you can't find it.

288
0:13:12.509,000 --> 0:13:13,000
SM: You can't? IM: It's always low-fat.

289
0:13:14.45,000 --> 0:13:15,000
SM: But that's all it is. IM: It is? OK.

290
0:13:16.454,000 --> 0:13:18,000
SM: You don't know? Let me tell you something interesting.

291
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
IM: You know what? Stop laughing! It's not funny.

292
0:13:21.661,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Just because I don't know there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.

293
0:13:24.884,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Sorry. What?

294
0:13:26.059,000 --> 0:13:29,000
SM: Here's the deal: in the old days, when they used to make butter --

295
0:13:29.421,000 --> 0:13:3,000
You know how you make butter?

296
0:13:30.831,000 --> 0:13:31,000
IM: Churn. SM: From cream.

297
0:13:32.148,000 --> 0:13:33,000
IM: Yeah, exactly.

298
0:13:33.323,000 --> 0:13:36,000
SM: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,

299
0:13:36.396,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.

300
0:13:40.96,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The liquid is actually -- if you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,

301
0:13:44.869,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it's actually buttermilk.

302
0:13:46.535,000 --> 0:13:47,000
That's what it was in the early days.

303
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000

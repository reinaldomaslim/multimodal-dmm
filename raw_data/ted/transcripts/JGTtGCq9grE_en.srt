Transcriber: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:12.993,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to lead here by talking a little bit about my credentials

3
0:00:16.62,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to bring this up with you,

4
0:00:18.254,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because, quite honestly,

5
0:00:20.495,000 --> 0:00:24,000
you really, really should not listen to any old person with an opinion

6
0:00:24.987,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about COVID-19.

7
0:00:26.602,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:28.255,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So I've been working in global health for about 20 years,

9
0:00:32.284,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and my specific technical specialty is in health systems

10
0:00:36.822,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and what happens when health systems experience severe shocks.

11
0:00:40.724,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I've also worked in global health journalism;

12
0:00:43.217,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I've written about global health and biosecurity

13
0:00:46.952,000 --> 0:00:49,000
for newspapers and web outlets,

14
0:00:50.088,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I published a book a few years back

15
0:00:52.267,000 --> 0:00:55,000
about the major global health threats facing us as a planet.

16
0:00:56.281,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I have supported and led epidemiology efforts

17
0:01:00.071,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that range from evaluating Ebola treatment centers

18
0:01:03.963,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to looking at transmission of tuberculosis in health facilities

19
0:01:08.116,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and doing avian influenza preparedness.

20
0:01:11.397,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I have a master's degree in International Health.

21
0:01:14.94,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'm not a physician. I'm not a nurse.

22
0:01:17.072,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My specialty isn't patient care or taking care of individual people.

23
0:01:21.369,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My specialty is looking at populations and health systems,

24
0:01:25.074,000 --> 0:01:28,000
what happens when diseases move on the large level.

25
0:01:29.288,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If we're ranking sources of global health expertise

26
0:01:32.97,000 --> 0:01:34,000
on a scale of one to 10,

27
0:01:35.573,000 --> 0:01:38,000
one is some random person ranting on Facebook

28
0:01:39.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and 10 is the World Health Organization,

29
0:01:43.099,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I'd say you can probably put me at like a seven or an eight.

30
0:01:46.847,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So keep that in mind as I talk to you.

31
0:01:50.931,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'll start with the basics here, because I think that's gotten lost

32
0:01:54.14,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in some of the media noise around COVID-19.

33
0:01:58.281,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, COVID-19 is a coronavirus.

34
0:02:02.275,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Coronaviruses are a specific subset of virus,

35
0:02:06.252,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and they have some unique characteristics as viruses.

36
0:02:09.687,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material,

37
0:02:13.45,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they're covered in spikes on the surface of the virus.

38
0:02:16.597,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They use those spikes to invade cells.

39
0:02:19.508,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Those spikes are the corona in coronavirus.

40
0:02:24.364,000 --> 0:02:27,000
COVID-19 is known as a novel coronavirus

41
0:02:28.059,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because, until December, we'd only heard of six coronaviruses.

42
0:02:32.197,000 --> 0:02:33,000
COVID-19 is the seventh.

43
0:02:34.137,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's new to us.

44
0:02:35.321,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It just had its gene sequencing,

45
0:02:36.936,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it just got its name.

46
0:02:38.155,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's why it's novel.

47
0:02:40.215,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If you remember SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,

48
0:02:44.452,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or MERS,

49
0:02:45.647,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome,

50
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:49,000
those were coronaviruses.

51
0:02:49.662,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And they're both called respiratory syndromes,

52
0:02:52.803,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because that's what coronaviruses do --

53
0:02:55.716,000 --> 0:02:56,000
they go for your lungs.

54
0:02:57.538,000 --> 0:03:,000
They don't make you puke, they don't make you bleed from the eyeballs,

55
0:03:00.906,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they don't make you hemorrhage.

56
0:03:02.414,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They head for your lungs.

57
0:03:04.595,000 --> 0:03:06,000
COVID-19 is no different.

58
0:03:07.193,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It causes a range of respiratory symptoms

59
0:03:10.541,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that go from stuff like a dry cough and a fever

60
0:03:13.738,000 --> 0:03:16,000
all the way out to fatal viral pneumonia.

61
0:03:17.41,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And that range of symptoms is one of the reasons

62
0:03:20.723,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's actually been so hard to track this outbreak.

63
0:03:24.094,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Plenty of people get COVID-19 but so gently,

64
0:03:29.214,000 --> 0:03:32,000
their symptoms are so mild, they don't even go to a health care provider.

65
0:03:33.197,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They don't register in the system.

66
0:03:35.119,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Children, in particular, have it very easy with COVID-19,

67
0:03:38.903,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is something we should all be grateful for.

68
0:03:43.57,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Coronaviruses are zoonotic,

69
0:03:45.958,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which means that they transmit from animals to people.

70
0:03:49.242,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Some coronaviruses, like COVID-19, also transmit person to person.

71
0:03:54.589,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The person-to-person ones travel faster and travel farther,

72
0:03:57.98,000 --> 0:03:58,000
just like COVID-19.

73
0:04:00.079,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Zoonotic illnesses are really hard to get rid of,

74
0:04:03.439,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because they have an animal reservoir.

75
0:04:06.229,000 --> 0:04:09,000
One example is avian influenza,

76
0:04:09.275,000 --> 0:04:14,000
where we can abolish it in farmed animals, in turkeys, in ducks,

77
0:04:14.4,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but it keeps coming back every year because it's brought to us by wild birds.

78
0:04:18.647,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You don't hear a lot about it

79
0:04:20.086,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because avian influenza doesn't transmit person-to-person,

80
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but we have outbreaks in poultry farms every year all over the world.

81
0:04:28.506,000 --> 0:04:32,000
COVID-19 most likely skipped from animals into people

82
0:04:32.759,000 --> 0:04:34,000
at a wild animal market in Wuhan, China.

83
0:04:36.987,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now for the less basic parts.

84
0:04:40.034,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is not the last major outbreak we're ever going to see.

85
0:04:44.106,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There's going to be more outbreaks, and there's going to be more epidemics.

86
0:04:48.395,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That's not a maybe. That's a given.

87
0:04:51.672,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And it's a result of the way that we, as human beings,

88
0:04:54.885,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are interacting with our planet.

89
0:04:57.225,000 --> 0:05:,000
Human choices are driving us into a position

90
0:05:00.297,000 --> 0:05:02,000
where we're going to see more outbreaks.

91
0:05:03.539,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Part of that is about climate change

92
0:05:05.325,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the way a warming climate makes the world more hospitable

93
0:05:08.299,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to viruses and bacteria.

94
0:05:10.287,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But it's also about the way we're pushing into the last wild spaces on our planet.

95
0:05:16.916,000 --> 0:05:18,000
When we burn and plow the Amazon rain forest

96
0:05:19.903,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so that we can have cheap land for ranching,

97
0:05:22.478,000 --> 0:05:25,000
when the last of the African bush gets converted to farms,

98
0:05:26.499,000 --> 0:05:3,000
when wild animals in China are hunted to extinction,

99
0:05:31.325,000 --> 0:05:34,000
human beings come into contact with wildlife populations

100
0:05:34.485,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that they've never come into contact with before,

101
0:05:37.302,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and those populations have new kinds of diseases:

102
0:05:40.314,000 --> 0:05:43,000
bacteria, viruses, stuff we're not ready for.

103
0:05:44.612,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Bats, in particular,

104
0:05:46.109,000 --> 0:05:49,000
have a knack for hosting illnesses that can infect people,

105
0:05:49.402,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but they're not the only animals that do it.

106
0:05:52.61,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So as long as we keep making our remote places less remote,

107
0:05:57.274,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the outbreaks are going to keep coming.

108
0:06:01.093,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We can't stop the outbreaks with quarantine or travel restrictions.

109
0:06:05.761,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's everybody's first impulse:

110
0:06:07.697,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"Let's stop the people from moving. Let's stop this outbreak from happening."

111
0:06:11.591,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But the fact is, it's really hard to get a good quarantine in place.

112
0:06:17.1,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's really hard to set up travel restrictions.

113
0:06:20.2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Even the countries that have made serious investments in public health,

114
0:06:23.872,000 --> 0:06:24,000
like the US and South Korea,

115
0:06:25.592,000 --> 0:06:27,000
can't get that kind of restriction in place fast enough

116
0:06:28.305,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to actually stop an outbreak instantly.

117
0:06:31.123,000 --> 0:06:34,000
There's logistical reasons for that, and there's medical reasons.

118
0:06:34.667,000 --> 0:06:36,000
If you look at COVID-19 right now,

119
0:06:37.526,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it seems like it could have a period where you're infected and show no symptoms

120
0:06:41.574,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that's as long as 24 days.

121
0:06:44.46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So people are walking around with this virus showing no signs.

122
0:06:48.4,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They're not going to get quarantined. Nobody knows they need quarantining.

123
0:06:55.09,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's also some real costs to quarantine and to travel restrictions.

124
0:06:59.94,000 --> 0:07:,000
Humans are social animals,

125
0:07:01.703,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and they resist when you try to hold them into place

126
0:07:04.531,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and when you try to separate them.

127
0:07:06.727,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon as you put a quarantine in place,

128
0:07:12.719,000 --> 0:07:14,000
people start trying to evade it.

129
0:07:15.15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Individual patients, if they know there's a strict quarantine protocol,

130
0:07:19.226,000 --> 0:07:21,000
may not go for health care,

131
0:07:21.378,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because they're afraid of the medical system or they can't afford care

132
0:07:24.847,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and they don't want to be separated from their family and friends.

133
0:07:28.158,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Politicians, government officials,

134
0:07:30.098,000 --> 0:07:32,000
when they know that they're going to get quarantined

135
0:07:32.585,000 --> 0:07:33,000
if they talk about outbreaks and cases,

136
0:07:34.472,000 --> 0:07:38,000
may conceal real information for fear of triggering a quarantine protocol.

137
0:07:39.522,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And, of course, these kinds of evasions and dishonesty

138
0:07:43.295,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are exactly what makes it so difficult to track a disease outbreak.

139
0:07:49.101,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We can get better at quarantines and travel restrictions, and we should,

140
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but they're not our only option, and they're not our best option

141
0:07:56.38,000 --> 0:07:57,000
for dealing with these situations.

142
0:07:59.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The real way for the long haul to make outbreaks less serious

143
0:08:03.816,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is to build the global health system

144
0:08:06.613,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to support core health care functions in every country in the world

145
0:08:11.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so that all countries, even poor ones,

146
0:08:14.308,000 --> 0:08:18,000
are able to rapidly identify and treat new infectious diseases as they emerge.

147
0:08:20.375,000 --> 0:08:24,000
China's taken a lot of criticism for its response to COVID-19.

148
0:08:25.088,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But the fact is, what if COVID-19 had emerged in Chad,

149
0:08:29.505,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which has three and a half doctors for every hundred thousand people?

150
0:08:33.999,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What if it had emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

151
0:08:37.024,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which just released its last Ebola patient from treatment?

152
0:08:41.193,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The truth is, countries like this don't have the resources

153
0:08:44.194,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to respond to an infectious disease --

154
0:08:46.38,000 --> 0:08:48,000
not to treat people and not to report on it fast enough

155
0:08:49.109,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to help the rest of the world.

156
0:08:52.878,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I led an evaluation of Ebola treatment centers in Sierra Leone,

157
0:08:57.819,000 --> 0:09:,000
and the fact is that local doctors in Sierra Leone

158
0:09:00.946,000 --> 0:09:02,000
identified the Ebola crisis very quickly,

159
0:09:03.941,000 --> 0:09:05,000
first as a dangerous, contagious hemorrhagic virus

160
0:09:06.921,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then as Ebola itself.

161
0:09:09.423,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But, having identified it, they didn't have the resources to respond.

162
0:09:13.579,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They didn't have enough doctors, they didn't have enough hospital beds

163
0:09:16.973,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and they didn't have enough information about how to treat Ebola

164
0:09:20.048,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or how to implement infection control.

165
0:09:23.075,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Eleven doctors died in Sierra Leone of Ebola.

166
0:09:27.826,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The country only had 120 when the crisis started.

167
0:09:31.885,000 --> 0:09:32,000
By way of contrast,

168
0:09:33.377,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Dallas Baylor Medical Center has more than a thousand physicians on staff.

169
0:09:38.615,000 --> 0:09:4,000
These are the kinds of inequities that kill people.

170
0:09:41.451,000 --> 0:09:43,000
First, they kill the poor people when the outbreaks start,

171
0:09:44.22,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and then they kill people all over the world

172
0:09:46.692,000 --> 0:09:47,000
when the outbreaks spread.

173
0:09:48.963,000 --> 0:09:5,000
If we really want to slow down these outbreaks

174
0:09:51.262,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and minimize their impact,

175
0:09:52.894,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we need to make sure that every country in the world

176
0:09:56.009,000 --> 0:09:58,000
has the capacity to identify new diseases,

177
0:09:58.897,000 --> 0:09:59,000
treat them

178
0:10:00.179,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and report about them so they can share information.

179
0:10:04.445,000 --> 0:10:07,000
COVID-19 is going to be a huge burden on health systems.

180
0:10:08.517,000 --> 0:10:11,000
COVID-19 has also revealed some real weaknesses

181
0:10:12.014,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in our global health supply chains.

182
0:10:14.399,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Just-in-time-ordering, lean systems are great when things are going well,

183
0:10:19.157,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but in a time of crisis, what it means is we don't have any reserves.

184
0:10:23.217,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If a hospital -- or a country --

185
0:10:25.603,000 --> 0:10:28,000
runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment,

186
0:10:29.518,000 --> 0:10:32,000
there's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more.

187
0:10:33.282,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You have to order more from the supplier,

188
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you have to wait for them to produce it and you have to wait for them to ship it,

189
0:10:39.195,000 --> 0:10:4,000
generally from China.

190
0:10:40.381,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That's a time lag at a time when it's most important to move quickly.

191
0:10:45.391,000 --> 0:10:49,000
If we'd been perfectly prepared for COVID-19,

192
0:10:49.434,000 --> 0:10:52,000
China would have identified the outbreak faster.

193
0:10:52.985,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They would have been ready to provide care to infected people

194
0:10:56.563,000 --> 0:10:58,000
without having to build new buildings.

195
0:10:59.127,000 --> 0:11:02,000
They would have shared honest information with citizens

196
0:11:02.388,000 --> 0:11:04,000
so that we didn't see these crazy rumors spreading

197
0:11:04.821,000 --> 0:11:05,000
on social media in China.

198
0:11:06.822,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And they would have shared information with global health authorities

199
0:11:10.196,000 --> 0:11:12,000
so that they could start reporting to national health systems

200
0:11:13.121,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and getting ready for when the virus spread.

201
0:11:15.959,000 --> 0:11:18,000
National health systems would then have been able to stockpile

202
0:11:19.079,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the protective equipment they needed

203
0:11:20.88,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and train health care providers on treatment and infection control.

204
0:11:25.192,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We'd have science-based protocols for what to do when things happen,

205
0:11:29.35,000 --> 0:11:31,000
like cruise ships have infected patients.

206
0:11:31.983,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And we'd have real information going out to people everywhere,

207
0:11:36.31,000 --> 0:11:4,000
so we wouldn't see embarrassing, shameful incidents of xenophobia,

208
0:11:40.375,000 --> 0:11:44,000
like Asian-looking people getting attacked on the street in Philadelphia.

209
0:11:45.403,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But even with all of that in place,

210
0:11:47.211,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we would still have outbreaks.

211
0:11:50.939,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The choices we're making about how we occupy this planet

212
0:11:53.691,000 --> 0:11:54,000
make that inevitable.

213
0:11:56.003,000 --> 0:12:,000
As far as we have an expert consensus on COVID-19, it's this:

214
0:12:01.006,000 --> 0:12:03,000
here in the US, and globally,

215
0:12:03.316,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it's going to get worse before it gets better.

216
0:12:06.489,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We're seeing cases of human transmission that aren't from returning travel,

217
0:12:10.955,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that are just happening in the community,

218
0:12:13.077,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and we're seeing people infected with COVID-19

219
0:12:15.32,000 --> 0:12:18,000
when we don't even know where the infection came from.

220
0:12:18.532,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Those are signs of an outbreak that's getting worse,

221
0:12:21.279,000 --> 0:12:23,000
not an outbreak that's under control.

222
0:12:26.298,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's depressing, but it's not surprising.

223
0:12:30.15,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Global health experts,

224
0:12:31.386,000 --> 0:12:33,000
when they talk about the scenario of new viruses,

225
0:12:34.355,000 --> 0:12:36,000
this is one of the scenarios that they look at.

226
0:12:36.977,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We all hoped we'd get off easy,

227
0:12:39.573,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but when experts talk about viral planning,

228
0:12:42.982,000 --> 0:12:45,000
this is the kind of situation and the way they expect the virus to move.

229
0:12:48.727,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I want to close here with some personal advice.

230
0:12:52.524,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Wash your hands.

231
0:12:54.442,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Wash your hands a lot.

232
0:12:56.862,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I know you already wash your hands a lot because you're not disgusting,

233
0:13:00.239,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but wash your hands even more.

234
0:13:02.469,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Set up cues and routines in your life to get you to wash your hands.

235
0:13:06.446,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Wash your hands every time you enter and leave a building.

236
0:13:09.438,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Wash your hands when you go into a meeting and when you come out of a meeting.

237
0:13:13.166,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Get rituals that are based around handwashing.

238
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Sanitize your phone.

239
0:13:18.038,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You touch that phone with your dirty, unwashed hands all the time.

240
0:13:21.843,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I know you take it into the bathroom with you.

241
0:13:24.295,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter)

242
0:13:27.264,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So sanitize your phone and consider not using it as often in public.

243
0:13:32.338,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Maybe TikTok and Instagram can be home things only.

244
0:13:36.55,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Don't touch your face.

245
0:13:38.888,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Don't rub your eyes.

246
0:13:40.562,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Don't bite your fingernails.

247
0:13:42.038,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Don't wipe your nose on the back of your hand.

248
0:13:44.234,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I mean, don't do that anyway because, gross.

249
0:13:46.335,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Laughter)

250
0:13:48.114,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Don't wear a face mask.

251
0:13:50.158,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Face masks are for sick people and health care providers.

252
0:13:53.497,000 --> 0:13:56,000
If you're sick, your face mask holds in all your coughing and sneezing

253
0:13:57.433,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and protects the people around you.

254
0:13:59.614,000 --> 0:14:,000
And if you're a health care provider,

255
0:14:01.457,000 --> 0:14:03,000
your face mask is one tool in a set of tools

256
0:14:04.092,000 --> 0:14:05,000
called personal protective equipment

257
0:14:05.949,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that you're trained to use so that you can give patient care

258
0:14:08.834,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and not get sick yourself.

259
0:14:10.462,000 --> 0:14:13,000
If you're a regular healthy person wearing a face mask,

260
0:14:13.496,000 --> 0:14:15,000
it's just making your face sweaty.

261
0:14:15.751,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

262
0:14:16.917,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Leave the face masks in stores

263
0:14:19.338,000 --> 0:14:21,000
for the doctors and the nurses and the sick people.

264
0:14:23.195,000 --> 0:14:25,000
If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19,

265
0:14:25.71,000 --> 0:14:27,000
stay home, call your doctor for advice.

266
0:14:29.143,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If you're diagnosed with COVID-19, remember it's generally very mild.

267
0:14:34.595,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And if you're a smoker,

268
0:14:36.08,000 --> 0:14:38,000
right now is the best possible time to quit smoking.

269
0:14:39.679,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I mean, if you're a smoker,

270
0:14:41.052,000 --> 0:14:44,000
right now is always the best possible time to quit smoking,

271
0:14:44.493,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but if you're a smoker and you're worried about COVID-19,

272
0:14:47.383,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I guarantee that quitting is absolutely the best thing you can do

273
0:14:51.157,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to protect yourself from the worst impacts of COVID-19.

274
0:14:56.846,000 --> 0:14:58,000
COVID-19 is scary stuff,

275
0:14:59.369,000 --> 0:15:03,000
at a time when pretty much all of our news feels like scary stuff.

276
0:15:04.099,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And there's a lot of bad but appealing options for dealing with it:

277
0:15:09.117,000 --> 0:15:14,000
panic, xenophobia, agoraphobia, authoritarianism,

278
0:15:14.429,000 --> 0:15:18,000
oversimplified lies that make us think that hate and fury and loneliness

279
0:15:19.267,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are the solution to outbreaks.

280
0:15:21.444,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But they're not.

281
0:15:22.682,000 --> 0:15:24,000
They just make us less prepared.

282
0:15:25.356,000 --> 0:15:29,000
There's also a boring but useful set of options

283
0:15:29.59,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that we can use in response to outbreaks,

284
0:15:32.326,000 --> 0:15:35,000
things like improving health care here and everywhere;

285
0:15:35.748,000 --> 0:15:38,000
investing in health infrastructure and disease surveillance

286
0:15:38.967,000 --> 0:15:4,000
so that we know when the new diseases come;

287
0:15:41.326,000 --> 0:15:43,000
building health systems all over the world;

288
0:15:44.292,000 --> 0:15:48,000
looking at strengthening our supply chains so they're ready for emergencies;

289
0:15:48.887,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and better education,

290
0:15:51.039,000 --> 0:15:55,000
so we're capable of talking about disease outbreaks and the mathematics of risk

291
0:15:55.548,000 --> 0:15:57,000
without just blind panic.

292
0:15:58.79,000 --> 0:16:,000
We need to be guided by equity here,

293
0:16:00.941,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because in this situation, like so many,

294
0:16:03.281,000 --> 0:16:06,000
equity is actually in our own self-interest.

295
0:16:07.727,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So thank you so much for listening to me today,

296
0:16:10.453,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and can I be the first one to tell you:

297
0:16:12.374,000 --> 0:16:14,000
wash your hands when you leave the theater.

298
0:16:14.564,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Applause)

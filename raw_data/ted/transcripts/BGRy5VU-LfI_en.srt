1
0:00:12.36,000 --> 0:00:13,000
It's a pleasure to be here

2
0:00:13.779,000 --> 0:00:14,000
in Edinburgh, Scotland,

3
0:00:15.728,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the birthplace of the needle and syringe.

4
0:00:18.891,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Less than a mile from here in this direction,

5
0:00:21.732,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in 1853 a Scotsman

6
0:00:23.706,000 --> 0:00:25,000
filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.

7
0:00:26.134,000 --> 0:00:28,000
His name was Alexander Wood,

8
0:00:28.236,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.

9
0:00:31.987,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is the patent.

10
0:00:34.465,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What blows my mind when I look at it even today

11
0:00:37.176,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is that it looks almost identical

12
0:00:39.349,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to the needle in use today.

13
0:00:41.106,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Yet, it's 160 years old.

14
0:00:44.666,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So we turn to the field of vaccines.

15
0:00:47.161,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Most vaccines are delivered with

16
0:00:49.39,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the needle and syringe, this 160-year-old technology.

17
0:00:53.534,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And credit where it's due -- on many levels,

18
0:00:55.445,000 --> 0:00:58,000
vaccines are a successful technology.

19
0:00:59.096,000 --> 0:01:02,000
After clean water and sanitation,

20
0:01:02.985,000 --> 0:01:06,000
vaccines are the one technology that has increased

21
0:01:07.259,000 --> 0:01:09,000
our life span the most.

22
0:01:09.789,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's a pretty hard act to beat.

23
0:01:12.264,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But just like any other technology,

24
0:01:14.057,000 --> 0:01:15,000
vaccines have their shortcomings,

25
0:01:15.902,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and the needle and syringe

26
0:01:18.538,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is a key part within that narrative --

27
0:01:20.741,000 --> 0:01:22,000
this old technology.

28
0:01:23.67,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So let's start with the obvious:

29
0:01:25.969,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Many of us don't like the needle and syringe.

30
0:01:29.451,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I share that view.

31
0:01:31.365,000 --> 0:01:34,000
However, 20 percent of the population

32
0:01:34.557,000 --> 0:01:36,000
have a thing called needle phobia.

33
0:01:36.833,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That's more than disliking the needle;

34
0:01:38.594,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that is actively avoiding being vaccinated

35
0:01:41.063,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because of needle phobia.

36
0:01:42.927,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And that's problematic in terms of the rollout of vaccines.

37
0:01:46.934,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, related to this is another key issue,

38
0:01:49.079,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which is needlestick injuries.

39
0:01:51.412,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the WHO has figures

40
0:01:53.384,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year

41
0:01:57.219,000 --> 0:01:59,000
take place due to cross-contamination

42
0:01:59.611,000 --> 0:02:,000
with needlestick injuries.

43
0:02:00.895,000 --> 0:02:02,000
These are early deaths that take place.

44
0:02:03.577,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, these are two things that you probably may have heard of,

45
0:02:06.558,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but there are two other shortcomings

46
0:02:08.438,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about.

47
0:02:10.922,000 --> 0:02:11,000
One is it could be holding back

48
0:02:12.903,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the next generation of vaccines

49
0:02:14.382,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in terms of their immune responses.

50
0:02:16.671,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And the second is that it could be responsible

51
0:02:19.598,000 --> 0:02:23,000
for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well.

52
0:02:24.21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm going to tell you about some work

53
0:02:25.792,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that my team and I are doing in Australia

54
0:02:27.86,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at the University of Queensland

55
0:02:29.601,000 --> 0:02:33,000
on a technology designed to tackle those four problems.

56
0:02:33.998,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And that technology is called the Nanopatch.

57
0:02:38.343,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.

58
0:02:44.817,000 --> 0:02:45,000
To the naked eye

59
0:02:46.466,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it just looks like a square

60
0:02:48.65,000 --> 0:02:5,000
smaller than a postage stamp,

61
0:02:51.549,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but under a microscope

62
0:02:54.215,000 --> 0:02:56,000
what you see are thousands of tiny projections

63
0:02:56.533,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that are invisible to the human eye.

64
0:02:58.754,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And there's about 4,000 projections

65
0:03:00.511,000 --> 0:03:03,000
on this particular square compared to the needle.

66
0:03:03.907,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And I've designed those projections

67
0:03:06.551,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to serve a key role, which is to work with the skin's immune system.

68
0:03:10.601,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So that's a very important function

69
0:03:12.996,000 --> 0:03:13,000
tied in with the Nanopatch.

70
0:03:14.452,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now we make the Nanopatch

71
0:03:16.699,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with a technique

72
0:03:19.236,000 --> 0:03:21,000
called deep reactive ion etching.

73
0:03:21.615,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this particular technique is one that's been borrowed

74
0:03:23.659,000 --> 0:03:24,000
from the semiconductor industry,

75
0:03:25.286,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and therefore is low cost

76
0:03:27.122,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and can be rolled out in large numbers.

77
0:03:29.316,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now we dry-coat vaccines to the projections of the Nanopatch

78
0:03:34.382,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and apply it to the skin.

79
0:03:36.201,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, the simplest form of application

80
0:03:40.757,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is using our finger,

81
0:03:42.779,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but our finger has some limitations,

82
0:03:45.399,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so we've devised an applicator.

83
0:03:47.483,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And it's a very simple device --

84
0:03:48.97,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you could call it a sophisticated finger.

85
0:03:51.088,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's a spring-operated device.

86
0:03:54.128,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What we do is when we apply the Nanopatch to the skin as so --

87
0:03:57.95,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Click) --

88
0:03:59.819,000 --> 0:04:01,000
immediately a few things happen.

89
0:04:02.736,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch

90
0:04:06.783,000 --> 0:04:07,000
breach through the tough outer layer

91
0:04:08.46,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the vaccine is very quickly released --

92
0:04:10.506,000 --> 0:04:12,000
within less than a minute, in fact.

93
0:04:12.854,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Then we can take the Nanopatch off

94
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and discard it.

95
0:04:17.358,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself.

96
0:04:23.244,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,

97
0:04:25.98,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and immediately you can see some key advantages.

98
0:04:28.556,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We've talked about it being needle-free --

99
0:04:30.496,000 --> 0:04:32,000
these are projections that you can't even see --

100
0:04:32.73,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and, of course, we get around

101
0:04:34.441,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the needle phobia issue as well.

102
0:04:37.514,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now, if we take a step back and think about

103
0:04:39.445,000 --> 0:04:42,000
these other two really important advantages:

104
0:04:42.841,000 --> 0:04:46,000
One is improved immune responses through delivery,

105
0:04:46.877,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the second is getting rid of the cold chain.

106
0:04:50.471,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So let's start with the first one, this immunogenicity idea.

107
0:04:52.843,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It takes a little while to get our heads around,

108
0:04:54.849,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but I'll try to explain it in simple terms.

109
0:04:58.578,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So I'll take a step back and explain to you

110
0:05:00.428,000 --> 0:05:03,000
how vaccines work in a simple way.

111
0:05:03.838,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So vaccines work by introducing into our body

112
0:05:06.415,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a thing called an antigen

113
0:05:08.518,000 --> 0:05:11,000
which is a safe form of a germ.

114
0:05:11.695,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now that safe germ, that antigen,

115
0:05:13.715,000 --> 0:05:16,000
tricks our body into mounting an immune response,

116
0:05:17.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
learning and remembering how to deal with intruders.

117
0:05:21.288,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When the real intruder comes along

118
0:05:23.656,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the body quickly mounts an immune response

119
0:05:25.417,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to deal with that vaccine

120
0:05:27.053,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and neutralizes the infection.

121
0:05:28.953,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So it does that well.

122
0:05:30.643,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, the way it's done today with the needle and syringe,

123
0:05:32.98,000 --> 0:05:34,000
most vaccines are delivered that way --

124
0:05:35.431,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with this old technology and the needle.

125
0:05:37.115,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But it could be argued that the needle is holding back our immune responses;

126
0:05:42.264,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.

127
0:05:45.706,000 --> 0:05:47,000
To describe this idea,

128
0:05:48.702,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we need to take a journey through the skin,

129
0:05:51.191,000 --> 0:05:53,000
starting with one of those projections

130
0:05:53.815,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and applying the Nanopatch to the skin.

131
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we see this kind of data.

132
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, this is real data --

133
0:06:00.469,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that thing that we can see there is one projection

134
0:06:02.815,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin

135
0:06:05.271,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and those colors are different layers.

136
0:06:07.196,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, to give you an idea of scale,

137
0:06:08.48,000 --> 0:06:09,000
if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.

138
0:06:10.42,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It would be 10 times bigger

139
0:06:11.945,000 --> 0:06:13,000
than the size of that screen, going 10 times deeper as well.

140
0:06:14.867,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's off the grid entirely.

141
0:06:17.082,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You can see immediately that we have those projections in the skin.

142
0:06:20.275,000 --> 0:06:23,000
That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,

143
0:06:23.327,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but the brown layer and the magenta layer

144
0:06:25.841,000 --> 0:06:28,000
are jammed full of immune cells.

145
0:06:29.022,000 --> 0:06:3,000
As one example, in the brown layer

146
0:06:30.878,000 --> 0:06:32,000
there's a certain type of cell called a Langerhans cell --

147
0:06:33.232,000 --> 0:06:35,000
every square millimeter of our body

148
0:06:35.445,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,

149
0:06:38.465,000 --> 0:06:4,000
those immune cells, and there's others shown as well

150
0:06:40.568,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that we haven't stained in this image.

151
0:06:42.363,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch

152
0:06:44.543,000 --> 0:06:45,000
achieves that penetration indeed.

153
0:06:46.28,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We target thousands upon thousands of these particular cells

154
0:06:49.709,000 --> 0:06:51,000
just residing within a hair's width

155
0:06:52.047,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of the surface of the skin.

156
0:06:55.328,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now, as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that,

157
0:06:59.09,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I found that exciting. But so what?

158
0:07:02.526,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So what if you've targeted cells?

159
0:07:04.478,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?

160
0:07:07.281,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The world of vaccines is getting better.

161
0:07:09.702,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's getting more systematic.

162
0:07:11.426,000 --> 0:07:13,000
However, you still don't really know

163
0:07:13.648,000 --> 0:07:14,000
if a vaccine is going to work

164
0:07:15.392,000 --> 0:07:16,000
until you roll your sleeves up

165
0:07:16.731,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and vaccinate and wait.

166
0:07:18.946,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's a gambler's game even today.

167
0:07:21.648,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, we had to do that gamble.

168
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We obtained an influenza vaccine,

169
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we applied it to our Nanopatches

170
0:07:28.256,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,

171
0:07:30.727,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and we waited --

172
0:07:32.46,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this is in the live animal.

173
0:07:34.288,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We waited a month,

174
0:07:36.139,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and this is what we found out.

175
0:07:37.951,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is a data slide showing the immune responses

176
0:07:40.276,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that we've generated with a Nanopatch

177
0:07:42.599,000 --> 0:07:45,000
compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.

178
0:07:46.375,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms.

179
0:07:49.969,000 --> 0:07:51,000
On the vertical axis we have the immune response generated,

180
0:07:52.674,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and that dashed line indicates the protection threshold.

181
0:07:58.189,000 --> 0:08:,000
If we're above that line it's considered protective;

182
0:08:00.642,000 --> 0:08:02,000
if we're below that line it's not.

183
0:08:03.568,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So the red line is mostly below that curve

184
0:08:06.136,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and indeed there's only one point that is achieved with the needle that's protective,

185
0:08:09.66,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.

186
0:08:12.869,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But notice immediately the distinctly different curve

187
0:08:15.402,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that we achieve with the blue line.

188
0:08:18.466,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;

189
0:08:20.366,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is

190
0:08:22.103,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a completely different immunogenicity curve.

191
0:08:25.464,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That's a real fresh opportunity.

192
0:08:27.297,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Suddenly we have a brand new lever

193
0:08:29.675,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in the world of vaccines.

194
0:08:31.203,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We can push it one way,

195
0:08:32.714,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive

196
0:08:35.305,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and can get protection

197
0:08:36.964,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle.

198
0:08:39.788,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That can take a vaccine that's suddenly 10 dollars down to 10 cents,

199
0:08:43.839,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that's particularly important within the developing world.

200
0:08:47.019,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But there's another angle to this as well --

201
0:08:48.886,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you can take vaccines that currently don't work

202
0:08:51.938,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and get them over that line

203
0:08:53.134,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and get them protective.

204
0:08:55.092,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And certainly in the world of vaccines

205
0:08:57.32,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that can be important.

206
0:08:58.54,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Let's consider the big three:

207
0:09:00.038,000 --> 0:09:02,000
HIV, malaria, tuberculosis.

208
0:09:02.735,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They're responsible for about 7 million deaths per year,

209
0:09:05.327,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those.

210
0:09:08.534,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So potentially, with this new lever that we have with the Nanopatch,

211
0:09:11.066,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we can help make that happen.

212
0:09:12.901,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines over the line.

213
0:09:17.771,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now, of course, we've worked within my lab

214
0:09:19.589,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with many other vaccines that have attained

215
0:09:21.379,000 --> 0:09:23,000
similar responses and similar curves to this,

216
0:09:24.197,000 --> 0:09:27,000
what we've achieved with influenza.

217
0:09:27.962,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I'd like to now switch to talk about

218
0:09:30.121,000 --> 0:09:33,000
another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,

219
0:09:33.453,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.

220
0:09:36.873,000 --> 0:09:38,000
As the name suggests -- the cold chain --

221
0:09:39.547,000 --> 0:09:41,000
it's the requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production

222
0:09:42.487,000 --> 0:09:44,000
all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,

223
0:09:45.163,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to keep it refrigerated.

224
0:09:48.261,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now, that presents some logistical challenges

225
0:09:51.507,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but we have ways to do it.

226
0:09:54.497,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is a slightly extreme case in point

227
0:09:59.033,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,

228
0:10:01.516,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in particular in resource-poor settings,

229
0:10:03.906,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of what's required to get vaccines

230
0:10:07.192,000 --> 0:10:08,000
refrigerated and maintain the cold chain.

231
0:10:08.91,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,

232
0:10:12.724,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but interestingly it can be too cold

233
0:10:14.931,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and the vaccine can break down as well.

234
0:10:17.492,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now, the stakes are very high.

235
0:10:20.874,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The WHO estimates that within Africa,

236
0:10:23.409,000 --> 0:10:25,000
up to half the vaccines used there

237
0:10:26.06,000 --> 0:10:27,000
are considered to not be working properly

238
0:10:27.913,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because at some point the cold chain has fallen over.

239
0:10:30.903,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So it's a big problem, and it's tied in with the needle and syringe

240
0:10:33.469,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because it's a liquid form vaccine, and when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.

241
0:10:38.702,000 --> 0:10:4,000
A key attribute of our Nanopatch

242
0:10:41.213,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is that the vaccine is dry,

243
0:10:43.186,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.

244
0:10:45.975,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Within my lab we've shown that we can keep

245
0:10:48.387,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius

246
0:10:51.067,000 --> 0:10:54,000
for more than a year without any loss in activity at all.

247
0:10:54.783,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That's an important improvement.

248
0:10:57.17,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

249
0:11:03.77,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We're delighted about it as well.

250
0:11:06.233,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven

251
0:11:10.529,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.

252
0:11:13.192,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And as a scientist, I love that and I love science.

253
0:11:17.165,000 --> 0:11:19,000
However, as an engineer,

254
0:11:19.673,000 --> 0:11:2,000
as a biomedical engineer

255
0:11:21.386,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and also as a human being,

256
0:11:23.589,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I'm not going to be satisfied

257
0:11:24.82,000 --> 0:11:26,000
until we've rolled this thing out, taken it out of the lab

258
0:11:27.513,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and got it to people in large numbers

259
0:11:29.944,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and particularly the people that need it the most.

260
0:11:33.48,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So we've commenced this particular journey,

261
0:11:36.182,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and we've commenced this journey in an unusual way.

262
0:11:38.843,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We've started with Papua New Guinea.

263
0:11:41.832,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now, Papua New Guinea is an example of a developing world country.

264
0:11:47.637,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's about the same size as France,

265
0:11:50.773,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but it suffers from many of the key barriers

266
0:11:53.608,000 --> 0:11:57,000
existing within the world of today's vaccines.

267
0:11:57.676,000 --> 0:11:58,000
There's the logistics:

268
0:11:59.289,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Within this country there are only 800 refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.

269
0:12:03.647,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby, many of them are breaking down

270
0:12:07.94,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and many are not in the Highlands where they are required.

271
0:12:10.856,000 --> 0:12:11,000
That's a challenge.

272
0:12:12.319,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But also, Papua New Guinea has the world's highest incidence of HPV,

273
0:12:17.502,000 --> 0:12:21,000
human papillomavirus, the cervical cancer [risk factor].

274
0:12:21.733,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers

275
0:12:24.434,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because it's too expensive.

276
0:12:26.348,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So for those two reasons, with the attributes of the Nanopatch,

277
0:12:29.094,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we've got into the field and worked with the Nanopatch,

278
0:12:31.709,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and taken it to Papua New Guinea

279
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and we'll be following that up shortly.

280
0:12:38.143,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, doing this kind of work is not easy.

281
0:12:41.625,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's challenging,

282
0:12:42.973,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but there's nothing else in the world I'd rather be doing.

283
0:12:46.297,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And as we look ahead

284
0:12:48.32,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I'd like to share with you a thought:

285
0:12:52.062,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's the thought of a future where

286
0:12:56.07,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the 17 million deaths per year

287
0:12:58.003,000 --> 0:13:,000
that we currently have due to infectious disease

288
0:13:00.347,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is a historical footnote.

289
0:13:02.981,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved

290
0:13:05.077,000 --> 0:13:08,000
by improved, radically improved vaccines.

291
0:13:08.545,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Now standing here today in front of you

292
0:13:10.828,000 --> 0:13:11,000
at the birthplace of the needle and syringe,

293
0:13:12.501,000 --> 0:13:14,000
a device that's 160 years old,

294
0:13:15.298,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I'm presenting to you an alternative approach

295
0:13:17.634,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that could really help make that happen --

296
0:13:19.883,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes of being needle-free, pain-free,

297
0:13:23.865,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity.

298
0:13:28.296,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you.

299
0:13:30.249,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

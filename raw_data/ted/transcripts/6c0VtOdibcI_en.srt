1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have spent the past few years

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
putting myself into situations

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that are usually very difficult

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and at the same time somewhat dangerous.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I went to prison --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
difficult.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I worked in a coal mine --

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
dangerous.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I filmed in war zones --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
difficult and dangerous.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
fun in the beginning,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In fact, most of my career,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I've been immersing myself

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
into seemingly horrible situations

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the whole goal of trying

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
to examine societal issues

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that hopefully break them down in a way

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So when I knew I was coming here

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I knew I would want to do something a little different.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So as some of you may or may not have heard,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I sent out some Facebook messages,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
some Twitter messages,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to my 2011 TED Talk.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That's right, some lucky individual, corporation,

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for-profit or non-profit,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity --

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again --

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to buy the naming rights

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to the talk you're watching right now,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and didn't really give much hint

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as to what the subject matter would actually be.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what you were getting was this:

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Your name here presents:

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But that being said,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
it's a very good media opportunity.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You know how many people watch these TED Talks?

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's a lot.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's just a working title, by the way.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So even with that caveat,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we examine the world of marketing, advertising.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And as I said earlier,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for anything as difficult

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or as dangerous

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as going into the rooms with these guys.

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You see, I had this idea for a movie.

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
all about product placement, marketing and advertising,

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
where the entire film is funded

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
by product placement, marketing and advertising.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is branded from beginning to end --

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which is brand X.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the Staples Center ...

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
That was more for emphasis.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever."

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The goal of this whole film is transparency.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So that's the whole concept,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the whole film, start to finish.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because when I first hear it,

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it is the ultimate respect

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
for an audience.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Guy: I don't know how receptive

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
people are going to be to it, though.

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
XK: Do you have a perspective --

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but I think it's certainly worth pursuing

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a couple big, really obvious brands.

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
MS: What do you think the response is going to be?

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or a tough sell because of me?

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
JK: Both.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So, sir, can you help me? I need help.

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
MK: I can help you.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
MS: Okay. (MK: Good.)

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Awesome.

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When you look at the people you deal with ..

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Turn the camera off.

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off"

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Turns out it really means,

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"We want nothing to do with your movie."

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
MS: And just like that, one by one,

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
all of these companies suddenly disappeared.

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I was amazed.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to get as many people to see it as possible.

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Especially in today's world,

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
this intersection of new media and old media

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and the fractured media landscape,

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
isn't the idea to get

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that's going to get that message to the masses?

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
No, that's what I thought.

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But the problem was, you see,

151
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
my idea had one fatal flaw,

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and that flaw was this.

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This would have been fine.

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But what this image represents was the problem.

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
this is ---

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

160
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Applause)

161
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This is one of the first images that comes up.

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.

163
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This is was the problem: transparency --

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
free from pretense or deceit;

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
easily detected or seen through;

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
readily understood;

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
especially concerning business practices --

170
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that last line being probably the biggest problem.

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Our politicians say it, our president says it,

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
even our CEO's say it.

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,

175
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
something suddenly changes.

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But why? Well, transparency is scary --

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Roar)

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
like that odd, still-screaming bear.

179
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

180
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's unpredictable --

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Music)

182
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

183
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
like this odd country road.

184
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And it's also very risky.

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

186
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
What else is risky?

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
That's very risky.

190
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now when I started talking to companies

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We want you to tell a story,

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but we just want to tell our story."

195
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
See, when I was a kid

196
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --

197
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.

199
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There's your story,

200
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
there's my story

201
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and there's the real story."

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I realized that I would have to go on my own,

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I'd have to cut out the middleman

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and go to the companies myself with all of my team.

208
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So what you suddenly started to realize --

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
or what I started to realize --

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is that when you started having conversations with these companies,

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
say the reason their films are so successful

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
is because of the brand partners that they have.

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And then my friends who make small independent films

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete

219
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"

220
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the movie is called

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?

223
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you will see Ban deodorant.

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
While anytime I do an interview with someone,

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I want to help you calm down.

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So maybe you should put some one before the interview."

230
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
they'll have their chance.

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We will have them geared for both male or female --

234
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's the two-cent tour.

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So now I can answer any of your questions

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and give you the five-cent tour.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,

240
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we're very much a challenger brand.

241
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.

242
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So doing things like this -- you know,

243
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
remind people about Ban --

244
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is kind of why were interested in it.

245
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?

246
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Ban is blank.

247
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
KF: That's a great question.

248
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Woman: Superior technology.

250
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
somebody's putting in their armpit.

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Man: We talk about bold, fresh.

253
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,

254
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
versus "fights odor and wetness."

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It keeps you fresh.

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
more freshness, three times fresher.

258
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.

259
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What about me? What about a regular guy?

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I need to go talk to the man on the street,

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the people who are like me, the regular Joes.

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They need to tell me about my brand.

264
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?

265
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Man: Um, my brand?

266
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I don't know.

267
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I like really nice clothes.

268
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Woman: 80's revival

269
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
meets skater-punk,

270
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
unless it's laundry day.

271
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?

272
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)

273
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
would be like dark glamor.

275
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I like a lot of black colors,

276
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
a lot of grays and stuff like that.

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But usually I have an accessory,

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
like sunglasses,

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or I like crystal and things like that too.

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Woman: If Dan were a brand,

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
he might be a classic convertible

282
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Mercedes Benz.

283
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Man 2: The brand that I am

284
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is, I would call it casual fly.

285
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,

286
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.

287
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.

289
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So I guess that's my brand.

290
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.

291
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.

292
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.

293
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Is that something?

294
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.

295
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Tom: I'm Tom.

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself

297
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.

298
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

299
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And what I realized is I needed an expert.

300
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I needed somebody who could get inside my head,

301
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
somebody who could really help me understand

302
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
what they call your "brand personality."

303
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.

304
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark

305
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
discover that brand personality.

306
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.

307
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?

308
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
MS: I did. The very first picture

309
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is a picture of my family.

310
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.

311
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.

312
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
A: Tell me about this world.

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --

314
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
like people who are around you, your friends, your family,

315
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the way you live your life, the job you do.

316
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
All those things stemmed and started from one place,

317
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.

318
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?

319
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.

320
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?

321
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
MS: It's like, who do I want to be?

322
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I like things that are different.

323
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I like things that are weird. I like weird things.

324
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?

325
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?

326
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?

327
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Tell me a little bit about that part.

328
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
... A little more about you that is not who you are.

329
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?

330
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?

331
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.

332
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)

333
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.

334
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.

335
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that you had two distinct, but complementary

338
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
sides to your brand personality --

339
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.

340
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.

341
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.

342
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I think some companies

343
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
will just focus on one of their strengths or the other

344
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
instead of focusing on both.

345
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --

346
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to avoid things that they're not sure of,

347
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
avoid fear, those elements,

348
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and you really embrace those,

349
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.

350
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What other brands are like that?

351
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The first on here is the classic, Apple.

352
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And you can see here too, Target, Wii,

353
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.

354
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,

355
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
those things that have come and gone,

356
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.

357
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?

358
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,

359
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
what would you be?

360
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?

361
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Or are you more of a down attribute?

362
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?

363
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Up attributes are things like being playful,

364
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
being fresh like the Fresh Prince,

365
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
contemporary, adventurous,

366
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,

367
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
nimble or agile, profane, domineering,

368
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
magical or mystical like Gandalf.

369
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Or are you more of a down attribute?

370
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?

371
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,

372
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
empathetic like the Oprah?

373
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Are you reliable, stable, familiar,

374
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
safe, secure, sacred,

375
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
contemplative or wise

376
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?

377
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Over the course of this film,

378
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
we had 500-plus companies

379
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
who were up and down companies

380
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.

381
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,

382
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
they would have no control over the final product.

383
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But we did get 17 brand partners

384
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
who were willing to relinquish that control,

385
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
who wanted to be in business

386
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
with someone as mindful and as playful as myself

387
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories

388
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that normally we wouldn't be able to tell --

389
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.

390
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,

391
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
as we got into telling the story in this film

392
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
about how now they're using MRI's

393
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to target the desire centers of your brain

394
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
for both commercials as well as movie marketing.

395
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.

396
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
In the entire city for the past five years,

397
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.

398
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

399
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And we went to school districts

400
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where now companies are making their way

401
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
into cash-strapped schools all across America.

402
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,

403
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
or I've had the most success in,

404
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
are ones where I've interacted with things directly.

405
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And that's what these brands did.

406
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies

407
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and said, "Maybe these agencies

408
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
don't have my best interest in mind.

409
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.

410
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I'm going to work with him to create something different,

411
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
something that's going to get people thinking,

412
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."

413
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?

414
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.

415
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,

416
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --

417
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.

418
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.

419
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
That's only online -- no print, no TV.

420
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.

421
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.

422
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.

423
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So ultimately,

424
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.

425
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to

426
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
advised their clients not to take part.

427
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
What I always believe

428
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
is that if you take chances, if you take risks,

429
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that in those risks will come opportunity.

430
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I believe that when you push people away from that,

431
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
you're pushing them more towards failure.

432
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,

433
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
then you're preparing your whole company

434
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to be reward challenged.

435
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward

436
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is we need to encourage people to take risks.

437
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
We need to encourage people to not be afraid

438
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
of opportunities that may scare them.

439
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Ultimately, moving forward,

440
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
I think we have to embrace fear.

441
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
We've got to put that bear in a cage.

442
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

443
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Embrace fear. Embrace risk.

444
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.

445
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.

446
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Today, more than ever,

447
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
a little honesty is going to go a long way.

448
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And that being said, through honesty and transparency,

449
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"

450
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
has been brought to you

451
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
by my good friends at EMC,

452
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
who for $7,100

453
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
bought the naming rights on eBay.

454
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
(Applause)

455
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
EMC: Turning big data

456
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
into big opportunity

457
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
for organizations all over the world.

458
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."

459
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Thank you very much, guys.

460
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
(Applause)

461
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
June Cohen: So, Morgan,

462
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
in the name of transparency,

463
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
what exactly happened to that $7,100?

464
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
MS: That is a fantastic question.

465
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
I have in my pocket a check

466
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
made out to the parent organization to the TED organization,

467
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
the Sapling Foundation --

468
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
a check for $7,100

469
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.

470
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
(Laughter)

471
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
(Applause)

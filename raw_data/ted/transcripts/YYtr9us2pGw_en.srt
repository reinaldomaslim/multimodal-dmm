In 1962, Buckminster Fuller

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform

6
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and deeply affect the decision making of this body

7
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
through animations of global data, trends

8
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.

9
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And today, 45 years later,

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,

11
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
but what we do have is improved technology.

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.

13
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We can use LEDs.

14
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.

15
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Most importantly for this, they're faster.

16
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,

17
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,

18
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.

19
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.

20
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.

21
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.

22
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There are four on-board micro-controllers

23
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that, each time this ring rotates

24
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it, as it passes the rear of the display,

25
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it picks up a position signal.

26
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And from that, the on-board micro-controllers

27
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution

28
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.

29
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But this is really just the beginning.

30
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,

31
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design

32
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.

33
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.

34
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.

35
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
These blocks represent LEDs.

36
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,

37
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it will create a disc of light that we can control.

38
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;

39
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that's the rims that you can buy for your car.

40
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,

41
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.

42
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And so we can control that with micro-controllers

43
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.

44
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now this piece is currently in process --

45
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,

46
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.

47
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I've got a little video to show you,

48
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,

49
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and this is also with only four LEDs.

50
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.

51
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, take a look.

52
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.

53
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then, as the other axis kicks in,

54
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
those actually blur into a volume.

55
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the shutter speed of the camera

56
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.

57
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But this piece is due out in May.

58
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show

59
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,

60
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.

61
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.

62
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This piece, actually, will be on display

63
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge

64
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in the breaks between now and the end of the show.

65
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you

66
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to come down and take a closer look.

67
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.

68
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Let me introduce to you Rezero.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This little fellow was developed

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
by a group of 10 undergraduate students

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
at ETH-Zurich.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Our robot belongs to a family of robots

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
called Ballbots.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and moving on one single ball.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The main characteristics of such a system is

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that there's one sole contact point to the ground.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This means that the robot

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is inherently unstable.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's like when I am trying to stand

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
on one foot.

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of a robot that's unstable?

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now we'll explain that in a second.

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me first explain how Rezero

20
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
actually keeps his balance.

21
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly

22
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.

23
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
by turning the motors appropriately.

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This happens 160 times per second,

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and if anything fails in this process,

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now to move and to balance,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Rezero needs to turn the ball.

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The ball is driven by three special wheels

31
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that allow Rezero to move into any direction

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and also move around his own axis

33
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
at the same time.

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Due to his instability, Rezero is always

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in motion. Now here's the trick.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a robot to move very [dynamically].

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Let's play a little.

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You may have wondered what happens

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
if I give the robot a little push.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In this mode, he's trying to maintain

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
his position.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and Thomas who's helping me onstage.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In the next mode, Rezero is passive,

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and we can move him around.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
With almost no force I can control

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
his position and his velocity.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I can also make him spin.

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In the next mode, we can get Rezero

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to follow a person.

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.

54
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This works with a laser sensor

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that's mounted on top of Rezero.

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
With the same method, we can also

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
get him to circle a person.

58
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We call this the orbiting mode.

59
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
All right, thank you, Thomas.

60
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, what's the use of this technology?

62
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
For now, it's an experiment, but let me

63
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
show you some possible future applications.

64
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.

65
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
With a screen it could inform people or show

66
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
them around in a fun and entertaining way.

67
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In a hospital, this device could be used to

68
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
carry around medical equipment.

69
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small

70
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
footprint and it's also easy to move around.

71
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And of course, who wouldn't like

72
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to take a ride on one of these.

73
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And these are more practical applications.

74
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But there's also a certain beauty

75
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
within this technology.

76
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Music)

77
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

78
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Thank you.

79
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

80
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Thank you.

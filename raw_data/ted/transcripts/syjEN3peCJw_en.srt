1
0:00:12.934,000 --> 0:00:13,000
The day I left home for the first time

2
0:00:14.791,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to go to university was a bright day

3
0:00:16.971,000 --> 0:00:18,000
brimming with hope and optimism.

4
0:00:19.516,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high,

5
0:00:22.463,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I gleefully entered the student life

6
0:00:24.638,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.

7
0:00:28.236,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now appearances, of course, can be deceptive,

8
0:00:30.914,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona

9
0:00:34.029,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer,

10
0:00:37.184,000 --> 0:00:4,000
albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one.

11
0:00:40.223,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Underneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure

12
0:00:43.649,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and fundamentally frightened --

13
0:00:45.863,000 --> 0:00:48,000
frightened of other people, of the future, of failure

14
0:00:49.486,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and of the emptiness that I felt was within me.

15
0:00:51.839,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside

16
0:00:54.34,000 --> 0:00:56,000
appeared to be someone with everything to hope for

17
0:00:56.745,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and aspire to.

18
0:00:57.996,000 --> 0:01:,000
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete

19
0:01:01.202,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that I even deceived myself,

20
0:01:02.914,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and as the first semester ended and the second began,

21
0:01:05.462,000 --> 0:01:07,000
there was no way that anyone could have predicted

22
0:01:07.994,000 --> 0:01:09,000
what was just about to happen.

23
0:01:10.617,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I was leaving a seminar when it started,

24
0:01:13.75,000 --> 0:01:15,000
humming to myself, fumbling with my bag

25
0:01:15.911,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just as I'd done a hundred times before,

26
0:01:18.334,000 --> 0:01:2,000
when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe,

27
0:01:20.81,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"She is leaving the room."

28
0:01:23.002,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I looked around, and there was no one there,

29
0:01:24.417,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment

30
0:01:27.091,000 --> 0:01:28,000
was unmistakable.

31
0:01:28.935,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Shaken, I left my books on the stairs and hurried home,

32
0:01:31.579,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and there it was again.

33
0:01:32.818,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"She is opening the door."

34
0:01:34.881,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This was the beginning. The voice had arrived.

35
0:01:38.853,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And the voice persisted,

36
0:01:41.1,000 --> 0:01:43,000
days and then weeks of it, on and on,

37
0:01:43.565,000 --> 0:01:45,000
narrating everything I did in the third person.

38
0:01:45.828,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"She is going to the library."

39
0:01:47.486,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"She is going to a lecture."

40
0:01:49.081,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was neutral, impassive and even, after a while,

41
0:01:52.417,000 --> 0:01:54,000
strangely companionate and reassuring,

42
0:01:54.999,000 --> 0:01:57,000
although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped

43
0:01:58.44,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.

44
0:02:01.541,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it,

45
0:02:04.153,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt,

46
0:02:07.519,000 --> 0:02:09,000
then the voice would sound frustrated.

47
0:02:09.856,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Otherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing,

48
0:02:12.669,000 --> 0:02:14,000
although even at that point it was clear

49
0:02:14.779,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that it had something to communicate to me

50
0:02:16.803,000 --> 0:02:18,000
about my emotions, particularly emotions

51
0:02:19.174,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which were remote and inaccessible.

52
0:02:22.259,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake,

53
0:02:25.383,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in that I told a friend about the voice, and she was horrified.

54
0:02:28.586,000 --> 0:02:3,000
A subtle conditioning process had begun,

55
0:02:30.831,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the implication that normal people don't hear voices

56
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.

57
0:02:37.878,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Such fear and mistrust was infectious.

58
0:02:41.266,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore,

59
0:02:44.331,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and when she insisted that I seek medical attention,

60
0:02:46.832,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I duly complied, and which proved to be

61
0:02:48.903,000 --> 0:02:49,000
mistake number two.

62
0:02:50.65,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I spent some time telling the college G.P.

63
0:02:52.796,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about what I perceived to be the real problem:

64
0:02:55.011,000 --> 0:02:57,000
anxiety, low self-worth, fears about the future,

65
0:02:57.867,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and was met with bored indifference

66
0:02:59.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
until I mentioned the voice,

67
0:03:01.434,000 --> 0:03:03,000
upon which he dropped his pen, swung round

68
0:03:03.458,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and began to question me with a show of real interest.

69
0:03:06.169,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help,

70
0:03:08.813,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I began to tell him about my strange commentator.

71
0:03:11.659,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I always wish, at this point, the voice had said,

72
0:03:14.207,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"She is digging her own grave."

73
0:03:15.899,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I was referred to a psychiatrist, who likewise

74
0:03:19.424,000 --> 0:03:21,000
took a grim view of the voice's presence,

75
0:03:21.981,000 --> 0:03:23,000
subsequently interpreting everything I said

76
0:03:24.053,000 --> 0:03:26,000
through a lens of latent insanity.

77
0:03:26.389,000 --> 0:03:28,000
For example, I was part of a student TV station

78
0:03:29.322,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that broadcast news bulletins around the campus,

79
0:03:31.874,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and during an appointment which was running very late,

80
0:03:33.924,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I said, "I'm sorry, doctor, I've got to go.

81
0:03:35.173,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I'm reading the news at six."

82
0:03:36.691,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor

83
0:03:39.001,000 --> 0:03:42,000
has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.

84
0:03:42.175,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It was at this point that events began

85
0:03:45.624,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to rapidly overtake me.

86
0:03:47.854,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A hospital admission followed, the first of many,

87
0:03:50.25,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,

88
0:03:53.162,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense

89
0:03:56.77,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of hopelessness, humiliation and despair

90
0:04:00.148,000 --> 0:04:02,000
about myself and my prospects.

91
0:04:02.683,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But having been encouraged to see the voice

92
0:04:05.116,000 --> 0:04:07,000
not as an experience but as a symptom,

93
0:04:07.672,000 --> 0:04:1,000
my fear and resistance towards it intensified.

94
0:04:10.768,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now essentially, this represented taking

95
0:04:12.852,000 --> 0:04:14,000
an aggressive stance towards my own mind,

96
0:04:14.904,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a kind of psychic civil war,

97
0:04:17.295,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase

98
0:04:20.229,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and grow progressively hostile and menacing.

99
0:04:23.614,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Helplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat

100
0:04:27.094,000 --> 0:04:29,000
into this nightmarish inner world

101
0:04:29.233,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in which the voices were destined to become

102
0:04:31.305,000 --> 0:04:34,000
both my persecutors and my only perceived companions.

103
0:04:35.327,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy

104
0:04:38.406,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of their help, then they could change my life

105
0:04:40.573,000 --> 0:04:41,000
back to how it had been,

106
0:04:41.77,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set,

107
0:04:44.51,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a kind of labor of Hercules.

108
0:04:46.535,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It started off quite small, for example,

109
0:04:48.496,000 --> 0:04:49,000
pull out three strands of hair,

110
0:04:50.212,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but gradually it grew more extreme,

111
0:04:51.903,000 --> 0:04:53,000
culminating in commands to harm myself,

112
0:04:54.123,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and a particularly dramatic instruction:

113
0:04:56.293,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"You see that tutor over there?

114
0:04:58.006,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You see that glass of water?

115
0:04:59.304,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."

116
0:05:02.102,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Which I actually did, and which needless to say

117
0:05:04.365,000 --> 0:05:05,000
did not endear me to the faculty.

118
0:05:06.046,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance,

119
0:05:10.35,000 --> 0:05:12,000
mistrust and misunderstanding had been established,

120
0:05:13.208,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and this was a battle in which I felt powerless

121
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.

122
0:05:20.337,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Two years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.

123
0:05:23.995,000 --> 0:05:26,000
By now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire:

124
0:05:27.703,000 --> 0:05:29,000
terrifying voices, grotesque visions,

125
0:05:30.692,000 --> 0:05:32,000
bizarre, intractable delusions.

126
0:05:33.46,000 --> 0:05:35,000
My mental health status had been a catalyst

127
0:05:35.656,000 --> 0:05:37,000
for discrimination, verbal abuse,

128
0:05:38.245,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and physical and sexual assault,

129
0:05:40.4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I'd been told by my psychiatrist,

130
0:05:42.186,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,

131
0:05:44.595,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia."

132
0:05:48.348,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,

133
0:05:51.74,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and was by now so tormented by the voices

134
0:05:53.816,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that I attempted to drill a hole in my head

135
0:05:56.021,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in order to get them out.

136
0:05:58.877,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years,

137
0:06:02.978,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it seems to me now as if someone died in that place,

138
0:06:06.048,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and yet, someone else was saved.

139
0:06:09.765,000 --> 0:06:12,000
A broken and haunted person began that journey,

140
0:06:13.079,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but the person who emerged was a survivor

141
0:06:16.012,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and would ultimately grow into the person

142
0:06:18.286,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I was destined to be.

143
0:06:20.41,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Many people have harmed me in my life,

144
0:06:23.098,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I remember them all,

145
0:06:24.592,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but the memories grow pale and faint

146
0:06:27.393,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in comparison with the people who've helped me.

147
0:06:31.085,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The fellow survivors, the fellow voice-hearers,

148
0:06:33.705,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the comrades and collaborators;

149
0:06:35.977,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the mother who never gave up on me,

150
0:06:38.305,000 --> 0:06:4,000
who knew that one day I would come back to her

151
0:06:40.913,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took;

152
0:06:44.583,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time

153
0:06:47.12,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but who reinforced his belief that recovery

154
0:06:49.192,000 --> 0:06:51,000
was not only possible but inevitable,

155
0:06:51.506,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and during a devastating period of relapse

156
0:06:53.909,000 --> 0:06:55,000
told my terrified family, "Don't give up hope.

157
0:06:56.809,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I believe that Eleanor can get through this.

158
0:06:59.822,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Sometimes, you know, it snows as late as May,

159
0:07:02.66,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but summer always comes eventually."

160
0:07:06.086,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Fourteen minutes is not enough time

161
0:07:07.94,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to fully credit those good and generous people

162
0:07:10.876,000 --> 0:07:11,000
who fought with me and for me

163
0:07:12.853,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and who waited to welcome me back

164
0:07:14.652,000 --> 0:07:16,000
from that agonized, lonely place.

165
0:07:17.151,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But together, they forged a blend of courage,

166
0:07:19.318,000 --> 0:07:22,000
creativity, integrity, and an unshakeable belief

167
0:07:22.904,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that my shattered self could become healed and whole.

168
0:07:26.753,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I used to say that these people saved me,

169
0:07:28.73,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but what I now know is they did something

170
0:07:30.1,000 --> 0:07:32,000
even more important in that they empowered me

171
0:07:32.671,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to save myself,

172
0:07:34.293,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and crucially, they helped me to understand something

173
0:07:36.841,000 --> 0:07:37,000
which I'd always suspected:

174
0:07:38.421,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that my voices were a meaningful response

175
0:07:40.809,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to traumatic life events, particularly childhood events,

176
0:07:43.759,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and as such were not my enemies

177
0:07:45.608,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems.

178
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, at first, this was very difficult to believe,

179
0:07:53.43,000 --> 0:07:55,000
not least because the voices appeared so hostile

180
0:07:55.804,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step

181
0:07:59.15,000 --> 0:08:01,000
was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning

182
0:08:01.865,000 --> 0:08:04,000
from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.

183
0:08:05.643,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So for example, voices which threatened to attack my home

184
0:08:08.793,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear

185
0:08:11.522,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger.

186
0:08:15.18,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now at first, I would have believed them.

187
0:08:17.336,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I remember, for example, sitting up one night

188
0:08:18.908,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on guard outside my parents' room to protect them

189
0:08:21.378,000 --> 0:08:24,000
from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.

190
0:08:24.622,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Because I'd had such a bad problem with self-injury

191
0:08:27.136,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden,

192
0:08:29.732,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork,

193
0:08:32.226,000 --> 0:08:34,000
kind of like picnic ware, and sort of sat outside the room

194
0:08:35.012,000 --> 0:08:38,000
clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen.

195
0:08:38.726,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It was like, "Don't mess with me.

196
0:08:40.398,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"

197
0:08:43.131,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Strategic.

198
0:08:44.611,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But a later response, and much more useful,

199
0:08:47.217,000 --> 0:08:51,000
would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words,

200
0:08:51.635,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so when the voices warned me not to leave the house,

201
0:08:54.657,000 --> 0:08:56,000
then I would thank them for drawing my attention

202
0:08:56.733,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to how unsafe I felt --

203
0:08:57.95,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it --

204
0:09:00.843,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but go on to reassure both them and myself

205
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.

206
0:09:06.829,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I would set boundaries for the voices,

207
0:09:08.318,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive

208
0:09:11.057,000 --> 0:09:13,000
yet respectful, establishing a slow process

209
0:09:13.313,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of communication and collaboration

210
0:09:15.669,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in which we could learn to work together and support one another.

211
0:09:18.968,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Throughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize

212
0:09:21.612,000 --> 0:09:22,000
was that each voice was closely related

213
0:09:23.496,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to aspects of myself, and that each of them

214
0:09:25.805,000 --> 0:09:27,000
carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had

215
0:09:28.115,000 --> 0:09:3,000
an opportunity to process or resolve,

216
0:09:30.193,000 --> 0:09:32,000
memories of sexual trauma and abuse,

217
0:09:32.753,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.

218
0:09:35.664,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The voices took the place of this pain

219
0:09:38.164,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and gave words to it,

220
0:09:39.651,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and possibly one of the greatest revelations

221
0:09:41.49,000 --> 0:09:44,000
was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices

222
0:09:44.514,000 --> 0:09:45,000
actually represented the parts of me

223
0:09:46.261,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that had been hurt most profoundly,

224
0:09:48.474,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and as such, it was these voices

225
0:09:50.626,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.

226
0:09:53.968,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately

227
0:09:56.983,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I would gather together my shattered self,

228
0:09:59.271,000 --> 0:10:01,000
each fragment represented by a different voice,

229
0:10:01.886,000 --> 0:10:03,000
gradually withdraw from all my medication,

230
0:10:03.937,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.

231
0:10:08.625,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Ten years after the voice first came, I finally graduated,

232
0:10:12.223,000 --> 0:10:13,000
this time with the highest degree in psychology

233
0:10:14.117,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the university had ever given, and one year later,

234
0:10:16.575,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the highest masters, which shall we say

235
0:10:18.457,000 --> 0:10:19,000
isn't bad for a madwoman.

236
0:10:20.18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In fact, one of the voices actually dictated the answers

237
0:10:22.871,000 --> 0:10:25,000
during the exam, which technically possibly counts as cheating.

238
0:10:26.101,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:27.502,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And to be honest, sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well.

240
0:10:30.236,000 --> 0:10:32,000
As Oscar Wilde has said, the only thing worse

241
0:10:32.403,000 --> 0:10:34,000
than being talked about is not being talked about.

242
0:10:34.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It also makes you very good at eavesdropping,

243
0:10:37.087,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously.

244
0:10:39.921,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So it's not all bad.

245
0:10:41.21,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I worked in mental health services,

246
0:10:42.901,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I spoke at conferences,

247
0:10:45.122,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I published book chapters and academic articles,

248
0:10:47.432,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and I argued, and continue to do so,

249
0:10:50.222,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the relevance of the following concept:

250
0:10:52.466,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that an important question in psychiatry

251
0:10:54.718,000 --> 0:10:55,000
shouldn't be what's wrong with you

252
0:10:56.362,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but rather what's happened to you.

253
0:10:58.966,000 --> 0:11:,000
And all the while, I listened to my voices,

254
0:11:01.828,000 --> 0:11:03,000
with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect

255
0:11:04.71,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and which in turn reflected a growing sense

256
0:11:06.828,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.

257
0:11:10.491,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment

258
0:11:13.649,000 --> 0:11:16,000
when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices,

259
0:11:16.959,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and becoming fully aware, for the very first time,

260
0:11:19.558,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that I no longer felt that way myself

261
0:11:21.854,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but was finally able to help someone else who was.

262
0:11:25.578,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice,

263
0:11:29.146,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement,

264
0:11:33.115,000 --> 0:11:36,000
an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme

265
0:11:36.498,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and Dr. Sandra Escher,

266
0:11:37.75,000 --> 0:11:4,000
which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy,

267
0:11:40.946,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a sane reaction to insane circumstances,

268
0:11:44.312,000 --> 0:11:47,000
not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured,

269
0:11:47.971,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but a complex, significant and meaningful experience

270
0:11:51.235,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to be explored.

271
0:11:53.559,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Together, we envisage and enact a society

272
0:11:55.842,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that understands and respects voice hearing,

273
0:11:58.319,000 --> 0:12:,000
supports the needs of individuals who hear voices,

274
0:12:00.724,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and which values them as full citizens.

275
0:12:04.005,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This type of society is not only possible,

276
0:12:06.291,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it's already on its way.

277
0:12:08.303,000 --> 0:12:11,000
To paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins,

278
0:12:12.097,000 --> 0:12:14,000
it cannot be reversed.

279
0:12:14.189,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.

280
0:12:17.416,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You cannot oppress the people

281
0:12:19.207,000 --> 0:12:21,000
who are not afraid anymore.

282
0:12:21.691,000 --> 0:12:23,000
For me, the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement

283
0:12:24.335,000 --> 0:12:26,000
are a reminder that empathy, fellowship,

284
0:12:26.769,000 --> 0:12:28,000
justice and respect are more than words;

285
0:12:29.513,000 --> 0:12:31,000
they are convictions and beliefs,

286
0:12:32.124,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and that beliefs can change the world.

287
0:12:34.61,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement

288
0:12:37.385,000 --> 0:12:39,000
has established hearing voices networks

289
0:12:39.597,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in 26 countries across five continents,

290
0:12:42.588,000 --> 0:12:45,000
working together to promote dignity, solidarity

291
0:12:45.957,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and empowerment for individuals in mental distress,

292
0:12:49.023,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to create a new language and practice of hope,

293
0:12:52.288,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief

294
0:12:56.232,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in the power of the individual.

295
0:12:59.122,000 --> 0:13:01,000
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal

296
0:13:02.043,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is a unique being

297
0:13:03.695,000 --> 0:13:06,000
endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal

298
0:13:07.069,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.

299
0:13:11.28,000 --> 0:13:13,000
In this respect, for members of society,

300
0:13:13.764,000 --> 0:13:15,000
there is no greater honor or privilege

301
0:13:16.257,000 --> 0:13:18,000
than facilitating that process of healing for someone,

302
0:13:18.917,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to bear witness, to reach out a hand,

303
0:13:21.863,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to share the burden of someone's suffering,

304
0:13:24.226,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and to hold the hope for their recovery.

305
0:13:27.3,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And likewise, for survivors of distress and adversity,

306
0:13:29.896,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that we remember we don't have to live our lives

307
0:13:32.408,000 --> 0:13:35,000
forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us.

308
0:13:36.12,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We are unique. We are irreplaceable.

309
0:13:38.629,000 --> 0:13:4,000
What lies within us can never be truly colonized,

310
0:13:41.346,000 --> 0:13:43,000
contorted, or taken away.

311
0:13:43.702,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The light never goes out.

312
0:13:47.8,000 --> 0:13:49,000
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me,

313
0:13:49.91,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself.

314
0:13:53.161,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Tell me about you."

1
0:00:13.56,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We live in a medication nation.

2
0:00:16.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
4.5 billion drug prescriptions will be prescribed by doctors like me

3
0:00:21.52,000 --> 0:00:22,000
this year, in the United States alone.

4
0:00:23.36,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's 15 for every man, woman and child.

5
0:00:25.8,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And for most of us,

6
0:00:27.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
our experience with this medication is often a confusing number of pills,

7
0:00:30.6,000 --> 0:00:33,000
instructions, side effects, one-size-fits-all dosing,

8
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which all too often we aren't taking as prescribed.

9
0:00:36.72,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And this comes at tremendous expense,

10
0:00:38.76,000 --> 0:00:4,000
costing us our time, our money and our health.

11
0:00:41.68,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And in our now exponential, connected, data-driven age,

12
0:00:44.6,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I think we can and we must do better.

13
0:00:47.88,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So let's take a dive at some of the challenges we have

14
0:00:51.04,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and some potential solutions.

15
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let's start with the fact

16
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that many drugs don't work for those who are prescribed them.

17
0:00:58.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The top 10 grossing drugs in the United States this year,

18
0:01:03.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they only benefit one in four to one in 23 of who take them.

19
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:1,000
That's great if you're number one, but what about everybody else?

20
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And what's worse, drugs, when they sometimes don't work,

21
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:15,000
can still cause side effects.

22
0:01:15.52,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Take aspirin -- about one in four of us

23
0:01:17.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
who take aspirin to reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease

24
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are unknowingly aspirin-resistant

25
0:01:22.4,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and still have the same risks of gastrointestinal bleeds

26
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that kill thousands every year.

27
0:01:28.04,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's adverse drug reactions like these

28
0:01:31.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that are, by some estimates, the number four leading cause of death

29
0:01:34.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in the United States.

30
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
My own grandfather passed away

31
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:39,000
after a single dose of antibiotic caused his kidneys to fail.

32
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, adverse drug reactions and side effects

33
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are often tied to challenges in dosing.

34
0:01:46.04,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I trained in pediatrics (little people) and internal medicine (big people).

35
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So one night I might have been on call in the NICU,

36
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
carefully dosing to the fraction of a milligram

37
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
a medication for a NICU baby.

38
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The next night -- on call in the emergency room,

39
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:02:01,000
treating a 400-pound lineman or a frail nursing-home patient

40
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
who, by most accounts, usually would get the same dose of medications

41
0:02:05.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from the formulary.

42
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Which would mean, most of the time I would be underdosing the lineman

43
0:02:10.4,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and overdosing the nursing-home patient.

44
0:02:13.44,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And beyond age and weight,

45
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we tend to ignore differences in sex and race in dosing.

46
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, beyond this, we know we have a massive challenge

47
0:02:22.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with noncompliance or low adherence.

48
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Many of us who need to take our medications

49
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
aren't taking them or are taking them incorrectly.

50
0:02:30.08,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You know, 40 percent of adults in the US over 65

51
0:02:32.8,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are on five or more prescription medications.

52
0:02:35.28,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Sometimes 15 or more.

53
0:02:36.64,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And even small improvements in adherence can dramatically save dollars and lives.

54
0:02:43.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, as we think into the future,

55
0:02:46.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you think that where we are today,

56
0:02:48.32,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as we often hear about smart, personalized, targeted drugs,

57
0:02:52.32,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Internet of Things, gene therapy, AI,

58
0:02:54.24,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that we'd already arrived in this era of precision medicine.

59
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
In reality, we still live in an age

60
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:03:,000
of empiric, trial-and-error, imprecision medicine.

61
0:03:01.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I think we can do better.

62
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What if we could reimagine ways to help make your medicine-taking easier?

63
0:03:07.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
To get the right doses and combinations to match you?

64
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
What if we could move beyond today's literal cutting edge

65
0:03:13.88,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of pill cutters and fax machines,

66
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to an era where we could have better outcomes, lower costs,

67
0:03:19.52,000 --> 0:03:22,000
saving lives and space in your medicine cabinet?

68
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Well, I think part of the solution is all the emerging ways

69
0:03:26.28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that we can measure and connect our health care information.

70
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Today, we pretty much live in a reactive, sick-care world,

71
0:03:32.88,000 --> 0:03:34,000
siloed information that doesn't flow.

72
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We have the potential to move into a more continuous, real-time

73
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
proactive world of true health care.

74
0:03:40.44,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And part of that starts with the emerging world of quantified self.

75
0:03:43.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We can measure so much of our physiology and behaviors today,

76
0:03:46.92,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and often it's siloed on our phones and scales,

77
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but it's starting to connect to our clinicians, our caregivers,

78
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so they can better optimize prevention, diagnostics and therapy.

79
0:03:56.84,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And when we can do that, we can do some interesting things.

80
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Take, for example, hypertension.

81
0:04:01.84,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's the number one risk factor for early death and morbidity worldwide.

82
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Half of adult Americans, on approximation, have hypertension.

83
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Less than half have it well-controlled.

84
0:04:11.04,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's often because it takes two or three different classes of medications.

85
0:04:14.541,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's tough to do adherence and adjust your blood pressure medications.

86
0:04:17.88,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We have 500 preventable deaths from noncontrolled hypertension

87
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the US every day.

88
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But now we're in the era of connected blood pressure cuffs --

89
0:04:25.802,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the FDA just approved a blood pressure cuff

90
0:04:27.88,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that can go into your watch.

91
0:04:29.56,000 --> 0:04:32,000
There are now prototypes of cuffless radar-based blood pressure devices

92
0:04:33.079,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that can continuously stream your blood pressure.

93
0:04:35.76,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So, in the future, I could --

94
0:04:37.24,000 --> 0:04:39,000
instead of spot-checking my blood pressure in the clinic,

95
0:04:39.931,000 --> 0:04:41,000
my doctor could see my real-time numbers and my trends,

96
0:04:42.531,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and adjust them as necessary,

97
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with the help of a blood pressure dosing algorithm

98
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or using the Internet of Things.

99
0:04:49.52,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, technology today can do even more.

100
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My smartwatch, already today, has an EKG built in

101
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that can be read by artificial intelligence.

102
0:04:58.68,000 --> 0:05:,000
I'm wearing a small, Band-Aid-sized patch,

103
0:05:01.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that is live-streaming my vital signs right now.

104
0:05:03.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Let's take a look.

105
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They're actually a little concerning at the moment.

106
0:05:07.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:09.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, it's not just my real-time vitals

108
0:05:12.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that can be seen by my medical team or myself,

109
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it could be my retrospective data,

110
0:05:16.28,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and again, that'd be used to modify dosing and medication going forward.

111
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Even my weight can be super-quantified;

112
0:05:22.72,000 --> 0:05:26,000
my weight, now my shape, how much body mass, fat,

113
0:05:27.64,000 --> 0:05:28,000
muscle mass I might have,

114
0:05:28.92,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and use that to optimize my prevention or therapy.

115
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And it's not just for the tech-savvy.

116
0:05:34.64,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, MIT engineers have modified wifi

117
0:05:37.8,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so we can seamlessly connect and collect our vital signs

118
0:05:41.28,000 --> 0:05:43,000
from our connected rings and smart mattresses.

119
0:05:43.56,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We can start to share this digital exhaust, our digitome,

120
0:05:46.28,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and even potentially crowdsource it, sharing our health information

121
0:05:49.52,000 --> 0:05:51,000
just like we share with our Google Maps and driving,

122
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to improve our -- not our driving, but our health experience globally.

123
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So, that's great.

124
0:05:58.32,000 --> 0:06:,000
We can potentially now collect this information.

125
0:06:00.64,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What if your labs can go from the central lab

126
0:06:04.44,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to your home, to your phone, to even inside our bodies

127
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to measure drug levels or other varieties?

128
0:06:10.04,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And of course, we're in the age of genomics.

129
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I've been sequenced, it's just less than $1,000 today.

130
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I can start to understand my pharmacogenomics --

131
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
how my genes impact whether I need high dose, low dose,

132
0:06:20.2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
or maybe a different medication altogether.

133
0:06:22.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Let's imagine if your physician or your pharmacist

134
0:06:25.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
had this information integrated into their workflow,

135
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:3,000
augmented with artificial intelligence, AI, or as I like to refer to it, IA --

136
0:06:31.64,000 --> 0:06:32,000
intelligence augmentation,

137
0:06:33.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to leverage that information;

138
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to understand, of the 18,000 or more approved drugs,

139
0:06:37.28,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which would be the right dose and combination for you.

140
0:06:40.64,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So great, now maybe we can optimize your drugs and your doses,

141
0:06:43.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but the problem today is, we're still using this amazing technology

142
0:06:46.847,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to keep track of our drugs.

143
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And of course, these technologies evolve,

144
0:06:51.36,000 --> 0:06:54,000
there's connected dispensers, reminder apps,

145
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:57,000
smart pill bottle caps that can text or tweet you or your mother

146
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
if you haven't taken your medications.

147
0:06:59.44,000 --> 0:07:,000
PillPack was just acquired by Amazon,

148
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so soon we may have same-day delivery of our drugs, delivered by drone.

149
0:07:05.8,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, all these things are possible today,

150
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but we're still taking multiple pills.

151
0:07:09.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What if we can make it simpler?

152
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I think one of the solutions is to make better use of the polypill.

153
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:17,000
A polypill is the integration of multiple medications into a single pill.

154
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And we have these today in common over-the-counter cold and flu remedies.

155
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And there have been prevention polypill studies done,

156
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
giving combinations of statins, blood pressure, aspirin,

157
0:07:26.84,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which in randomized studies have been shown

158
0:07:28.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to dramatically reduce risk, compared to placebo.

159
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But these polypills weren't personalized, they weren't optimized to the individual.

160
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:37,000
What if we could optimize your personalized polypill?

161
0:07:37.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So it would be built for you, based on you, it could adapt to you,

162
0:07:41.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
even every single day.

163
0:07:42.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Well, we're now in the era of 3D printing. You can print personalized braces,

164
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:47,000
hearing aids, orthopedic devices,

165
0:07:48.52,000 --> 0:07:51,000
even I've been scanned and had my jeans tailored to fit to me.

166
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So this got me thinking,

167
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:56,000
what if we could 3D-print your personalized polypill?

168
0:07:56.84,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So instead of taking six medications, for example,

169
0:07:59.24,000 --> 0:08:,000
I could integrate them into one.

170
0:08:00.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So it would be easier to take, improve adherence

171
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and potentially, it could even integrate in supplements,

172
0:08:05.964,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like vitamin D or CoQ10.

173
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So with some help -- I call these "IntelliMeds" --

174
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and with the help of my IntelliMedicine engineering team,

175
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we built the first IntelliMedicine prototype printer.

176
0:08:17.92,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And here's how it works:

177
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
instead of full tablets, we have small micromeds,

178
0:08:21.56,000 --> 0:08:22,000
one or two milligrams each,

179
0:08:23.04,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which are sorted and selected based on the dose and combination

180
0:08:26.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
needed for an individual.

181
0:08:27.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And of course, these would be doses and combinations

182
0:08:30.2,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you could already take together, FDA-approved drugs.

183
0:08:32.68,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We could change the pharmacokinetics

184
0:08:34.52,000 --> 0:08:37,000
by professionally layering on different elements to the individual micromeds.

185
0:08:39.56,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And when we hit print,

186
0:08:41.24,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you print your combination of medications that might be needed by you

187
0:08:44.52,000 --> 0:08:45,000
on any individual day.

188
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we'd start with, again, generic drugs for the most common problems.

189
0:08:50.2,000 --> 0:08:53,000
About 90 percent of prescribed drugs today are low-cost generics.

190
0:08:53.88,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And once we've printed the pill, we can do some fun bells and whistles.

191
0:08:57.24,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We could print the name of the patient,

192
0:08:59.52,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the date, the day of the week, a QR code.

193
0:09:02.08,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We could print different meds for tapering for a patient on a steroid taper,

194
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or tapering from pain medications.

195
0:09:08.96,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So, this is actually a look at our prototype IntelliMedicine printer.

196
0:09:13.96,000 --> 0:09:14,000
See, I'll unveil it here.

197
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It has about 16 different silos,

198
0:09:18.92,000 --> 0:09:2,000
each containing individual micromeds.

199
0:09:22.68,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I can now adjust on the software individual dosings.

200
0:09:26.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And when I do that, the robotic arm will adjust

201
0:09:30.4,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the height of these spansules and the micromeds will release.

202
0:09:33.52,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I can now --

203
0:09:35.08,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The automated process would rotate and cycle through,

204
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to make sure the micromeds are loaded.

205
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And when I hit print,

206
0:09:41.28,000 --> 0:09:43,000
these will all fall through the device,

207
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I now pull out my personalized printed polypill

208
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with the doses and medications meant for me.

209
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And we can take a look, if you look back to the slides,

210
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you can see the whole process, we can see the drug silos being selected,

211
0:09:58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the pills doing down the different silos,

212
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and being collected in the individual capsule.

213
0:10:02.84,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now, this is great,

214
0:10:04.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I can potentially print my meds based on me,

215
0:10:06.64,000 --> 0:10:07,000
instead of taking six pills.

216
0:10:08.04,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I can now be looking at my individual dosing.

217
0:10:11.2,000 --> 0:10:13,000
My smartwatch is looking at my blood pressure:

218
0:10:13.4,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I needed an adjustment in my blood pressure medicines,

219
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
my coumadin level. My blood is too thin,

220
0:10:18.72,000 --> 0:10:21,000
so I lower my micromed dose of coumadin, a blood thinner.

221
0:10:22.32,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So, this could be smartly adapted, day to day,

222
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
programmed by my physician or cardiologist.

223
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And you can imagine that larger printers, fast printers like this,

224
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:32,000
could be in your corner pharmacy,

225
0:10:33.56,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in your doctor's office, in a rural clinic.

226
0:10:35.8,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But it could eventually merge and shrink to small ones that could be in your home

227
0:10:39.76,000 --> 0:10:42,000
with integrated cartridges like this that are delivered by drone.

228
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Could print your personalized polypill,

229
0:10:45.24,000 --> 0:10:48,000
each morning on your kitchen or your bathroom cabinet.

230
0:10:48.56,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And this could evolve, I think,

231
0:10:50.4,000 --> 0:10:53,000
into an incredible way to improve adherence in medications across the globe.

232
0:10:54.24,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, I hope we can reimagine the future of medicine in new ways,

233
0:10:58.28,000 --> 0:10:59,000
moving from polypharmacy,

234
0:10:59.84,000 --> 0:11:02,000
one-size-fits-all, low adherence, complications

235
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to an era of personalized, precise, on-demand medications

236
0:11:07.4,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that can take us and individualize our own health

237
0:11:10.8,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and health and medicine around the planet.

238
0:11:13.52,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Thank you very much.

239
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

240
0:11:21.88,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Host: Daniel, that's kind of awesome.

241
0:11:23.96,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Really cool.

242
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Question for you, though.

243
0:11:26.6,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How long is it until, say, that nursing-home patient that you mentioned

244
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is able to print their pills in their home?

245
0:11:32.76,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Daniel Kraft: Well, again, this is just a prototype.

246
0:11:35.56,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We think that the regulatory route [may] be automated compounding,

247
0:11:38.72,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and especially in nursing homes, folks are taking multiple medications,

248
0:11:41.99,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and they're often mixed up,

249
0:11:43.37,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so it would be a perfect place to start with these technologies.

250
0:11:46.37,000 --> 0:11:49,000
These aren't going to evolve and start with printers on your bathroom counter.

251
0:11:50.03,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We need to be intelligent and smart about how we roll these things out,

252
0:11:53.38,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but realizing there's so many challenges with dosing, adherence and precision,

253
0:11:57.04,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and now that we have all these amazing new technologies

254
0:11:59.61,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that can integrate and be leveraged, I think we need approaches like this

255
0:12:01.7,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to really catalyze and foster

256
0:12:04.18,000 --> 0:12:05,000
a true future of health and medicine.

257
0:12:06.02,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Host: Great, thank you. DK: Thanks.

258
0:12:08.36,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Applause)

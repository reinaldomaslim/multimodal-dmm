1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was just an ordinary Saturday.

2
0:00:15.32,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My dad was outside mowing the lawn,

3
0:00:17.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
my mom was upstairs folding laundry,

4
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my sister was in her room doing homework

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I was in the basement playing video games.

6
0:00:25.08,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And as I came upstairs to get something to drink,

7
0:00:27.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I looked out the window

8
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and realized that there was something that I was supposed to be doing,

9
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and this is what I saw.

10
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:38,000
No, this wasn't my family's dinner on fire.

11
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This was my science project.

12
0:00:42.24,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Flames were pouring out,

13
0:00:43.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
smoke was in the air

14
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire.

15
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I immediately started yelling.

16
0:00:50.04,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My mom was freaking out,

17
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
my dad ran around to put out the fire

18
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and of course my sister started recording a Snapchat video.

19
0:00:57.84,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:59.76,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This was just the beginning of my team's science project.

21
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My team is composed of me and three other students

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who are here in the audience today.

23
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

24
0:01:10.32,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which is an international LEGO robotics competition for kids,

25
0:01:13.88,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and in addition to a robotics game,

26
0:01:15.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we also worked on a separate science project,

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and this was the project that we were working on.

28
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So the idea for this project all started

29
0:01:22.88,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when a few months earlier,

30
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a couple of my teammates took a trip to Central America

31
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

32
0:01:29.52,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or expanded polystyrene foam.

33
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And when they came back and told us about it,

34
0:01:34.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Styrofoam every day.

35
0:01:37.92,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Get a new flat-screen TV?

36
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You end up with a block of Styrofoam bigger than the TV itself.

37
0:01:43.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Drink a cup of coffee?

38
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up.

39
0:01:47.76,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And where do all these items go after their one-time use?

40
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Since there aren't any good existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

41
0:01:54.6,000 --> 0:01:56,000
almost all of them end up right in the landfill,

42
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or the oceans and beaches,

43
0:01:58.52,000 --> 0:02:,000
taking over 500 years to degrade.

44
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And in fact, every year, the US alone

45
0:02:03.48,000 --> 0:02:05,000
produces over two billion pounds of Styrofoam,

46
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
filling up a staggering 25 percent of landfills.

47
0:02:09.36,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So why do we have these ghost accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

48
0:02:13.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why can't we just recycle them like many plastics?

49
0:02:16.4,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, simply put, recycled polystyrene is too expensive

50
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and potentially contaminated,

51
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:25,000
so there is very little market demand for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

52
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And as a result, Styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material,

53
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

54
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And in fact, many cities across the US

55
0:02:36.2,000 --> 0:02:37,000
have even passed ordinances

56
0:02:37.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene,

57
0:02:41.28,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which includes disposable utensils,

58
0:02:43.36,000 --> 0:02:45,000
packing peanuts, takeout containers

59
0:02:45.56,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and even plastic beach toys,

60
0:02:47.72,000 --> 0:02:49,000
all products that are very useful in today's society.

61
0:02:50.72,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And now France has become the first country

62
0:02:52.92,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

63
0:02:55.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
cups and plates.

64
0:02:57.28,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

65
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and keep benefiting from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

66
0:03:03.48,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and excellent packing ability,

67
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
while not having to suffer from the repercussions

68
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of having to dispose of it?

69
0:03:09.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What if we could turn it into something else that's actually useful?

70
0:03:12.84,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What if we could make the impossible possible?

71
0:03:16.4,000 --> 0:03:2,000
My team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

72
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to create activated carbon,

73
0:03:22.72,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is used in almost every water filter today.

74
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And activated carbon works by using very small micropores

75
0:03:29.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to filter out contaminants from water or even air.

76
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So we started out by doing a variety of heating tests,

77
0:03:36.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

78
0:03:39.64,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Literally, nothing worked.

79
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

80
0:03:44.48,000 --> 0:03:46,000
most of our samples vaporized into nothing,

81
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

82
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

83
0:03:52.44,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In fact, we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up.

84
0:03:57.36,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So why did we keep trying

85
0:03:58.72,000 --> 0:04:,000
when all the adults said it was impossible?

86
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Well, maybe it's because we're kids. We don't know any better.

87
0:04:04.779,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But the truth is, we kept trying because we thought it was still possible.

88
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We knew that if we were successful,

89
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place.

90
0:04:13.44,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So we kept trying

91
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and failing

92
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and trying

93
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and failing.

94
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We were so ready to give up.

95
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But then it happened.

96
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
With the right temperatures, times and chemicals,

97
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we finally got that successful test result

98
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:32,000
showing us that we had created activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

99
0:04:33.079,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And at that moment, the thing that had been impossible

100
0:04:35.68,000 --> 0:04:36,000
all of a sudden wasn't.

101
0:04:37.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning,

102
0:04:40.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted.

103
0:04:44.28,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And moreover, not only were we able to create activated carbon

104
0:04:47.24,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for purifying water,

105
0:04:48.52,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but we were also able to reduce Styrofoam waste,

106
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
solving two global problems with just one solution.

107
0:04:54.32,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So from then on, we were inspired to take our project further,

108
0:04:57.28,000 --> 0:04:59,000
performing more tests to make it more effective

109
0:04:59.52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and testing it in real world situations.

110
0:05:01.88,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We then proceeded to receive funding

111
0:05:03.64,000 --> 0:05:05,000
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION STEM-in-Action program

112
0:05:06.64,000 --> 0:05:07,000
sponsored by the US Army,

113
0:05:08.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

114
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
sponsored by XPRIZE.

115
0:05:12.64,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And we were also honored

116
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with the Scientific American Innovator Award

117
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from Google Science Fair.

118
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And using these funds, we plan to file a full patent on our process

119
0:05:21.96,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and to continue to work on our project.

120
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So yes, although we started with catching my dad's grill on fire

121
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and failing so many times that we almost quit,

122
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it was well worth it when we look back at it now.

123
0:05:33.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We took a problem that many people said was impossible

124
0:05:36.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and we made it possible,

125
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work.

126
0:05:41.36,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We learned that you can't have success

127
0:05:43.48,000 --> 0:05:44,000
without a little,

128
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or a lot, of failure.

129
0:05:47.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So in the future, don't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames,

130
0:05:51.08,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because you never know when your idea might just catch fire.

131
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Thank you.

132
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Applause)

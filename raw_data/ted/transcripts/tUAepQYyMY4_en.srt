1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The anger in me against corruption

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
made me to make a big career change

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My experiences over the last 18 months,

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
as a lawyer, has seeded in me

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a new entrepreneurial idea,

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which I believe is indeed

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
worth spreading.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, I share it with all of you here today,

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
though the idea itself is getting crystallized

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I'm still writing up the business plan.

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Of course it helps that fear of public failure

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
diminishes as the number of ideas

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which have failed increases.

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
since 1993.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I've explored, experienced,

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and experimented enterprise

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and capitalism to my heart's content.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I built, along with my two brothers,

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and then worked professionally

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with two of India's biggest businessmen,

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but in their startup enterprises.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to work on so-called social sector issues,

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I definitely did not have any grand strategy

28
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or plan to pursue and find

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for-profit solutions

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to addressing pressing public issues.

31
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
When life brought about a series

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of death and near-death experiences

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
within my close circle,

34
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which highlighted the need

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for an emergency medical response service in India,

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
similar to 911 in USA.

37
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
To address this, I, along with four friends,

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
founded Ambulance Access for All,

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to promote life-support ambulance services in India.

40
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
For those from the developing world,

41
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But as we envisioned it,

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we had three key goals:

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Providing world-class life support ambulance service

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,

46
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and universally accessible

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to anyone in a medical emergency,

48
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
irrespective of the capability to pay.

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The service which grew out of this,

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Dial 1298 for Ambulance,

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with one ambulance in 2004,

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,

53
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and has transported over 100,000 patients

54
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and victims since inception.

55
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The service is -- (Applause)

56
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
without accessing any public funds,

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the cross-subsidy model actually works,

59
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,

60
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The service responded effectively

62
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and efficiently,

63
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
during the unfortunate

64
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

65
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And as you can see from the visuals,

66
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the service was responding and rescuing

67
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
victims from the incident locations

68
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
even before the police could cordon off

69
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the incident locations

70
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and formally confirm it as a terror strike.

71
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We ended up being the first medical response team

72
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in every incident location

73
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and transported 125 victims,

74
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
saving life.

75
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Applause)

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In tribute and remembrance

77
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of 26/11 attacks

78
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
over the last one year,

79
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,

80
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Aman Foundation,

81
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service

82
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.

83
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's a small message from us,

85
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in our own small way

86
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to the enemies of humanity,

87
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of Islam, of South Asia,

88
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of India, and of Pakistan,

89
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that humanity will continue to bloom,

90
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
irrespective of such dastardly attacks.

91
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.

92
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
One is Education Access for All,

93
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
setting up schools in small-town India.

94
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,

95
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which is integrating rural supply chain

96
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.

97
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.

98
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Because diligent investors and venture funds

99
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.

100
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
With the significance being these funds have come in

101
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.

102
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise

103
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that I'm exploring.

104
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.

105
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You may be surprised to know

106
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that eight speakers yesterday

107
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
actually mentioned these terms in their talks.

108
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,

109
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with the supply side being mostly of

110
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
greedy corporate unethical businesses

111
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and hapless common man.

112
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And the demand side being mostly politicians,

113
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power

114
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
vested with them.

115
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
According to World Bank estimate,

116
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
one trillion dollars is paid in bribes

117
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
every year, worsening the condition

118
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of the already worse off.

119
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Yet, if you analyze the common man,

120
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
he or she does not wake up every day and say,

121
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."

122
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."

123
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation

124
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in

125
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that leads him to pay a bribe.

126
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In the modern day world, where time is premium

127
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,

128
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the hapless common man

129
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.

130
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now, let me ask you another question.

131
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe

132
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in your day-to-day life to get something done.

133
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What do you do? Of course you can call the police.

134
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?

135
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.

136
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But you also don't have the time, resources,

137
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
expertise or wherewithal to fight this.

138
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Unfortunately, many of us in this room

139
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.

140
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Yet the market forces around the world

141
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,

142
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.

143
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Like a bribe buster service,

144
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,

145
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or www.stopbribes.org or

146
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
www.preventcorruption.org.

147
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Such a service simply do not exist.

148
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
One image that has haunted me

149
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
from my early business days

150
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed

151
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.

152
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
All she needed was permission to build three steps

153
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to her house, from ground level,

154
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.

155
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit

156
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for want of a bribe.

157
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Even though it pricked my conscience then,

158
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I could not, or rather I did not

159
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
tend to her or assist her,

160
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because I was busy building my real estate company.

161
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.

162
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis

163
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to address individual instances of demands

164
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
for bribes for common services or entitlement.

165
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands

166
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
using existing and legitimate tools

167
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
like the Right to Information Act,

168
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
video, audio, or peer pressure,

169
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we have successfully obtained whatever our clients

170
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.

171
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower

172
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
than the bribe demanded.

173
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases

174
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
can be consolidated in standard processes

175
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in a BPO kind of environment,

176
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and made available on web, call-center

177
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and franchise physical offices,

178
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.

179
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The target market is as tempting as it can get.

180
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,

181
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
being paid in bribes every year,

182
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or equal to India's GDP.

183
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And it is an absolutely virgin market.

184
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I propose to explore this idea further,

185
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to examine the potential of creating

186
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
a for-profit, fee-based BPO

187
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
kind of service to stop bribes

188
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and prevent corruption.

189
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I do realize that the fight for justice

190
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
against corruption is never easy.

191
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It never has been and it never will be.

192
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
In my last 18 months as a lawyer,

193
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
battling small- and large-scale corruption,

194
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.

195
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Through his charities

196
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I have had three police cases filed against me

197
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.

198
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The battle against corruption

199
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
exacts a toll on ourselves,

200
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
our families, our friends, and even our kids.

201
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on

202
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.

203
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
What gives us the courage?

204
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
As my close friend replied, when told

205
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
during the seeding days of the ambulance project

206
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that it is an impossible task

207
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,

208
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,

209
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
at least in our own minds.

210
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
For we are insane people,

211
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
trying to do an impossible task.

212
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.

213
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

214
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.

215
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.

216
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
CA: What's on your mind?

218
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --

219
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?

220
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.

221
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Somebody who had applied for the passport.

222
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The officer was just sitting on it

223
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.

224
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And he did not want to pay.

225
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So we actually used the Right to Information Act,

226
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,

227
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and pushed back the officers in this particular case.

228
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And in all these 42 cases,

229
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
when we kept pushing them back,

230
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
there was three kinds of reaction.

231
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
A set of people actually say,

232
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."

233
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Some people actually come back and say,

234
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."

235
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And he will push us back.

236
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So you take the next step, or use the next tool available

237
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in what we are putting together,

238
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and then he relents.

239
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.

240
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,

241
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
what fee would you have to charge,

242
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and can you actually make the business work?

243
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred

244
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
was less than 200 rupees.

245
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So, it actually works.

246
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.

247
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

248
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.

249
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.

250
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.

251
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I mean, this could be huge.

252
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.

253
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

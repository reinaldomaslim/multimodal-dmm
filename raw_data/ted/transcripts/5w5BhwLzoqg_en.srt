1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
With me here today

2
0:00:14.44,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I brought something beautiful.

3
0:00:16.92,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is a feather from one of the most beautiful birds we have in Kenya,

4
0:00:21.6,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the crested guinea fowl.

5
0:00:24.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But this feather is more than just that.

6
0:00:27.56,000 --> 0:00:29,000
If you've taken time when you are outdoors

7
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to look at the feathers around you,

8
0:00:31.76,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you'll have noticed

9
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that there is this huge variety of different sizes,

10
0:00:36.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
shapes and even colors.

11
0:00:39.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The feather is one of the most astonishing pieces of technology

12
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
invented by the natural world,

13
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and for centuries, this feather has helped birds to keep dry,

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to keep warm and even power flight.

15
0:00:56.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
Only one section of the tree of life can actually make a feather.

16
0:01:01.4,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Among all the world's animals,

17
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
birds are the only ones who can make something

18
0:01:05.56,000 --> 0:01:06,000
like what I'm holding today.

19
0:01:07.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I personally have given them a nickname,

20
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I like to call them the feathermakers.

21
0:01:14.36,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It is the major difference between birds and any other animals we have on earth,

22
0:01:19.84,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and if you can't make a feather, you cannot call yourself a bird.

23
0:01:23.48,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:28,000
For us humans, who are earthbound,

25
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:29,000
birds represent freedom.

26
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This feather has enabled birds to conquer gravity

27
0:01:34.68,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and take to the air in an extraordinary way.

28
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Don't you sometimes wish you could fly like a bird?

29
0:01:42.72,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Birds are my passion,

30
0:01:45.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I want to change the way each one of you thinks about them.

31
0:01:49.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The easiest reason I love them so much is because they are beautiful.

32
0:01:54.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There are 10,000 species in the world,

33
0:01:57.64,000 --> 0:02:,000
and each one of them is uniquely beautiful.

34
0:02:02.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Birds are amazing,

35
0:02:04.48,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and this talk is dedicated to all the birds of the world.

36
0:02:08.2,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:09.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:13.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Indeed, these birds have been part of our lives and cultures

39
0:02:18.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
all over the world for centuries,

40
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and every society has a story about birds.

41
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You probably have heard childhood stories of different birds

42
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and how they relate with man.

43
0:02:29.68,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I personally recently learned

44
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that our human ancestors would follow flocks of vultures

45
0:02:35.32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then they would help them

46
0:02:36.76,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to identify where carcasses have been dropped by large carnivores,

47
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and these humans will scavenge and eat part of that meat.

48
0:02:45.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Birds have been used as brands and labels all over the world.

49
0:02:49.48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You know the bald eagle?

50
0:02:50.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It was chosen as the national emblem for the US

51
0:02:53.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because of its majestic strength,

52
0:02:55.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
beautiful looks

53
0:02:57.04,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and even a long lifespan.

54
0:02:59.52,000 --> 0:03:,000
And just like us humans

55
0:03:01.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who have managed to live in virtually all habitats of this earth,

56
0:03:05.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
birds have also conquered the world.

57
0:03:09.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
From birds such as these beautiful penguins

58
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that live in the cold ice caps

59
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to even others like the larks,

60
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who live in the hottest deserts you can imagine.

61
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Indeed, these species have conquered this world.

62
0:03:23.32,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Birds also build houses like us.

63
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The real pros in housebuilding

64
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:3,000
are a group of birds we call the weaverbirds,

65
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and this name they were given

66
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because of the way in which they weave their nests.

67
0:03:35.72,000 --> 0:03:36,000
An interesting one:

68
0:03:37.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
birds also love and date just like us humans.

69
0:03:40.72,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In fact, you'll be surprised to know that males dress to impress the women,

70
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I'll show you how.

71
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So here we have a long-tailed widowbird,

72
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and this is how they would normally look.

73
0:03:53.04,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But when it comes to the breeding season,

74
0:03:55.48,000 --> 0:03:57,000
everything changes,

75
0:03:57.8,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and this is how he looks.

76
0:03:59.8,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Audience murmurs)

77
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Yeah?

78
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Birds also, multiple species of them,

79
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
do love to touch and cuddle just like humans.

80
0:04:10.6,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I know you're wondering about this one.

81
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yes, they kiss too,

82
0:04:15.36,000 --> 0:04:16,000
sometimes very deeply.

83
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:20.32,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Some have even learned to cheat on their spouses.

85
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:24,000
For example, the African jacana:

87
0:04:25.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the females will mate with multiple males

88
0:04:28.399,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and then she takes off to find other males to mate with

89
0:04:31.36,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and she leaves the male behind to take care of the chicks.

90
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:36.2,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Applause)

92
0:04:40.12,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And birds help us so much,

93
0:04:42.36,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they play very crucial roles in our ecosystems each day.

94
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Vultures clean up our environment

95
0:04:48.92,000 --> 0:04:51,000
by literally digesting disease-causing pathogens,

96
0:04:52.32,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they finish carcasses that would otherwise cost us lots of money

97
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to clear from the environment.

98
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A sizable flock of vultures is capable of bringing down a carcass

99
0:05:02.08,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the size of a zebra straight to the bone

100
0:05:04.4,000 --> 0:05:05,000
within just about 30 minutes.

101
0:05:07.24,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Owls help to rid the environments of rodents

102
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and this helps us a lot because it saves us money --

103
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we don't lose our crops --

104
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and secondly, we don't have to buy harmful chemicals

105
0:05:18.04,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to handle these rodents.

106
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The beautiful sunbirds we see in our environments

107
0:05:24.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are part of nature's pollination crew,

108
0:05:26.96,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and they help our plants to form fruits.

109
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Together with other pollinators like insects,

110
0:05:32.92,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they have actually helped us

111
0:05:34.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to get most of the food crops that we depend on for many years.

112
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Unfortunately, the story of birds is by far not perfect.

113
0:05:44.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They are faced by numerous challenges every day wherever they live.

114
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Top on the threats facing birds

115
0:05:50.88,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is habitat loss

116
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and reduced food availability.

117
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Birds are also hunted, especially migratory species

118
0:05:58.96,000 --> 0:06:,000
and ducks that congregate in water bodies.

119
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Poisoning is happening to flocks that like to stick together,

120
0:06:06.32,000 --> 0:06:08,000
especially in places like rice schemes.

121
0:06:09.72,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Moreover, power lines are electrocuting birds

122
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and wind farms are slicing birds

123
0:06:15.56,000 --> 0:06:16,000
when they fly through the blades.

124
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Recently, we've heard the talk of climate change

125
0:06:21.36,000 --> 0:06:22,000
making a lot of headlines,

126
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it's also affecting birds,

127
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because birds are being forced to migrate to better breeding and feeding grounds

128
0:06:29.64,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because unfortunately where they used to live

129
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is no longer habitable.

130
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
My own perspective towards birds was changed

131
0:06:36.52,000 --> 0:06:38,000
when I was a small boy in high school,

132
0:06:38.72,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and there was this boy who struck,

133
0:06:40.4,000 --> 0:06:43,000
injuring the wing and the leg of a bird we called the augur buzzard.

134
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I was standing there,

135
0:06:46.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
just a mere 14-year-old,

136
0:06:48.36,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I imagined a human being in a similar situation,

137
0:06:51.92,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because this bird could not help itself.

138
0:06:54.48,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So even if I was hardly any biologist by then,

139
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I gathered with three of my friends and we decided to house the bird

140
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
until it had regained strength and then let it free.

141
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Interestingly, it accepted to feed on beef from our school kitchen,

142
0:07:10.04,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we hunted termites around the compound for its dinner every day.

143
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
After a few days, it had regained strength

144
0:07:16.4,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we released it.

145
0:07:17.68,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We were so happy to see it flap its wings

146
0:07:20.24,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and fly off gracefully.

147
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And that experience changed the way we looked at birds.

148
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We went on to actually make a magazine,

149
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and we called it the Hawk Magazine,

150
0:07:31.88,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this was in honor of this bird

151
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that we had helped within our own high school.

152
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Those experiences in high school made me the conservationist I am today.

153
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And a passion for birds should especially matter for Africa

154
0:07:46.8,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and all Africans,

155
0:07:48.28,000 --> 0:07:5,000
because among all other continents,

156
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Africa hosts some of the most amazing bird species

157
0:07:53.56,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you can find anywhere in the world.

158
0:07:55.84,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Imagine having a name like "shoebill."

159
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That's the name of that bird.

160
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And there are countries like DR Congo,

161
0:08:04.28,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya

162
0:08:06.84,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who are leading the continent in highest numbers of diversity

163
0:08:10.4,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when it comes to the species.

164
0:08:13.04,000 --> 0:08:15,000
These birds continue to provide the continent

165
0:08:15.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with very crucial ecosystem services that Africa needs.

166
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Moreover, there is huge potential

167
0:08:22.88,000 --> 0:08:25,000
for Africa to lead the world in avian tourism.

168
0:08:27.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The economy will definitely benefit.

169
0:08:30.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Imagine how many communities will benefit from groups of tourists

170
0:08:34.44,000 --> 0:08:37,000
visiting their villages just to see the endemic birds

171
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that can only be found in those villages.

172
0:08:41.32,000 --> 0:08:42,000
How can we help birds together?

173
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
There is now a chance for all of you

174
0:08:46.96,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to turn your passion for birds

175
0:08:48.799,000 --> 0:08:5,000
into contributing to their continued survival,

176
0:08:51.72,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and you can do that by becoming a citizen scientist.

177
0:08:56.52,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Citizen science is a growing trend around the world,

178
0:09:00.24,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we are having scenarios where people are sharing information

179
0:09:03.32,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with the rest of the community about traffic updates,

180
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:08,000
security alerts and so on.

181
0:09:08.6,000 --> 0:09:11,000
That is exactly what we realized as bird-watchers,

182
0:09:12.4,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we thought, because birds are found everywhere,

183
0:09:15.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
if we've got all of you and everyone else in Africa

184
0:09:18.68,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to tell us the birds they find where they live,

185
0:09:21.08,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where they school, or even where they work,

186
0:09:23.52,000 --> 0:09:27,000
then we can be able to come up with a map of every single species,

187
0:09:28.08,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and from there scientists will be able

188
0:09:30.84,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to actually prioritize conservation efforts

189
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to those habitats that matter the most.

190
0:09:36.4,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Take for example these two projects,

191
0:09:38.48,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the Africa Raptor DataBank,

192
0:09:40.28,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is mapping all birds of prey in the continent of Africa,

193
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and the Kenya Bird Map,

194
0:09:45.48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which is mapping about 1,100 species that occur in my country, Kenya.

195
0:09:50.44,000 --> 0:09:52,000
These two projects now have online databases

196
0:09:53.44,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that are allowing people to submit data,

197
0:09:55.92,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and this is converted into very interactive websites

198
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that the public can consume and make decisions from.

199
0:10:02.68,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But when we started, there was a big challenge.

200
0:10:04.96,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We received many complaints from bird-watchers,

201
0:10:07.44,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and they will say,

202
0:10:08.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"I'm in a village, and I cannot access a computer.

203
0:10:11.08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
How do I tell you what birds live in my home,

204
0:10:13.72,000 --> 0:10:15,000
or where I school, or where I work?"

205
0:10:16.12,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So we were forced to renovate our strategy and come up with a sustainable solution.

206
0:10:21.84,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It was easy:

207
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we immediately realized that mobile phones

208
0:10:25.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
were becoming increasingly common in Africa

209
0:10:28.08,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and most of the regions could get access to one.

210
0:10:31.52,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So we came up with mobile phone applications

211
0:10:35.24,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that you can use on your iPhone and on your Android phone,

212
0:10:38.4,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and we made them freely available

213
0:10:40.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
for every bird-watching enthusiast out there.

214
0:10:44.8,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So we came up with BirdLasser, which is used by the Kenya Bird Map,

215
0:10:49.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and also we have the African Raptor Observations,

216
0:10:52.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which is now used by the African Raptor DataBank.

217
0:10:55.88,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This was a huge breakthrough in our work

218
0:10:58.04,000 --> 0:11:,000
and it made us get enormous amounts of data

219
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:02,000
from every birder out there in the regions.

220
0:11:04.4,000 --> 0:11:06,000
With this, we realized that citizen science

221
0:11:06.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is indeed very powerful,

222
0:11:08.88,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the reason being, citizen science is adaptive.

223
0:11:12.92,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And we were able to actually convert many bird-watchers

224
0:11:16.4,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to start sharing new information with us.

225
0:11:22.24,000 --> 0:11:23,000
When we were starting,

226
0:11:23.48,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we didn't know that birds could be a huge gateway

227
0:11:26.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to approaching conservation of other forms of animals.

228
0:11:29.6,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Interestingly, now in the Virtual Museum for Africa,

229
0:11:32.88,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we have maps for dragonflies and damselflies,

230
0:11:36.08,000 --> 0:11:37,000
butterflies and moths,

231
0:11:37.84,000 --> 0:11:41,000
reptiles, frogs, orchids, spiders,

232
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
scorpions, and yes, we are even mapping mushrooms.

233
0:11:45.88,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Who could have imagined mapping mushrooms?

234
0:11:48.56,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So this showed us that indeed we've created a community of people

235
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
who care about nature in Africa.

236
0:11:56.72,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I hereby call upon all of you

237
0:11:58.96,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to join me in promoting the value of birds

238
0:12:02.2,000 --> 0:12:03,000
within your communities.

239
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Please just tell your friends about birds,

240
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:1,000
for we are always inclined to love and care for that which we know.

241
0:12:11.72,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Please spend a few minutes in your free time

242
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
when you are at work, at school, or maybe at home,

243
0:12:17.12,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to at least look around you and see which beautiful birds are there.

244
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Come join us in citizen science

245
0:12:22.84,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and tell us the birds you're finding in the places where you visit.

246
0:12:26.84,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Even simpler,

247
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you could buy your child or your sibling

248
0:12:30.8,000 --> 0:12:31,000
a pair of binoculars

249
0:12:32.64,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or a bird book

250
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and let them just appreciate how beautiful these birds are.

251
0:12:37.52,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Because maybe one day they will want to care

252
0:12:40.4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for that one which they know and love.

253
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The children indeed are our future.

254
0:12:46.12,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Let us please teach them to love our feathermakers,

255
0:12:49.64,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because the love of birds

256
0:12:51.6,000 --> 0:12:55,000
can be a huge gateway to appreciating all forms of nature.

257
0:12:55.96,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Thank you very much.

258
0:12:57.2,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

259
0:13:02.48,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you.

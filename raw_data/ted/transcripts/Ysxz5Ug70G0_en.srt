1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a daughter, Mulan.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And when she was eight, last year,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
she was doing a report for school

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or she had some homework about frogs.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And we were at this restaurant,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and she said, "So, basically,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
frogs lay eggs

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and tadpoles turn into frogs."

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and then the males fertilize them.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I said, "Yeah."

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient,

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
you know, that you need

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to create a new frog

20
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter)

21
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?"

22
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I thought, "Okay, here we go."

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and all I could remember was,

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"Only answer the question they're asking.

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Don't give any more information." (Laughter)

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So I said, "Yes."

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And she said, "And where do, um,

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
where do human women,

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
like, where do women lay their eggs?"

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I said, "Well,

33
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
funny you should ask. (Laughter)

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We have evolved to have our own pond.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And we lay our eggs there,

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I said, "Well,

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Men, through their penis,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And you go through the woman's vagina."

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and she goes, "Mom!

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Like, where you go to the bathroom?"

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I said, "I know.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I know."

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
right next to an amusement park ...

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Bad zoning, but ..." (Laughter)

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom,

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So how could that ever happen?"

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Human males and females

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
develop a special bond,

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and when they're much older, much, much older than you,

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they have a very special feeling,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
then they can be naked together."

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And she said, "Mom,

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
have you done this before?"

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I said, "Yes."

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I said, "Yes."

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again."

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I said, "..."

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Like, how do they know that's the time?

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Mom, does the man just say,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I said, "Yes."

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"That is exactly right.

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That's exactly how it happens."

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Oh ..."

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Would that ever happen?"

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I said, "Oh, no, no.

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's not how we do it."

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Mom, how do cats do it?"

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I don't understand the legs."

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I go, "I know, but the legs ..."

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it."

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet,

101
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And we watched them and I'm so thankful,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She goes, "What about dogs?"

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So we put in dogs mating, and,

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.

109
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then she goes, "Mom,

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
do you think they would have, on the Internet,

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
any humans mating?"

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And then I realized that

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I had taken my little eight year old's hand,

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I looked into this

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
trusting, loving face,

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I said,

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"Oh, no.

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That would never happen."

121
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Thank you.

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Applause)

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Thank you.

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Applause)

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.

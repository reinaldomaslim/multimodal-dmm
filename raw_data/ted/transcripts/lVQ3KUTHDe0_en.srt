1
0:00:13.11,000 --> 0:00:17,000
They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession,

2
0:00:17.77,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that I should be fired,

3
0:00:19.322,000 --> 0:00:21,000
have my medical license taken away,

4
0:00:21.961,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I should go back to my own country.

5
0:00:26.375,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My email got hacked.

6
0:00:28.018,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In a discussion forum for other doctors,

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
someone took credit for "Twitter-bombing" my account.

8
0:00:35.521,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now, I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing,

9
0:00:38.044,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but then came the response:

10
0:00:40.331,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."

11
0:00:44.569,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I never thought that I would do something

12
0:00:46.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors.

13
0:00:50.369,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Becoming a doctor was my dream.

14
0:00:52.574,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I grew up in China,

15
0:00:53.875,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital

16
0:00:57.243,000 --> 0:01:,000
because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week.

17
0:01:01.441,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam, who always took care of me.

18
0:01:04.517,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She was about the same age as my mother.

19
0:01:06.556,000 --> 0:01:08,000
She had this wild, curly hair,

20
0:01:08.626,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses.

21
0:01:12.027,000 --> 0:01:13,000
She was one of those doctors who,

22
0:01:13.991,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if you fell and you broke your arm,

23
0:01:16.11,000 --> 0:01:18,000
she would ask you why you weren't laughing

24
0:01:18.427,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because it's your humerus. Get it?

25
0:01:22.312,000 --> 0:01:23,000
See, you'd groan,

26
0:01:24.054,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her.

27
0:01:27.546,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, we all have that childhood hero

28
0:01:29.556,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that we want to grow up to be just like, right?

29
0:01:32.188,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.

30
0:01:35.634,000 --> 0:01:38,000
When I was eight, my parents and I moved to the U.S.,

31
0:01:39.404,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and ours became the typical immigrant narrative.

32
0:01:41.668,000 --> 0:01:45,000
My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas

33
0:01:46.186,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so that I could pursue my dream.

34
0:01:49.213,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Well, eventually I learned enough English,

35
0:01:51.495,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and my parents were so happy

36
0:01:53.026,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service.

37
0:01:58.35,000 --> 0:02:,000
But then one day, everything changed.

38
0:02:01.495,000 --> 0:02:03,000
My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well,

39
0:02:04.305,000 --> 0:02:07,000
she had a cough that wouldn't go away, she was short of breath and tired.

40
0:02:07.836,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Well, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything.

41
0:02:11.467,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For her to tell me that something was the matter,

42
0:02:14.038,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I knew something had to be really wrong.

43
0:02:16.359,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And it was:

44
0:02:17.678,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer,

45
0:02:20.835,000 --> 0:02:23,000
cancer that by then had spread to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.

46
0:02:26.05,000 --> 0:02:28,000
My mother was brave, though, and she had hope.

47
0:02:28.214,000 --> 0:02:29,000
She went through surgery and radiation,

48
0:02:30.195,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and was on her third round of chemotherapy

49
0:02:32.574,000 --> 0:02:34,000
when she lost her address book.

50
0:02:34.761,000 --> 0:02:37,000
She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet

51
0:02:37.86,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and she found it, but she found something else too.

52
0:02:40.433,000 --> 0:02:41,000
On several websites,

53
0:02:41.938,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company,

54
0:02:45.493,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and in fact often spoke on behalf

55
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her.

56
0:02:50.973,000 --> 0:02:51,000
She called me in a panic,

57
0:02:52.57,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I didn't know what to believe.

58
0:02:54.288,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her,

59
0:02:56.541,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but maybe it wasn't.

60
0:02:58.822,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It made her scared and it made her doubt.

61
0:03:01.972,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When it comes to medicine,

62
0:03:03.682,000 --> 0:03:05,000
having that trust is a must,

63
0:03:06.292,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and when that trust is gone, then all that's left is fear.

64
0:03:11.75,000 --> 0:03:13,000
There's another side to this fear.

65
0:03:13.817,000 --> 0:03:16,000
As a medical student, I was taking care of this 19-year-old

66
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:18,000
who was biking back to his dorm

67
0:03:18.499,000 --> 0:03:2,000
when he got struck and hit,

68
0:03:20.638,000 --> 0:03:22,000
run over by an SUV.

69
0:03:23.166,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He had seven broken ribs,

70
0:03:24.852,000 --> 0:03:25,000
shattered hip bones,

71
0:03:26.225,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain.

72
0:03:29.424,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now, imagine being his parents

73
0:03:31.208,000 --> 0:03:33,000
who flew in from Seattle, 2,000 miles away,

74
0:03:33.368,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to find their son in a coma.

75
0:03:35.764,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right?

76
0:03:38.771,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They asked to attend our bedside rounds

77
0:03:40.689,000 --> 0:03:42,000
where we discussed his condition and his plan,

78
0:03:42.891,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which I thought was a reasonable request,

79
0:03:44.888,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and also would give us a chance to show them

80
0:03:46.938,000 --> 0:03:48,000
how much we were trying and how much we cared.

81
0:03:49.389,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The head doctor, though, said no.

82
0:03:52.29,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He gave all kinds of reasons.

83
0:03:53.932,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.

84
0:03:55.814,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions.

85
0:03:59.95,000 --> 0:04:,000
He even said,

86
0:04:01.387,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"

87
0:04:05.595,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear,

88
0:04:08.777,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and what I learned was that to become a doctor,

89
0:04:11.499,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we have to put on our white coats,

90
0:04:13.34,000 --> 0:04:15,000
put up a wall, and hide behind it.

91
0:04:17.459,000 --> 0:04:19,000
There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.

92
0:04:20.367,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Of course, patients are scared when they come to the doctor.

93
0:04:23.182,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache,

94
0:04:25.556,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you go to the hospital,

95
0:04:26.742,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you're lying in this strange place, you're on this hospital gurney,

96
0:04:29.994,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you're wearing this flimsy gown,

97
0:04:31.55,000 --> 0:04:33,000
strangers are coming to poke and prod at you.

98
0:04:33.709,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You don't know what's going to happen.

99
0:04:35.554,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.

100
0:04:39.532,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But it's not just patients who are scared;

101
0:04:41.793,000 --> 0:04:42,000
doctors are scared too.

102
0:04:43.66,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We're scared of patients finding out who we are

103
0:04:46.526,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and what medicine is all about.

104
0:04:48.656,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And so what do we do?

105
0:04:50.247,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We put on our white coats and we hide behind them.

106
0:04:53.253,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Of course, the more we hide,

107
0:04:54.962,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding.

108
0:04:57.761,000 --> 0:05:,000
The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care.

109
0:05:01.213,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We don't just have a fear of sickness,

110
0:05:03.489,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we have a sickness of fear.

111
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Can we bridge this disconnect

112
0:05:09.316,000 --> 0:05:12,000
between what patients need and what doctors do?

113
0:05:13.135,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Can we overcome the sickness of fear?

114
0:05:15.913,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Let me ask you differently:

115
0:05:17.28,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If hiding isn't the answer, what if we did the opposite?

116
0:05:21.103,000 --> 0:05:25,000
What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients?

117
0:05:26.531,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Last fall, I conducted a research study to find out

118
0:05:29.272,000 --> 0:05:31,000
what it is that people want to know about their healthcare.

119
0:05:32.128,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital,

120
0:05:34.514,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but everyday people.

121
0:05:35.965,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So my two medical students, Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,

122
0:05:39.137,000 --> 0:05:41,000
literally took their research to the streets.

123
0:05:41.532,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They went to banks, coffee shops, senior centers,

124
0:05:45.271,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Chinese restaurants and train stations.

125
0:05:49.191,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What did they find?

126
0:05:50.593,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Well, when we asked people,

127
0:05:51.962,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"What do you want to know about your healthcare?"

128
0:05:54.388,000 --> 0:05:57,000
people responded with what they want to know about their doctors,

129
0:05:58.086,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because people understand health care

130
0:05:59.883,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors.

131
0:06:03.864,000 --> 0:06:05,000
When we asked, "What do you want to know about your doctors?"

132
0:06:06.787,000 --> 0:06:07,000
people gave three different answers.

133
0:06:08.515,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Some want to know that their doctor is competent

134
0:06:11.308,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and certified to practice medicine.

135
0:06:13.614,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased

136
0:06:16.02,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and is making decisions based on evidence and science,

137
0:06:19.418,000 --> 0:06:2,000
not on who pays them.

138
0:06:21.544,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Surprisingly to us,

139
0:06:23.104,000 --> 0:06:26,000
many people want to know something else about their doctors.

140
0:06:26.618,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,

141
0:06:29.25,000 --> 0:06:33,000
says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients

142
0:06:34.026,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and specializes in LGBT health.

143
0:06:36.659,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,

144
0:06:38.401,000 --> 0:06:41,000
says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values

145
0:06:41.726,000 --> 0:06:43,000
when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights.

146
0:06:45.634,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Frank, a 59-year-old hardware store owner,

147
0:06:47.815,000 --> 0:06:49,000
doesn't even like going to the doctor

148
0:06:50.155,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first,

149
0:06:53.699,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but who is comfortable with alternative treatments.

150
0:06:56.803,000 --> 0:06:58,000
One after another, our respondents told us

151
0:06:59.143,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one —

152
0:07:02.621,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that to show their doctors their bodies

153
0:07:04.587,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and tell them their deepest secrets,

154
0:07:06.555,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they want to first understand their doctor's values.

155
0:07:09.627,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Just because doctors have to see every patient

156
0:07:12.585,000 --> 0:07:14,000
doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor.

157
0:07:15.17,000 --> 0:07:17,000
People want to know about their doctors first

158
0:07:17.388,000 --> 0:07:18,000
so that they can make an informed choice.

159
0:07:20.792,000 --> 0:07:22,000
As a result of this, I formed a campaign,

160
0:07:22.968,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Who's My Doctor?

161
0:07:24.442,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that calls for total transparency in medicine.

162
0:07:27.302,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Participating doctors voluntarily disclose

163
0:07:29.534,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on a public website

164
0:07:30.927,000 --> 0:07:32,000
not just information about where we went to medical school

165
0:07:33.683,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and what specialty we're in,

166
0:07:35.029,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but also our conflicts of interest.

167
0:07:36.982,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act

168
0:07:39.446,000 --> 0:07:41,000
about drug company affiliations,

169
0:07:41.883,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and we talk about how we're paid.

170
0:07:44.887,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Incentives matter.

171
0:07:46.431,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If you go to your doctor because of back pain,

172
0:07:48.618,000 --> 0:07:51,000
you might want to know he's getting paid 5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery

173
0:07:52.447,000 --> 0:07:55,000
versus 25 dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist,

174
0:07:56.241,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends.

175
0:08:00.549,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Then, we go one step further.

176
0:08:03.247,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We add our values when it comes to women's health,

177
0:08:05.959,000 --> 0:08:07,000
LGBT health, alternative medicine,

178
0:08:08.18,000 --> 0:08:11,000
preventive health, and end-of-life decisions.

179
0:08:11.191,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you,

180
0:08:14.711,000 --> 0:08:16,000
so you have a right to know who we are.

181
0:08:17.456,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear.

182
0:08:21.555,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't,

183
0:08:24.266,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue.

184
0:08:29.48,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor?

185
0:08:31.719,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Medscape's public forum

186
0:08:33.23,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and several online doctors' communities

187
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
had thousands of posts about this topic.

188
0:08:39.021,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Here are a few.

189
0:08:40.288,000 --> 0:08:42,000
From a gastroenterologist in Portland:

190
0:08:42.548,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"I devoted 12 years of my life to being a slave.

191
0:08:45.76,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I have loans and mortgages.

192
0:08:47.707,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients."

193
0:08:51.985,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, times may be hard for everyone,

194
0:08:54.251,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but try telling your patient

195
0:08:55.972,000 --> 0:08:58,000
making 35,000 dollars a year to serve a family of four

196
0:08:58.986,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that you need the free lunch.

197
0:09:02.708,000 --> 0:09:04,000
From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:

198
0:09:05.041,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from.

199
0:09:09.639,000 --> 0:09:11,000
My patients don't disclose their incomes to me."

200
0:09:13.202,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health.

201
0:09:17.737,000 --> 0:09:19,000
From a psychiatrist in New York City:

202
0:09:19.932,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs,

203
0:09:23.351,000 --> 0:09:24,000
what model of car we drive,

204
0:09:24.982,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and what toilet paper we use."

205
0:09:27.434,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle

206
0:09:30.168,000 --> 0:09:32,000
won't affect your patients' health,

207
0:09:32.204,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but your views on a woman's right to choose

208
0:09:34.205,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and preventive medicine and end-of-life decisions just might.

209
0:09:38.501,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And my favorite, from a Kansas City cardiologist:

210
0:09:41.374,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"More government-mandated stuff?

211
0:09:44.456,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country."

212
0:09:48.535,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Well, two pieces of good news.

213
0:09:50.145,000 --> 0:09:53,000
First of all, this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory,

214
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and second of all, I'm American and I'm already here.

215
0:09:57.04,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

216
0:10:05.512,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Within a month, my employers were getting calls

217
0:10:08.241,000 --> 0:10:09,000
asking for me to be fired.

218
0:10:10.633,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I received mail at my undisclosed home address

219
0:10:13.806,000 --> 0:10:16,000
with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me.

220
0:10:17.3,000 --> 0:10:2,000
My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign.

221
0:10:21.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
After the bomb threat, I was done.

222
0:10:24.823,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But then I heard from patients.

223
0:10:26.765,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Over social media, a TweetChat,

224
0:10:29.449,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which I'd learned what that was by then,

225
0:10:31.377,000 --> 0:10:34,000
generated 4.3 million impressions,

226
0:10:34.867,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue.

227
0:10:38.772,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They wrote with things like,

228
0:10:40.404,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of,

229
0:10:43.53,000 --> 0:10:44,000
they shouldn't be doing it."

230
0:10:46.121,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions.

231
0:10:49.175,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests.

232
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Why shouldn't doctors?"

233
0:10:53.782,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And finally, many people wrote and said,

234
0:10:56.51,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Let us patients decide

235
0:10:58.678,000 --> 0:11:,000
what's important when we're choosing a doctor."

236
0:11:02.439,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In our initial trial,

237
0:11:03.833,000 --> 0:11:06,000
over 300 doctors have taken the total transparency pledge.

238
0:11:08.289,000 --> 0:11:1,000
What a crazy new idea, right?

239
0:11:10.841,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But actually, this is not that new of a concept at all.

240
0:11:13.822,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,

241
0:11:15.614,000 --> 0:11:17,000
with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?

242
0:11:18.413,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Well, she was my doctor,

243
0:11:19.953,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but she was also our neighbor

244
0:11:21.499,000 --> 0:11:23,000
who lived in the building across the street.

245
0:11:23.681,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I went to the same school as her daughter.

246
0:11:26.007,000 --> 0:11:28,000
My parents and I trusted her

247
0:11:28.267,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because we knew who she was and what she stood for,

248
0:11:30.663,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and she had no need to hide from us.

249
0:11:33.551,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Just one generation ago, this was the norm in the U.S. as well.

250
0:11:37.221,000 --> 0:11:4,000
You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys,

251
0:11:40.697,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that he quit smoking a few years ago,

252
0:11:42.542,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that he says he's a regular churchgoer,

253
0:11:44.533,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but you see him twice a year: once at Easter

254
0:11:46.85,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and once when his mother-in-law comes to town.

255
0:11:50.492,000 --> 0:11:51,000
You knew what he was about,

256
0:11:51.849,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and he had no need to hide from you.

257
0:11:54.837,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But the sickness of fear has taken over,

258
0:11:57.168,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and patients suffer the consequences.

259
0:11:59.859,000 --> 0:12:,000
I know this firsthand.

260
0:12:02.13,000 --> 0:12:04,000
My mother fought her cancer for eight years.

261
0:12:05.07,000 --> 0:12:06,000
She was a planner,

262
0:12:06.238,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live

263
0:12:08.623,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and how she wanted to die.

264
0:12:10.53,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Not only did she sign advance directives,

265
0:12:13.101,000 --> 0:12:16,000
she wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough,

266
0:12:16.951,000 --> 0:12:17,000
how it was time for her to go.

267
0:12:19.867,000 --> 0:12:21,000
One day, when I was a resident physician,

268
0:12:21.901,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit.

269
0:12:25.92,000 --> 0:12:28,000
By the time I got there, she was about to be intubated

270
0:12:29.36,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and put on a breathing machine.

271
0:12:31.905,000 --> 0:12:34,000
"But this is not what she wants," I said, "and we have documents."

272
0:12:36.145,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,

273
0:12:38.891,000 --> 0:12:42,000
pointed at my then 16-year-old sister, and said,

274
0:12:43.043,000 --> 0:12:45,000
"Do you remember when you were that age?

275
0:12:45.201,000 --> 0:12:47,000
How would you have liked to grow up without your mother?"

276
0:12:49.568,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Her oncologist was there too, and said,

277
0:12:52.238,000 --> 0:12:53,000
"This is your mother.

278
0:12:54.177,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life

279
0:12:56.83,000 --> 0:12:57,000
if you don't do everything for her?"

280
0:13:00.375,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I knew my mother so well.

281
0:13:02.435,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I understood what her directives meant so well,

282
0:13:05.595,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but I was a physician.

283
0:13:09.413,000 --> 0:13:13,000
That was the single hardest decision I ever made,

284
0:13:13.884,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to let her die in peace,

285
0:13:16.933,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and I carry those words of those doctors with me

286
0:13:19.633,000 --> 0:13:2,000
every single day.

287
0:13:23.142,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We can bridge the disconnect

288
0:13:25.356,000 --> 0:13:28,000
between what doctors do and what patients need.

289
0:13:30.157,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We can get there, because we've been there before,

290
0:13:32.838,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and we know that transparency gets us to that trust.

291
0:13:35.331,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors,

292
0:13:38.096,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that having open medical records,

293
0:13:39.702,000 --> 0:13:41,000
being willing to talk about medical errors,

294
0:13:41.739,000 --> 0:13:42,000
will increase patient trust,

295
0:13:43.429,000 --> 0:13:44,000
improve health outcomes,

296
0:13:45.15,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and reduce malpractice.

297
0:13:47.21,000 --> 0:13:48,000
That openness, that trust,

298
0:13:48.749,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is only going to be more important

299
0:13:50.423,000 --> 0:13:53,000
as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease.

300
0:13:54.013,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy,

301
0:13:57.487,000 --> 0:14:,000
but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices,

302
0:14:01.43,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to address issues like smoking cessation,

303
0:14:03.728,000 --> 0:14:06,000
blood-pressure management and diabetes control,

304
0:14:06.765,000 --> 0:14:08,000
well, that requires us to establish trust.

305
0:14:11.003,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Here's what other transparent doctors have said.

306
0:14:13.873,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:

307
0:14:16.79,000 --> 0:14:19,000
"This has brought me closer to my patients.

308
0:14:19.803,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The type of relationship I've developed —

309
0:14:22.547,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that's why I entered medicine."

310
0:14:26.117,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:

311
0:14:28.79,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"I tell my patients that I am totally open with them.

312
0:14:32.286,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I don't hide anything from them.

313
0:14:34.36,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This is me. Now tell me about you.

314
0:14:37.286,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We're in this together."

315
0:14:39.518,000 --> 0:14:41,000
May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:

316
0:14:41.92,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing.

317
0:14:45.998,000 --> 0:14:47,000
They ask me how I could be so brave.

318
0:14:48.584,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I said, I'm not being brave,

319
0:14:51.552,000 --> 0:14:52,000
it's my job."

320
0:14:55.024,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I leave you today with a final thought.

321
0:14:58.428,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Being totally transparent is scary.

322
0:15:01.772,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,

323
0:15:05.102,000 --> 0:15:08,000
but that vulnerability, that humility,

324
0:15:08.74,000 --> 0:15:12,000
it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine.

325
0:15:13.256,000 --> 0:15:15,000
When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals,

326
0:15:15.664,000 --> 0:15:16,000
take off our white coats,

327
0:15:17.14,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about,

328
0:15:20.521,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear.

329
0:15:23.786,000 --> 0:15:24,000
That's when we establish trust.

330
0:15:25.715,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That's when we change the paradigm of medicine

331
0:15:28.175,000 --> 0:15:29,000
from one of secrecy and hiding

332
0:15:29.985,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to one that is fully open and engaged

333
0:15:32.344,000 --> 0:15:33,000
for our patients.

334
0:15:35.027,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

335
0:15:36.924,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Applause)

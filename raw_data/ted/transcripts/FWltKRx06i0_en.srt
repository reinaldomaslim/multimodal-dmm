0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,

2
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I've very rarely played

3
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
any new songs of my own.

4
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that was largely because there weren't any.

5
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So I've been busy with a couple of projects,

7
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and one of them was this:

8
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The Nutmeg.

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which I've been restoring in the garden

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
of my beach house in England.

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And, so now,

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when the polar ice caps melt,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I'll float off into the drowned world

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
During the day,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the Nutmeg collects energy

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and from a 450 watt turbine

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
up the mast.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So that when it gets dark,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I've got plenty of power.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I work on new songs.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'd like to play to you guys,

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's about Billie Holiday.

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And it appears that,

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
some night in 1947

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
she left her physical space

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and was missing all night,

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
until she reappeared in the morning.

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But I know where she was.

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
She was with me on my lifeboat.

38
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And she was hot.

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Music)

40
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000

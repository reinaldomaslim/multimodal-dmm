1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let's start with day and night.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Life evolved under conditions

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of light and darkness,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
light and then darkness.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And so plants and animals

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
developed their own internal clocks

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
so that they would be ready for these changes in light.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
These are chemical clocks,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and in some that only have one cell.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'll give you an example --

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and you fly it all the way across the continent,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and you drop it into a sloped cage,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it will scramble up the floor of the cage

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
as the tide is rising

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on its home shores,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
thousands of miles away.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It'll do this for weeks,

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
until it kind of gradually loses the plot.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And it's incredible to watch,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So, we have this ability as well.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for a couple of months. (Laughter)

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
People actually volunteer for this,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and they usually come out

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they all show the same thing.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so --

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
over the course of the weeks.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
rather than somehow sensing the day outside.

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So fine, we have a body clock,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's a huge driver for culture

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We evolved as a species near the equator,

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and so we're very well-equipped

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to deal with 12 hours of daylight

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and 12 hours of darkness.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and in Arctic Canada, where I live,

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we have perpetual daylight in summer

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and 24 hours of darkness in winter.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
traditionally has been highly seasonal.

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you enjoy your family life inside.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and working activity very long hours,

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
very active.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What would our sleeping patterns be

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the sort of ideal sense?

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Well, it turns out

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that when people are living

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
without any sort of artificial light at all,

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they sleep twice every night.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
until midnight

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and then again, they sleep

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And in-between, they have a couple of hours

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of sort of meditative quiet in bed.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And during this time,

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
there's a surge of prolactin,

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the likes of which a modern day never sees.

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The people in these studies

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
report feeling so awake during the daytime,

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that they realize

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they're experiencing true wakefulness

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for the first time in their lives.

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So, cut to the modern day.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We're living in a culture of jet lag,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
global travel,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
24-hour business,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
shift work.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And you know, our modern ways

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of doing things

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
have their advantages,

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but I believe we should understand the costs.

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Thank you.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But we do not know his face.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Thousands of books have been written about him,

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, what do you think?

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Let's find out.

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
But no faces?

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I find that hard to believe.

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --

17
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
en face or three-quarters.

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo

19
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
must have made self-portraits from time to time.

20
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So let's try to find them.

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I think that if we were to scan all of his work

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.

23
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,

24
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and looked for male portraits.

25
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
There are about 120, you see them here.

26
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?

27
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.

28
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So we can eliminate all the profiles.

29
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.

30
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.

31
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And we know from his contemporaries

32
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.

33
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.

34
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.

36
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And here they are.

37
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Yes, indeed, the old man is there,

38
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.

39
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."

40
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Before we go into these faces,

41
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.

42
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself

43
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.

44
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.

46
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.

47
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.

48
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,

49
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,

50
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.

51
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.

52
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.

53
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,

54
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and look, they are very similar.

55
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, are they made in the right order?

56
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The young man should be made first.

57
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And as you see here from the years that they were created,

58
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it is indeed the case.

59
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They are made in the right order.

60
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?

61
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.

62
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person

63
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of the same age as Leonardo at the time.

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?

65
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, we need a reference.

66
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.

67
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,

68
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.

69
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And if we now compare the face of the statue,

70
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.

71
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo

72
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to those three faces.

73
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.

74
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.

75
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The icon of icons finally has a face.

76
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.

77
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What I want to talk to you about

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is what we can learn from studying the genomes

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of living people

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and extinct humans.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But before doing that,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that our genomes, our genetic material,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the form of DNA,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
which is this famous double-helical molecule.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the genetic information

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is contained in the form of a sequence

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of four bases

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And the information is there twice --

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
one on each strand --

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which is important,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because when new cells are formed, these strands come apart,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in an almost perfect process.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But nothing, of course, in nature

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is totally perfect,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so sometimes an error is made

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and a wrong letter is built in.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And we can then see the result

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of such mutations

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
when we compare DNA sequences

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
among us here in the room, for example.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
If we compare my genome to the genome of you,

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
approximately every 1,200, 1,300 letters

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
will differ between us.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And these mutations accumulate

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
approximately as a function of time.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So if we add in a chimpanzee here, we will see more differences.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Approximately one letter in a hundred

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
will differ from a chimpanzee.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And if you're then interested in the history

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of a piece of DNA, or the whole genome,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you can reconstruct the history of the DNA

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
with those differences you observe.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And generally we depict our ideas about this history

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the form of trees like this.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In this case, it's very simple.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The two human DNA sequences

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
go back to a common ancestor quite recently.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And because these mutations

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
happen approximately as a function of time,

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you can transform these differences

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to estimates of time,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
where the two humans, typically,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago,

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and with the chimpanzees,

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it will be in the order of five million years ago.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So what has now happened in the last few years

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is that there are account technologies around

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So we can now, in a matter of hours,

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
determine a whole human genome.

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Each of us, of course, contains two human genomes --

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
one from our mothers and one from our fathers.

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And they are around three billion such letters long.

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And we will find that the two genomes in me,

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or one genome of mine we want to use,

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
will have about three million differences

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the order of that.

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And what you can then also begin to do

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is to say, "How are these genetic differences

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
distributed across the world?"

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And if you do that,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And if you look outside Africa,

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you actually find less genetic variation.

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is surprising, of course,

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because in the order of six to eight times fewer people

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
live in Africa than outside Africa.

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Yet the people inside Africa

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
have more genetic variation.

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Moreover, almost all these genetic variants

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we see outside Africa

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
have closely related DNA sequences

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that you find inside Africa.

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But if you look in Africa,

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
there is a component of the genetic variation

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that has no close relatives outside.

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So a model to explain this

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that a part of the African variation, but not all of it,

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
[has] gone out and colonized the rest of the world.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And together with the methods to date these genetic differences,

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
this has led to the insight

91
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that modern humans --

92
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me --

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
evolved in Africa, quite recently,

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
between 100 and 200,000 years ago.

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so,

96
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
went out of Africa

97
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to colonize the rest of the world.

98
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So what I often like to say

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is that, from a genomic perspective,

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we are all Africans.

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We either live inside Africa today,

102
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or in quite recent exile.

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Another consequence

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of this recent origin of modern humans

105
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is that genetic variants

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
are generally distributed widely in the world,

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in many places,

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they tend to vary as gradients,

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
from a bird's-eye perspective at least.

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And since there are many genetic variants,

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and they have different such gradients,

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
this means that if we determine a DNA sequence --

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a genome from one individual --

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we can quite accurately estimate

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
where that person comes from,

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
provided that its parents or grandparents

117
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
haven't moved around too much.

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But does this then mean,

119
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as many people tend to think,

120
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people --

121
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
on different continents, for example?

122
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well we can begin to ask those questions also.

123
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There is, for example, a project that's underway

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to sequence a thousand individuals --

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
their genomes -- from different parts of the world.

126
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They've sequenced 185 Africans

127
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
from two populations in Africa.

128
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people

129
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in Europe and in China.

130
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And we can begin to say how much variance do we find,

131
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
how many letters that vary

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in at least one of those individual sequences.

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.

134
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences

135
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
between Africans and non-Africans?

136
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Perhaps the biggest difference

137
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
most of us would imagine existed.

138
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And with absolute difference --

139
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I mean a difference

140
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where people inside Africa at a certain position,

141
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter,

142
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and everybody outside Africa has another letter.

143
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the answer to that, among those millions of differences,

144
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is that there is not a single such position.

145
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This may be surprising.

146
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So we can relax the criterion a bit

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and say: How many positions do we find

149
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where 95 percent of people in Africa have

150
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
one variant,

151
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
95 percent another variant,

152
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the number of that is 12.

153
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So this is very surprising.

154
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It means that when we look at people

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and see a person from Africa

156
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and a person from Europe or Asia,

157
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
we cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy,

158
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
predict what the person would carry.

159
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And only for 12 positions

160
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
can we hope to be 95 percent right.

161
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
This may be surprising,

162
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because we can, of course, look at these people

163
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.

164
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So what this means now

165
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is that those traits we then look at

166
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and so readily see --

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
facial features, skin color, hair structure --

168
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
are not determined by single genes with big effects,

169
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but are determined by many different genetic variants

170
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that seem to vary in frequency

171
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
between different parts of the world.

172
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There is another thing with those traits

173
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that we so easily observe in each other

174
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that I think is worthwhile to consider,

175
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and that is that, in a very literal sense,

176
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
they're really on the surface of our bodies.

177
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They are what we just said --

178
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
facial features, hair structure, skin color.

179
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There are also a number of features

180
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that vary between continents like that

181
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest,

182
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or that have to do

183
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
with how our immune systems deal with microbes

184
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that try to invade our bodies.

185
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But so those are all parts of our bodies

186
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
where we very directly interact with our environment,

187
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in a direct confrontation, if you like.

188
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's easy to imagine

189
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
how particularly those parts of our bodies

190
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
were quickly influenced by selection from the environment

191
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and shifted frequencies of genes

192
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that are involved in them.

193
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But if we look on other parts of our bodies

194
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where we don't directly interact with the environment --

195
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
our kidneys, our livers, our hearts --

196
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
there is no way to say,

197
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
by just looking at these organs,

198
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where in the world they would come from.

199
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So there's another interesting thing

200
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that comes from this realization

201
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that humans have a recent common origin in Africa,

202
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and that is that when those humans emerged

203
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
around 100,000 years ago or so,

204
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they were not alone on the planet.

205
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
There were other forms of humans around,

206
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
most famously perhaps, Neanderthals --

207
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
these robust forms of humans,

208
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
compared to the left here

209
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
with a modern human skeleton on the right --

210
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that existed in Western Asia and Europe

211
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
since several hundreds of thousands of years.

212
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So an interesting question is,

213
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
what happened when we met?

214
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What happened to the Neanderthals?

215
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And to begin to answer such questions,

216
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
my research group -- since over 25 years now --

217
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
works on methods to extract DNA

218
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
from remains of Neanderthals

219
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and extinct animals

220
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that are tens of thousands of years old.

221
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So this involves a lot of technical issues

222
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in how you extract the DNA,

223
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
how you convert it to a form you can sequence.

224
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You have to work very carefully

225
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to avoid contamination of experiments

226
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with DNA from yourself.

227
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And this then, in conjunction with these methods

228
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly,

229
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
allowed us last year

230
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome,

231
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so that any one of you

232
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome,

233
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or at least on the 55 percent of it

234
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that we've been able to reconstruct so far.

235
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes

236
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of people who live today.

237
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And one question

238
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that you may then want to ask

239
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is, what happened when we met?

240
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Did we mix or not?

241
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And the way to ask that question

242
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe

243
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and compare it to genomes

244
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of people who live today.

245
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we then look

246
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to do this with pairs of individuals,

247
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
starting with two Africans,

248
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
looking at the two African genomes,

249
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
finding places where they differ from each other,

250
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?

251
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Does it match one African or the other African?

252
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We would expect there to be no difference,

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because Neanderthals were never in Africa.

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They should be equal, have no reason to be closer

255
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to one African than another African.

256
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that's indeed the case.

257
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Statistically speaking, there is no difference

258
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.

259
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But this is different

260
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
if we now look at the European individual and an African.

261
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Then, significantly more often,

262
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
does a Neanderthal match the European

263
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
rather than the African.

264
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual

265
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
versus an African,

266
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often.

267
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This may also be surprising

268
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because the Neanderthals were never in China.

269
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So the model we've proposed to explain this

270
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is that when modern humans came out of Africa

271
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
sometime after 100,000 years ago,

272
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they met Neanderthals.

273
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Presumably, they did so first in the Middle East,

274
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
where there were Neanderthals living.

275
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
If they then mixed with each other there,

276
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
then those modern humans

277
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that became the ancestors

278
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of everyone outside Africa

279
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome

280
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to the rest of the world.

281
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So that today, the people living outside Africa

282
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
have about two and a half percent of their DNA

283
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from Neanderthals.

284
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So having now a Neanderthal genome

285
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
on hand as a reference point

286
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and having the technologies

287
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to look at ancient remains

288
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and extract the DNA,

289
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.

290
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia

291
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in the Altai Mountains

292
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at a place called Denisova,

293
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
a cave site in this mountain here,

294
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
where archeologists in 2008

295
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
found a tiny little piece of bone --

296
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
this is a copy of it --

297
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that they realized came from the last phalanx

298
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of a little finger of a pinky of a human.

299
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And it was well enough preserved

300
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
so we could determine the DNA from this individual,

301
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
even to a greater extent

302
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
than for the Neanderthals actually,

303
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome

304
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and to people today.

305
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And we found that this individual

306
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
shared a common origin for his DNA sequences

307
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.

308
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And further back, 800,000 years ago

309
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is there a common origin

310
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
with present day humans.

311
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So this individual comes from a population

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that shares an origin with Neanderthals,

313
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but far back and then have a long independent history.

314
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We call this group of humans,

315
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that we then described for the first time

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
from this tiny, tiny little piece of bone,

317
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
the Denisovans,

318
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
after this place where they were first described.

319
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So we can then ask for Denisovans

320
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the same things as for the Neanderthals:

321
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Did they mix with ancestors of present day people?

322
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
If we ask that question,

323
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and compare the Denisovan genome

324
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to people around the world,

325
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
we surprisingly find

326
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
no evidence of Denisovan DNA

327
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in any people living even close to Siberia today.

328
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But we do find it in Papua New Guinea

329
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific.

330
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So this presumably means

331
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past,

332
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians

333
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
were ever in Siberia.

334
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So from studying

335
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
these genomes of extinct humans,

336
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like

337
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
when modern humans started coming out of Africa.

338
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
In the West, there were Neanderthals;

339
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in the East, there were Denisovans --

340
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
maybe other forms of humans too

341
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that we've not yet described.

342
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were,

343
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but we know that in Southern Siberia,

344
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans

345
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
at least at some time in the past.

346
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa,

347
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East.

348
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
They meet Neanderthals, mix with them,

349
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
continue to spread over the world,

350
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and somewhere in Southeast Asia,

351
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
they meet Denisovans and mix with them

352
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and continue on out into the Pacific.

353
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And then these earlier forms of humans disappear,

354
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but they live on a little bit today

355
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
in some of us --

356
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA

357
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
from Neanderthals,

358
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and people in Melanesia

359
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
actually have an additional five percent approximately

360
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
from the Denisovans.

361
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Does this then mean that there is after all

362
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
some absolute difference

363
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
between people outside Africa and inside Africa

364
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in that people outside Africa

365
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
have this old component in their genome

366
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
from these extinct forms of humans,

367
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
whereas Africans do not?

368
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Well I don't think that is the case.

369
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Presumably, modern humans

370
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
emerged somewhere in Africa.

371
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They spread across Africa also, of course,

372
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and there were older, earlier forms of humans there.

373
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And since we mixed elsewhere,

374
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I'm pretty sure that one day,

375
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
when we will perhaps have a genome

376
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
of also these earlier forms in Africa,

377
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
we will find that they have also mixed

378
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
with early modern humans in Africa.

379
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So to sum up,

380
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
what have we learned from studying genomes

381
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
of present day humans

382
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and extinct humans?

383
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We learn perhaps many things,

384
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but one thing that I find sort of important to mention

385
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.

386
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We mixed with these earlier forms of humans,

387
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
wherever we met them,

388
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and we mixed with each other ever since.

389
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you for your attention.

390
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000

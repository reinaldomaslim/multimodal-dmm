1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Religion is more than belief.

2
0:00:15.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's power, and it's influence.

3
0:00:18.48,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And that influence affects all of us,

4
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:24,000
every day, regardless of your own belief.

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today,

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability

7
0:00:32.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
than any other sector of our society.

8
0:00:35.96,000 --> 0:00:39,000
For example, if there were a multinational organization,

9
0:00:40.4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
government or corporation today

10
0:00:43.48,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that said no female could be on a leadership board,

11
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
not one woman could have a decision-making authority,

12
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:54,000
not one woman could handle any financial matter,

13
0:00:55.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we would have outrage.

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
There would be sanctions.

15
0:00:58.84,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.

16
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We accept things in our religious lives

17
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we do not accept in our secular lives,

18
0:01:09.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades.

19
0:01:14.04,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up.

20
0:01:18.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself.

21
0:01:22.6,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States.

22
0:01:26.06,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment,

23
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which has been dead for 40 years.

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm the first woman in both sides of my family

25
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.

26
0:01:38.36,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman,

27
0:01:43.2,000 --> 0:01:45,000
except in my religion.

28
0:01:45.4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Throughout all of that time,

29
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion.

30
0:01:51.12,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I grew up in an enormously traditional family.

31
0:01:53.92,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother.

32
0:01:56.08,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My father's actually a religious leader in the community.

33
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing

34
0:02:05.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life.

35
0:02:09.12,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol,

36
0:02:11.96,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you don't smoke, you always do service,

37
0:02:14.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you're a good kid.

38
0:02:16.36,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Some of the rules we had were strict,

39
0:02:19.96,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but you followed the rules because you loved the people

40
0:02:22.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and you loved the religion and you believed.

41
0:02:25.28,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore,

42
0:02:28.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who you dated, who you married.

43
0:02:29.651,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It determined what underwear we wore.

44
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was the kind of religious where everyone I know

45
0:02:36.12,000 --> 0:02:39,000
donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church,

46
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:4,000
including myself.

47
0:02:40.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
From paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent.

48
0:02:44.72,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children

49
0:02:47.8,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission

50
0:02:51.44,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that they would rather have them die

51
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
than return home without honor, having sinned.

52
0:02:57.24,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was the type and the kind of religious

53
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:02,000
where kids kill themselves every single year

54
0:03:03.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay.

55
0:03:07.56,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But I was also the kind of religious

56
0:03:09.6,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where it didn't matter where in the world I lived,

57
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid.

58
0:03:15.96,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life.

59
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I had help raising my little daughter.

60
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead,

61
0:03:27.4,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I accepted without question

62
0:03:29.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth,

63
0:03:32.72,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which we call the priesthood.

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets,

65
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:41,000
disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities,

66
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I gave my religion a free pass

67
0:03:45.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because I loved it.

68
0:03:47.12,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Until I stopped,

69
0:03:49.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated

70
0:03:52.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as the support staff to the real work of men.

71
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I faced this contradiction in myself,

72
0:04:00.08,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I joined with other activists in my community.

73
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.

74
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The first thing we did was raise consciousness.

75
0:04:09.478,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You can't change what you can't see.

76
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We started podcasting, blogging, writing articles.

77
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I created lists of hundreds of ways

78
0:04:17.8,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that men and women are unequal in our community.

79
0:04:20.84,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations.

80
0:04:24.36,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We tried to do things that were unignorable,

81
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings.

82
0:04:33.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
These seem like simple things,

83
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly.

84
0:04:40.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We lost relationships. We lost jobs.

85
0:04:43.84,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We got hate mail on a daily basis.

86
0:04:45.92,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We were attacked in social media and national press.

87
0:04:49.28,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We received death threats.

88
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated.

89
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council,

90
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and were rejected from the communities that we loved

91
0:05:01.32,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.

92
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I began to expect this reaction from my own people.

93
0:05:09.76,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you

94
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or criticize you.

95
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work

96
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left,

97
0:05:25.4,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the same vehemence as the religious right.

98
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility,

99
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
these phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid."

100
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"Don't pay attention to religion."

101
0:05:39.24,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"They're going to be homophobic and sexist."

102
0:05:42.6,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What they didn't understand

103
0:05:44.68,000 --> 0:05:48,000
was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism,

104
0:05:49.28,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it bred religious extremism.

105
0:05:52.64,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Those arguments don't work, and I know because I remember

106
0:05:56.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon.

107
0:06:01.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people

108
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.

109
0:06:10.72,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments.

110
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
When I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle,

111
0:06:18.24,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because I have family and friends.

112
0:06:19.92,000 --> 0:06:21,000
These are my people, and I'm the first to defend them,

113
0:06:22.64,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but the struggle is real.

114
0:06:24.68,000 --> 0:06:27,000
How do we respect someone's religious beliefs

115
0:06:28.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage

116
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that those beliefs may cause others?

117
0:06:34.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer.

118
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:4,000
My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade.

119
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They're intelligent people. They're lovely people.

120
0:06:43.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And let me try to help you understand their perspective.

121
0:06:47.76,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In Mormonism, we believe that after you die,

122
0:06:50.76,000 --> 0:06:53,000
if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals,

123
0:06:54.12,000 --> 0:06:57,000
you can be together as a family again.

124
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And to my parents, me doing something as simple

125
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:02,000
as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders,

126
0:07:03.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that makes me unworthy.

127
0:07:04.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I won't be with my family in the eternities.

128
0:07:08.24,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15,

129
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family.

130
0:07:16.72,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And to my parents, they cannot understand

131
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:23,000
why something as simple as fashion or women's rights

132
0:07:23.44,000 --> 0:07:25,000
would prevent me from seeing my brother again.

133
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And that's the mindset that we're dealing with,

134
0:07:28.92,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and criticism does not change that.

135
0:07:32.04,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope,

136
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
explaining our sides, respecting one another,

137
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs

138
0:07:41.72,000 --> 0:07:44,000
by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult.

139
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The way that we've been able to do that

140
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is to get past those defensive shells

141
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief

142
0:07:54.04,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.

143
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox

144
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and the religious right, what they all don't understand

145
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
was why even care about religious activism?

146
0:08:10.08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said,

147
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"If you don't like religion, just leave."

148
0:08:15.8,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Why would you try to change it?

149
0:08:18.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Because what is taught on the Sabbath

150
0:08:21.342,000 --> 0:08:24,000
leaks into our politics, our health policy,

151
0:08:24.4,000 --> 0:08:25,000
violence around the world.

152
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making.

153
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
These laws get legally and culturally codified.

154
0:08:33.32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation.

155
0:08:38.28,000 --> 0:08:42,000
For example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars

156
0:08:42.88,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to fight same-sex marriage in California.

157
0:08:46.84,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Forty years ago, political historians will say,

158
0:08:51.08,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,

159
0:08:54.96,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today.

160
0:08:58.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
How many lives did that affect?

161
0:09:02.8,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And we can spend time fighting every single one

162
0:09:05.6,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of these little tiny laws and rules,

163
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
or we can ask ourselves,

164
0:09:10.36,000 --> 0:09:16,000
why is gender inequality the default around the world?

165
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Why is that the assumption?

166
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality,

167
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it creates the seeds of normality.

168
0:09:29.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Religions can liberate or subjugate,

169
0:09:32.64,000 --> 0:09:35,000
they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,

170
0:09:35.88,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral

171
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are often not those in charge.

172
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.

173
0:09:46.52,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We need to take them seriously.

174
0:09:49.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about.

175
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But I'll tell you what my people have done.

176
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:58,000
My groups are small, there's hundreds of us,

177
0:09:58.36,000 --> 0:10:,000
but we've had huge impact.

178
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Right now, women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men

179
0:10:03.8,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for the first time.

180
0:10:05.04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Women are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings,

181
0:10:07.8,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they never were before in the general conferences.

182
0:10:10.84,000 --> 0:10:12,000
As of last week, in a historic move,

183
0:10:13.4,000 --> 0:10:16,000
three women were invited down to three leadership boards

184
0:10:16.6,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that oversee the entire church.

185
0:10:18.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community

186
0:10:21.44,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that allow for talk of gender inequality.

187
0:10:23.96,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We've opened up space, regardless of being despised,

188
0:10:27.36,000 --> 0:10:3,000
for more conservative women to step in and make real changes,

189
0:10:31.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the words "women" and "the priesthood" can now be uttered in the same sentence.

190
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I never had that.

191
0:10:38.8,000 --> 0:10:42,000
My daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had,

192
0:10:43.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that's more equal -- we've had an effect.

193
0:10:47.4,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It wasn't easy standing in those lines

194
0:10:50.32,000 --> 0:10:53,000
trying to get into those male meetings.

195
0:10:53.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There were hundreds of us,

196
0:10:55.72,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and one by one, when we got to the door,

197
0:10:58.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we were told, "I'm sorry, this meeting is just for men,"

198
0:11:02.04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting

199
0:11:06.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
as young as 12 years old,

200
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line.

201
0:11:13.08,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But not one woman in that line will forget that day,

202
0:11:15.84,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day.

203
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If we were a multinational corporation or a government, and that had happened,

204
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
there would be outrage,

205
0:11:28.8,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but we're just a religion.

206
0:11:31.24,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We're all just part of religions.

207
0:11:35.12,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We can't keep looking at religion that way,

208
0:11:37.88,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because it doesn't only affect me, it affects my daughter

209
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have,

210
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what they can wear, who they can love and marry,

211
0:11:46.038,000 --> 0:11:49,000
if they have access to reproductive healthcare.

212
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We need to reclaim morality in a secular context

213
0:11:52.52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability

214
0:11:54.8,000 --> 0:11:56,000
for religions all around the world,

215
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
but we need to do it in a respectful way

216
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that breeds cooperation and not extremism.

217
0:12:03.4,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery,

218
0:12:07.48,000 --> 0:12:1,000
standing up for gender equality.

219
0:12:10.84,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's time that half of the world's population

220
0:12:13.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
had voice and equality within our world's religions,

221
0:12:16.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
churches, synagogues, mosques and shrines around the world.

222
0:12:20.88,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I'm working on my people. What are you doing for yours?

223
0:12:25.4,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Applause)

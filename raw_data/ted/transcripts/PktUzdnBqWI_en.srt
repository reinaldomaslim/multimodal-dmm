1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Delighted to be here

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is beauty.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
actually, for a living.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I try to figure out intellectually,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
philosophically, psychologically,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what the experience of beauty is,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
what sensibly can be said about it

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now this is an extremely complicated subject,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in part because the things that we call beautiful

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are so different.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I mean just think of the sheer variety --

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a baby's face,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or the plays of Chekhov,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a central California landscape,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Der Rosenkavalier,"

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a stunning match-winning goal

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in a World Cup soccer match,

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a Jane Austen novel,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This brief list includes human beings,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
natural landforms,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
works of art and skilled human actions.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
An account that explains the presence of beauty

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in everything on this list

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is not going to be easy.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I can, however, give you at least a taste

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of what I regard

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as the most powerful theory of beauty

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we yet have.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
not from a postmodern art theorist

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or a bigwig art critic.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
No, this theory

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
comes from an expert

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and you know who I mean:

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Charles Darwin.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Of course, a lot of people think they already know

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the proper answer to the question,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"What is beauty?"

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's in the eye of the beholder.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's whatever moves you personally.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Or, as some people,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
especially academics prefer,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
beauty is in the culturally conditioned

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
eye of the beholder.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
People agree that paintings or movies or music

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are beautiful

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
travel across cultures

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with great ease.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Beethoven is adored in Japan.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in British museums,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
while Shakespeare is translated

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
into every major language of the Earth.

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Or just think about American jazz

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or American movies --

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
they go everywhere.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There are many differences among the arts,

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but there are also universal,

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and values.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
How can we explain

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this universality?

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a Darwinian evolutionary history

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We need to reverse-engineer

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
our present artistic tastes and preferences

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and explain how they came

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to be engraved in our minds

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
by the actions of both our prehistoric,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
largely pleistocene environments,

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where we became fully human,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but also by the social situations

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in which we evolved.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This reverse engineering

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
can also enlist help

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
from the human record

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
preserved in prehistory.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And it should take into account

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
what we know of the aesthetic interests

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of isolated hunter-gatherer bands

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now, I personally

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
have no doubt whatsoever

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that the experience of beauty,

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with its emotional intensity and pleasure,

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
belongs to our evolved human psychology.

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The experience of beauty is one component

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Beauty is an adaptive effect,

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which we extend

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and intensify

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in the creation and enjoyment

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of works of art and entertainment.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
As many of you will know,

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The first of these is natural selection --

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that's random mutation and selective retention --

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --

113
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Natural selection also explains

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
many basic revulsions,

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or fears, such as the fear of snakes

118
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Natural selection also explains pleasures --

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
sexual pleasure,

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,

122
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
from ripe fruits through chocolate malts

124
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and barbecued ribs.

125
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The other great principle of evolution

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is sexual selection,

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and it operates very differently.

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The peacock's magnificent tail

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is the most famous example of this.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It did not evolve for natural survival.

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In fact, it goes against natural survival.

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
No, the peacock's tail

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
results from the mating choices

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
made by peahens.

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's quite a familiar story.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's women who actually push history forward.

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Darwin himself, by the way,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
had no doubts that the peacock's tail

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
He actually used that word.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we can say that the experience of beauty

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is one of the ways that evolution has

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
of arousing and sustaining

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
interest or fascination,

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
even obsession,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in order to encourage us

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
toward making the most adaptive decisions

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
for survival and reproduction.

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Beauty is nature's way

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of acting at a distance,

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
so to speak.

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I mean, you can't expect to eat

154
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
an adaptively beneficial landscape.

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It would hardly do to eat your baby

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or your lover.

157
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So evolution's trick

158
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is to make them beautiful,

159
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to have them exert a kind of magnetism

160
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
the magnetic pull

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of beautiful landscapes.

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
People in very different cultures

165
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
all over the world

166
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
tend to like a particular kind of landscape,

167
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a landscape that just happens to be similar

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

169
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This landscape shows up today

170
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
on calendars, on postcards,

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in the design of golf courses and public parks

172
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and in gold-framed pictures

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that hang in living rooms

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
from New York to New Zealand.

175
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape

176
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
featuring open spaces

177
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of low grasses

178
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
interspersed with copses of trees.

179
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The trees, by the way, are often preferred

180
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
if they fork near the ground,

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up

182
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if you were in a tight fix.

183
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The landscape shows the presence

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of water directly in view,

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or evidence of water in a bluish distance,

186
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
indications of animal or bird life

187
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
as well as diverse greenery

188
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and finally -- get this --

189
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a path

190
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
or a road,

191
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,

192
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that extends into the distance,

193
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
almost inviting you to follow it.

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,

195
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
even by people in countries

196
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that don't have it.

197
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The ideal savanna landscape

198
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is one of the clearest examples

199
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
where human beings everywhere

200
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
find beauty

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in similar visual experience.

202
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But, someone might argue,

203
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that's natural beauty.

204
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
How about artistic beauty?

205
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?

206
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
No, I don't think it is.

207
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory

208
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to say something about it.

209
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It is widely assumed

210
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that the earliest human artworks

211
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings

212
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that we all know from Lascaux

213
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and Chauvet.

214
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Chauvet caves

215
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
are about 32,000 years old,

216
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
along with a few small, realistic sculptures

217
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of women and animals from the same period.

218
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But artistic and decorative skills

219
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are actually much older than that.

220
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Beautiful shell necklaces

221
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,

222
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
as well as ochre body paint,

223
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
have been found

224
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
from around 100,000 years ago.

225
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts

226
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
are older even than this.

227
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I have in mind

228
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.

229
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The oldest stone tools are choppers

230
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.

231
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.

232
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
These crude tools

233
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
were around for thousands of centuries,

234
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
until around 1.4 million years ago

235
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when Homo erectus

236
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
started shaping

237
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
single, thin stone blades,

238
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
sometimes rounded ovals,

239
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but often in what are to our eyes

240
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf

241
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or teardrop form.

242
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
These Acheulian hand axes --

243
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
they're named after St. Acheul in France,

244
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
where finds were made in 19th century --

245
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
have been unearthed in their thousands,

246
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,

247
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
almost everywhere Homo erectus

248
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and Homo ergaster roamed.

249
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes

250
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
shows that they can't have been made

251
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
for butchering animals.

252
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And the plot really thickens when you realize

253
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that, unlike other pleistocene tools,

254
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the hand axes often exhibit

255
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
no evidence of wear

256
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
on their delicate blade edges.

257
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And some, in any event, are too big

258
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to use for butchery.

259
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Their symmetry, their attractive materials

260
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and, above all,

261
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
their meticulous workmanship

262
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are simply quite beautiful

263
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to our eyes, even today.

264
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So what were these ancient --

265
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,

266
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but they're at the same time

267
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
somehow familiar.

268
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
What were these artifacts for?

269
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The best available answer

270
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is that they were literally

271
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the earliest known works of art,

272
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
practical tools transformed

273
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
into captivating aesthetic objects,

274
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
contemplated both for their elegant shape

275
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.

276
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Hand axes mark

277
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
an evolutionary advance in human history --

278
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
tools fashioned to function

279
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --

280
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that is to say, displays

281
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that are performances

282
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
like the peacock's tail,

283
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
except that, unlike hair and feathers,

284
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the hand axes are consciously

285
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
cleverly crafted.

286
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Competently made hand axes

287
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
indicated desirable personal qualities --

288
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
intelligence, fine motor control,

289
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
planning ability,

290
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
conscientiousness

291
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and sometimes access to rare materials.

292
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Over tens of thousands of generations,

293
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
such skills increased the status

294
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
of those who displayed them

295
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and gained a reproductive advantage

296
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
over the less capable.

297
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You know, it's an old line,

298
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but it has been shown to work --

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"

300
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

301
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Except, of course, what's interesting about this

302
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,

303
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
because the Homo erectus

304
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that made these objects

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
did not have language.

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It's hard to grasp,

307
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but it's an incredible fact.

308
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This object was made

309
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
by a hominid ancestor,

310
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,

311
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
between 50,000 and 100,000 years

312
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
before language.

313
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Stretching over a million years,

314
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
the hand axe tradition

315
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is the longest artistic tradition

316
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in human and proto-human history.

317
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --

318
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
as they were then called, finally --

319
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
were doubtless finding new ways

320
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to amuse and amaze each other

321
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
by, who knows, telling jokes,

322
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.

323
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.

324
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
For us moderns,

325
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
virtuoso technique

326
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is used to create imaginary worlds

327
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in fiction and in movies,

328
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to express intense emotions

329
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
with music, painting and dance.

330
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But still,

331
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
one fundamental trait

332
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of the ancestral personality persists

333
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
in our aesthetic cravings:

334
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the beauty we find

335
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in skilled performances.

336
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
From Lascaux to the Louvre

337
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to Carnegie Hall,

338
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
human beings

339
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
have a permanent innate taste

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
for virtuoso displays in the arts.

341
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We find beauty

342
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in something done well.

343
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window

344
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
displaying a beautifully cut

345
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
teardrop-shaped stone,

346
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
don't be so sure

347
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
it's just your culture telling you

348
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

349
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Your distant ancestors loved that shape

350
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,

351
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
even before

352
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
they could put their love into words.

353
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

354
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
No, it's deep in our minds.

355
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills

356
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and rich emotional lives

357
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
of our most ancient ancestors.

358
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Our powerful reaction to images,

359
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to the expression of emotion in art,

360
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,

361
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
will be with us and our descendants

362
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for as long as the human race exists.

363
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Thank you.

364
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

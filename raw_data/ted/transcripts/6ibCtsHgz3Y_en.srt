Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.607,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I was trained to become a gymnast

3
0:00:15.319,000 --> 0:00:18,000
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.

4
0:00:18.975,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When I was in the first grade, the government

5
0:00:21.52,000 --> 0:00:23,000
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,

6
0:00:24.127,000 --> 0:00:26,000
all expenses paid.

7
0:00:26.175,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But my tiger mother said, "No."

8
0:00:28.823,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My parents wanted me to become

9
0:00:30.959,000 --> 0:00:32,000
an engineer like them.

10
0:00:33.063,000 --> 0:00:35,000
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

11
0:00:35.15,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:

12
0:00:38.959,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a safe and well-paid job.

13
0:00:41.892,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It is not important if I like the job or not.

14
0:00:44.687,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.

15
0:00:49.967,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That is me playing my imaginary piano.

16
0:00:53.615,000 --> 0:00:55,000
An opera singer must start training young

17
0:00:55.799,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to learn acrobatics,

18
0:00:57.383,000 --> 0:00:59,000
so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.

19
0:01:00.327,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I even wrote to the school principal

20
0:01:02.594,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the host of a radio show.

21
0:01:05.355,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But no adults liked the idea.

22
0:01:09.161,000 --> 0:01:11,000
No adults believed I was serious.

23
0:01:11.884,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,

24
0:01:15.128,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just as powerless as I was.

25
0:01:17.884,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.

26
0:01:23.649,000 --> 0:01:25,000
My dream would never come true.

27
0:01:26.616,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was afraid that for the rest of my life

28
0:01:29.924,000 --> 0:01:31,000
some second-class happiness

29
0:01:31.961,000 --> 0:01:33,000
would be the best I could hope for.

30
0:01:34.498,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But that's so unfair.

31
0:01:36.926,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I was determined to find another calling.

32
0:01:40.728,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.

33
0:01:43.465,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I turned to books.

34
0:01:45.697,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice

35
0:01:49.339,000 --> 0:01:53,000
from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]

36
0:01:54.216,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I found my role model of an independent woman

37
0:01:57.289,000 --> 0:02:,000
when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]

38
0:02:01.133,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]

39
0:02:04.83,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.

40
0:02:08.795,000 --> 0:02:1,000
["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]

41
0:02:10.866,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I came to the U.S. in 1995,

42
0:02:14.057,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so which books did I read here first?

43
0:02:16.938,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Books banned in China, of course.

44
0:02:20.463,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.

45
0:02:24.133,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.

46
0:02:28.235,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The Bible is interesting, but strange.

47
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:34.445,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That's a topic for a different day.

49
0:02:37.916,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:

50
0:02:41.211,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"You shall honor your father and mother."

51
0:02:44.19,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,

52
0:02:47.14,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and better, than obey."

53
0:02:48.879,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So it becomes my tool to climb out

54
0:02:51.383,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of this Confucian guilt trap

55
0:02:53.499,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and to restart my relationship with my parents.

56
0:02:57.771,000 --> 0:03:,000
Encountering a new culture also started my habit

57
0:03:00.793,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of comparative reading.

58
0:03:02.565,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It offers many insights.

59
0:03:04.42,000 --> 0:03:08,000
For example, I found this map out of place at first

60
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because this is what Chinese students grew up with.

61
0:03:14.085,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It had never occurred to me,

62
0:03:15.586,000 --> 0:03:18,000
China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.

63
0:03:18.721,000 --> 0:03:22,000
A map actually carries somebody's view.

64
0:03:22.974,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.

65
0:03:25.382,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's a standard practice in the academic world.

66
0:03:28.686,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There are even research fields

67
0:03:30.154,000 --> 0:03:33,000
such as comparative religion and comparative literature.

68
0:03:34.099,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Compare and contrast gives scholars

69
0:03:36.334,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a more complete understanding of a topic.

70
0:03:39.34,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So I thought, well, if comparative reading

71
0:03:41.093,000 --> 0:03:44,000
works for research, why not do it in daily life too?

72
0:03:44.929,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So I started reading books in pairs.

73
0:03:48.304,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So they can be about people --

74
0:03:49.518,000 --> 0:03:49,000
["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --

75
0:03:50.401,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who are involved in the same event,

76
0:03:52.909,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or friends with shared experiences.

77
0:03:55.588,000 --> 0:03:56,000
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]

78
0:03:56.988,000 --> 0:04:,000
I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)

79
0:04:01.386,000 --> 0:04:03,000
[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --

80
0:04:03.498,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or similar stories from different cultures,

81
0:04:06.635,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]

82
0:04:09.516,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For example, both the Christ and the Buddha

83
0:04:12.909,000 --> 0:04:14,000
went through three temptations.

84
0:04:15.342,000 --> 0:04:16,000
For the Christ, the temptations

85
0:04:17.144,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are economic, political and spiritual.

86
0:04:21.119,000 --> 0:04:25,000
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:

87
0:04:25.445,000 --> 0:04:32,000
lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.

88
0:04:32.763,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun

89
0:04:35.802,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to read your favorite books in two languages.

90
0:04:37.699,000 --> 0:04:38,000
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]

91
0:04:38.951,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.

92
0:04:42.527,000 --> 0:04:46,000
For example, it's through translation that I realized

93
0:04:46.735,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!

94
0:04:52.708,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.

95
0:04:57.997,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:01.258,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people

97
0:05:06.645,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of the past and the present.

98
0:05:09.29,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.

99
0:05:13.525,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Having a dream shattered really is nothing

100
0:05:16.202,000 --> 0:05:18,000
compared to what many others have suffered.

101
0:05:19.138,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I have come to believe that coming true

102
0:05:21.866,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is not the only purpose of a dream.

103
0:05:25.146,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch

104
0:05:29.047,000 --> 0:05:31,000
with where dreams come from,

105
0:05:31.162,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.

106
0:05:34.066,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.

107
0:05:38.288,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So because of books, I'm here today,

108
0:05:40.542,000 --> 0:05:43,000
happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,

109
0:05:44.202,000 --> 0:05:45,000
most of the time.

110
0:05:45.952,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So may books be always with you.

111
0:05:49.513,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Thank you.

112
0:05:50.991,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:52.839,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Thank you. (Applause)

114
0:05:56.484,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:15,000
1.3 billion years ago,

2
0:00:16.104,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in a distant, distant galaxy,

3
0:00:19.198,000 --> 0:00:22,000
two black holes locked into a spiral,

4
0:00:22.576,000 --> 0:00:24,000
falling inexorably towards each other

5
0:00:25.234,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and collided,

6
0:00:26.632,000 --> 0:00:28,000
converting three Suns' worth of stuff

7
0:00:29.599,000 --> 0:00:31,000
into pure energy in a tenth of a second.

8
0:00:33.769,000 --> 0:00:35,000
For that brief moment in time,

9
0:00:36.538,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the glow was brighter than all the stars

10
0:00:39.974,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in all the galaxies

11
0:00:41.659,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in all of the known Universe.

12
0:00:44.426,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It was a very

13
0:00:46.226,000 --> 0:00:47,000
big

14
0:00:47.401,000 --> 0:00:48,000
bang.

15
0:00:50.297,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But they didn't release their energy in light.

16
0:00:53.135,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I mean, you know, they're black holes.

17
0:00:57.229,000 --> 0:01:01,000
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself,

18
0:01:02.094,000 --> 0:01:05,000
making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.

19
0:01:05.731,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.

20
0:01:09.317,000 --> 0:01:11,000
1.3 billion years ago,

21
0:01:11.952,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.

22
0:01:16.25,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Since then, Earth has made and evolved

23
0:01:19.926,000 --> 0:01:24,000
corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.

24
0:01:26.063,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And about 25 years ago,

25
0:01:28.602,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a particularly audacious set of people --

26
0:01:30.644,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech --

27
0:01:36.047,000 --> 0:01:37,000
decided that it would be really neat

28
0:01:37.865,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to build a giant laser detector

29
0:01:40.602,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with which to search for the gravitational waves

30
0:01:43.008,000 --> 0:01:45,000
from things like colliding black holes.

31
0:01:46.308,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, most people thought they were nuts.

32
0:01:49.287,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts

33
0:01:53.225,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.

34
0:01:58.288,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So after decades of development,

35
0:02:01.657,000 --> 0:02:03,000
construction and imagination

36
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and a breathtaking amount of hard work,

37
0:02:08.168,000 --> 0:02:11,000
they built their detector, called LIGO:

38
0:02:11.343,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

39
0:02:16.651,000 --> 0:02:17,000
For the last several years,

40
0:02:17.985,000 --> 0:02:2,000
LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,

41
0:02:21.608,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.

42
0:02:24.624,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.

43
0:02:28.116,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In early September of 2015,

44
0:02:31.005,000 --> 0:02:33,000
LIGO turned on for a final test run

45
0:02:33.885,000 --> 0:02:35,000
while they sorted out a few lingering details.

46
0:02:37.978,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And on September 14 of 2015,

47
0:02:42.28,000 --> 0:02:45,000
just days after the detector had gone live,

48
0:02:46.842,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes

49
0:02:50.653,000 --> 0:02:51,000
passed through the Earth.

50
0:02:52.977,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And they passed through you and me.

51
0:02:55.59,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And they passed through the detector.

52
0:02:59.143,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life

53
0:03:01.668,000 --> 0:03:02,000
more emotionally intense than that.

54
0:03:03.383,000 --> 0:03:04,000
One is the birth of my daughter.

55
0:03:04.946,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.

56
0:03:10.051,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.

57
0:03:14.491,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)

58
0:03:21.416,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,

59
0:03:25.61,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a theoretical physicist at MIT,

60
0:03:27.825,000 --> 0:03:29,000
who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes

61
0:03:30.634,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,

62
0:03:34.187,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for the past 23 years.

63
0:03:36.892,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.

64
0:03:41.489,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A gravitational wave is a ripple

65
0:03:44.581,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the shape of space and time.

66
0:03:47.468,000 --> 0:03:49,000
As the wave passes by,

67
0:03:49.503,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it stretches space and everything in it

68
0:03:51.906,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in one direction,

69
0:03:53.089,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and compresses it in the other.

70
0:03:55.893,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity

71
0:03:58.966,000 --> 0:04:01,000
doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.

72
0:04:02.922,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."

73
0:04:08.08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So the trouble with gravitational waves

74
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.

75
0:04:13.302,000 --> 0:04:16,000
For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 --

76
0:04:16.724,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed

77
0:04:21.442,000 --> 0:04:22,000
under the action of that wave --

78
0:04:23.734,000 --> 0:04:25,000
when the waves hit, they stretched the average person

79
0:04:26.663,000 --> 0:04:29,000
by one part in 10 to the 21.

80
0:04:29.798,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,

81
0:04:32.694,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and a one.

82
0:04:35.519,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.

83
0:04:39.523,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy --

84
0:04:45.429,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they would have to measure the length of those detectors

85
0:04:49.078,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus

86
0:04:53.083,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of an atom.

87
0:04:54.265,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And that's preposterous.

88
0:04:56.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity,

89
0:05:00.497,000 --> 0:05:02,000
LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne

90
0:05:04.508,000 --> 0:05:06,000
described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:

91
0:05:07.519,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted

92
0:05:10.694,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in constructing such detectors

93
0:05:13.031,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are enormous.

94
0:05:15.574,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But physicists are ingenious,

95
0:05:18.408,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and with the support of a broad lay public,

96
0:05:21.972,000 --> 0:05:23,000
all obstacles will surely be overcome."

97
0:05:26.138,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Thorne published that in 1973,

98
0:05:29.682,000 --> 0:05:32,000
42 years before he succeeded.

99
0:05:35.149,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, coming back to LIGO,

100
0:05:36.432,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear

101
0:05:39.67,000 --> 0:05:4,000
more than it does like an eye.

102
0:05:41.629,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I want to explain what that means.

103
0:05:43.863,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,

104
0:05:46.209,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that's much smaller than the things around you,

105
0:05:48.806,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the features on people's faces,

106
0:05:50.329,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the size of your cell phone.

107
0:05:53.582,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And that's really useful,

108
0:05:54.813,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,

109
0:05:58.044,000 --> 0:06:,000
by looking at the light coming from different spots

110
0:06:00.456,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in the scene about you.

111
0:06:01.631,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Sound is different.

112
0:06:04.111,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.

113
0:06:07.585,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And that makes it really difficult --

114
0:06:09.386,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image

115
0:06:12.45,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of something you really care about.

116
0:06:14.292,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Your child's face.

117
0:06:16.777,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch

118
0:06:20.931,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and tone and rhythm and volume

119
0:06:24.073,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to infer a story behind the sounds.

120
0:06:28.065,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's Alice talking.

121
0:06:29.943,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's Bob interrupting.

122
0:06:31.5,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Silly Bob.

123
0:06:33.809,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, the same is true of gravitational waves.

124
0:06:37.688,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.

125
0:06:42.776,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But by listening to changes

126
0:06:44.476,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in the amplitude and frequency of those waves,

127
0:06:47.943,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we can hear the story that those waves are telling.

128
0:06:52.224,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And at least for LIGO,

129
0:06:53.789,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.

130
0:06:58.011,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,

131
0:07:03.121,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.

132
0:07:07.089,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For example, listening to gravity, just in this way,

133
0:07:11.244,000 --> 0:07:13,000
can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,

134
0:07:13.958,000 --> 0:07:16,000
something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.

135
0:07:17.776,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning,

136
0:07:20.271,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you get a very simple chirp: whoop!

137
0:07:22.469,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,

138
0:07:26.146,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but with a modulation on top of it,

139
0:07:27.892,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!

140
0:07:30.281,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.

141
0:07:35.213,000 --> 0:07:38,000
AA: So on September 14, 2015,

142
0:07:38.524,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a date that's definitely going to live in my memory,

143
0:07:41.474,000 --> 0:07:43,000
LIGO heard this:

144
0:07:43.743,000 --> 0:07:44,000
[Whirring sound]

145
0:07:46.416,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --

146
0:07:51.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,

147
0:07:54.558,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that were whirling around at a rate

148
0:07:56.274,000 --> 0:07:58,000
comparable to what goes on in your blender.

149
0:07:59.331,000 --> 0:08:01,000
AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.

150
0:08:02.157,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,

151
0:08:05.466,000 --> 0:08:07,000
one with a mass of 29 Suns

152
0:08:07.67,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

153
0:08:10.481,000 --> 0:08:12,000
whirling around each other 100 times per second

154
0:08:13.178,000 --> 0:08:14,000
before they collide.

155
0:08:14.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Just imagine the power of that.

156
0:08:16.819,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's fantastic.

157
0:08:19.167,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And we know it because we heard it.

158
0:08:23.827,000 --> 0:08:25,000
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.

159
0:08:27.049,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe

160
0:08:30.782,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that we've never had before.

161
0:08:32.663,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe

162
0:08:35.751,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and hear the invisible.

163
0:08:39.496,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And there's a lot out there that we can't see --

164
0:08:42.556,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in practice or even in principle.

165
0:08:44.208,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So supernova, for example:

166
0:08:46.241,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.

167
0:08:50.709,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They're very useful;

168
0:08:51.884,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.

169
0:08:54.252,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,

170
0:08:57.283,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers

171
0:08:59.812,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of iron and carbon and silicon.

172
0:09:01.911,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.

173
0:09:04.24,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass --

174
0:09:08.18,000 --> 0:09:09,000
totally transparent.

175
0:09:10.512,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore

176
0:09:12.933,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the first few moments of the Universe,

177
0:09:15.796,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but we'll never see them,

178
0:09:17.468,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.

179
0:09:22.703,000 --> 0:09:23,000
With gravitational waves,

180
0:09:24.917,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.

181
0:09:28.425,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Perhaps most importantly,

182
0:09:30.243,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'm positive that there are things out there

183
0:09:33.3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that we've never seen

184
0:09:34.915,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that we may never be able to see

185
0:09:36.692,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and that we haven't even imagined --

186
0:09:39.969,000 --> 0:09:41,000
things that we'll only discover by listening.

187
0:09:43.255,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And in fact, even in that very first event,

188
0:09:45.939,000 --> 0:09:48,000
LIGO found things that we didn't expect.

189
0:09:49.564,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,

190
0:09:53.079,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:

191
0:09:56.741,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes

192
0:09:59.975,000 --> 0:10:,000
that we observed here

193
0:10:01.261,000 --> 0:10:02,000
are the dinosaurs of the Universe.

194
0:10:03.063,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,

195
0:10:06.762,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones

196
0:10:09.432,000 --> 0:10:1,000
with which we do this archeology.

197
0:10:11.074,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So it lets us really get a whole nother angle

198
0:10:13.646,000 --> 0:10:14,000
on what's out there in the Universe

199
0:10:15.551,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,

200
0:10:18.338,000 --> 0:10:2,000
how we came to be out of this whole mess.

201
0:10:22.304,000 --> 0:10:23,000
AA: Our challenge now

202
0:10:23.98,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is to be as audacious as possible.

203
0:10:27.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors

204
0:10:30.766,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that can listen to the Universe,

205
0:10:32.359,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.

206
0:10:35.89,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Our job is to dream up and build new observatories --

207
0:10:39.102,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a whole new generation of observatories --

208
0:10:41.157,000 --> 0:10:42,000
on the ground, in space.

209
0:10:43.559,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?

210
0:10:48.973,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Our job now is to dream big.

211
0:10:51.552,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Dream with us.

212
0:10:52.807,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Thank you.

213
0:10:53.99,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

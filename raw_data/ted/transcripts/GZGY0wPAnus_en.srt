1
0:00:12.865,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Do you think it's possible to control someone's attention?

2
0:00:17.664,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Even more than that, what about predicting human behavior?

3
0:00:22.157,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think those are interesting ideas.

4
0:00:24.036,000 --> 0:00:26,000
For me, that would be the perfect superpower,

5
0:00:26.259,000 --> 0:00:28,000
actually kind of an evil way of approaching it.

6
0:00:28.616,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years

7
0:00:31.743,000 --> 0:00:34,000
studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way:

8
0:00:35.245,000 --> 0:00:36,000
picking pockets.

9
0:00:37.201,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When we think of misdirection,

10
0:00:38.741,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we think of something as looking off to the side,

11
0:00:41.106,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when actually the things right in front of us

12
0:00:43.355,000 --> 0:00:44,000
are often the hardest to see,

13
0:00:44.978,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the things that you look at every day that you're blinded to.

14
0:00:47.941,000 --> 0:00:5,000
For example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now?

15
0:00:52.671,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Great. Double-check.

16
0:00:53.912,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Make sure you still have them.

17
0:00:55.489,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I was doing some shopping before.

18
0:00:57.195,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:58.274,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You've looked at them a few times today,

20
0:01:00.216,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but I'll ask you a question.

21
0:01:01.59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Without looking at it directly yet,

22
0:01:03.467,000 --> 0:01:06,000
can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?

23
0:01:07.95,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Bring them out, check and see how accurate you were.

24
0:01:14.382,000 --> 0:01:15,000
How'd you do?

25
0:01:15.557,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Show of hands. Did we get it?

26
0:01:18.326,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now that you're done, close them down.

27
0:01:20.184,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Every phone has something in common.

28
0:01:21.936,000 --> 0:01:22,000
No matter how you organize the icons,

29
0:01:23.943,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you still have a clock on the front.

30
0:01:25.703,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So, without looking at your phone, what time was it?

31
0:01:29.568,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You just looked at your clock, right?

32
0:01:31.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Interesting idea.

33
0:01:32.735,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Let's take that a step further with a game of trust.

34
0:01:35.203,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Close your eyes.

35
0:01:36.966,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard

36
0:01:39.632,000 --> 0:01:41,000
there's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes.

37
0:01:42.655,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.

38
0:01:46.303,000 --> 0:01:48,000
With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?

39
0:01:49.742,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Make your best guess.

40
0:01:51.163,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What color is my shirt? What color is my tie?

41
0:01:54.671,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now open your eyes.

42
0:01:56.046,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Show of hands, were you right?

43
0:01:58.776,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Interesting, isn't it?

44
0:01:59.951,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.

45
0:02:03.095,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But I have a different theory about that model of attention.

46
0:02:06.055,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.

47
0:02:09.614,000 --> 0:02:12,000
For me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.

48
0:02:12.972,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors,

49
0:02:15.763,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and inside your brain is a little security guard.

50
0:02:18.121,000 --> 0:02:19,000
For me, I like to call him Frank.

51
0:02:20.532,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So Frank is sitting at a desk.

52
0:02:22.512,000 --> 0:02:24,000
He's got lots of cool information in front of him,

53
0:02:24.875,000 --> 0:02:25,000
high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,

54
0:02:26.749,000 --> 0:02:29,000
he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears,

55
0:02:29.879,000 --> 0:02:31,000
all these senses, all these perceptions.

56
0:02:32.354,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But attention is what steers your perceptions,

57
0:02:34.923,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it's what controls your reality.

58
0:02:36.717,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's the gateway to the mind.

59
0:02:38.576,000 --> 0:02:4,000
If you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.

60
0:02:41.411,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.

61
0:02:44.922,000 --> 0:02:45,000
For example, the cocktail effect:

62
0:02:46.588,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You're in a party, having conversations with someone,

63
0:02:49.092,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and yet you can recognize your name

64
0:02:50.799,000 --> 0:02:52,000
without realizing you were listening to that.

65
0:02:52.976,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this,

66
0:02:56.05,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to play with your attention as a limited resource.

67
0:02:58.919,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So if I could control how you spend your attention,

68
0:03:02.054,000 --> 0:03:05,000
if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.

69
0:03:05.087,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, instead of doing it like misdirection

70
0:03:07.871,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and throwing it off to the side,

71
0:03:09.419,000 --> 0:03:11,000
instead, what I choose to focus on is Frank,

72
0:03:11.903,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to be able to play with the Frank inside your head,

73
0:03:14.474,000 --> 0:03:15,000
your security guard,

74
0:03:15.649,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and get you, instead of focusing on your external senses,

75
0:03:18.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
just to go internal for a second.

76
0:03:21.365,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?

77
0:03:24.575,000 --> 0:03:25,000
What just happened? Do you have a wallet?

78
0:03:26.552,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Do you have an American Express in your wallet?

79
0:03:28.815,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And when I do that, your Frank turns around.

80
0:03:31.85,000 --> 0:03:33,000
He accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.

81
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape

82
0:03:36.383,000 --> 0:03:38,000
at the same time that he's trying to process new data.

83
0:03:39.263,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This sounds like a good theory,

84
0:03:40.789,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but I could talk for a long time, tell you lots of things,

85
0:03:43.564,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and a portion of them may be true,

86
0:03:45.294,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.

87
0:03:48.378,000 --> 0:03:5,000
If I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping.

88
0:03:50.941,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Just hold still where you are.

89
0:03:55.503,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Hello, how are you? It's lovely to see you.

90
0:03:58.211,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Wonderful job onstage.

91
0:03:59.386,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Lovely watch, it doesn't come off very well.

92
0:04:01.474,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Do you have a ring as well?

93
0:04:02.902,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Good. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet.

94
0:04:05.272,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Hard to tell where to start, so many great things.

95
0:04:07.765,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

96
0:04:09.449,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Hi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are.

97
0:04:12.386,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You're married, you follow directions well.

98
0:04:14.43,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Nice to meet you, sir.

99
0:04:15.604,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here?

100
0:04:19.288,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well.

101
0:04:22.082,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Hi, sir, how are you?

102
0:04:23.566,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Good to see you, sir. You have a ring, a watch.

103
0:04:25.795,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.

104
0:04:27.898,000 --> 0:04:29,000
AR: Well, we'll find one for you. Come on up this way, Joe.

105
0:04:30.703,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Give Joe a round of applause. Come on up, Joe. Let's play a game.

106
0:04:33.798,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:38.437,000 --> 0:04:39,000
AR: Pardon me.

108
0:04:40.535,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I don't think I need this clicker anymore.

109
0:04:42.651,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

110
0:04:44.603,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Come on up to the stage, Joe. Let's play a little game now.

111
0:04:47.437,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Anything in your front pockets?

112
0:04:49.132,000 --> 0:04:5,000
J: Money.

113
0:04:50.307,000 --> 0:04:52,000
AR: Money! All right, let's try that.

114
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Can you stand right over this way for me?

115
0:04:55.352,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Turn around and, let's see,

116
0:04:56.701,000 --> 0:04:58,000
if I give you something that belongs to me,

117
0:04:58.741,000 --> 0:05:,000
this is just something I have,

118
0:05:00.952,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a poker chip.

119
0:05:02.131,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Hold out your hand for me.

120
0:05:04.044,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Watch it closely.

121
0:05:05.218,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is a task for you to focus on.

122
0:05:07.439,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You have your money in your front pocket?

123
0:05:09.598,000 --> 0:05:1,000
J: Yup. AR: Good.

124
0:05:10.773,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.

125
0:05:14.489,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,

126
0:05:16.246,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and that was rather traumatizing for me.

127
0:05:18.183,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I wanted his wallet, he gave me his number.

128
0:05:20.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Big miscommunication.

129
0:05:21.403,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:22.428,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Let's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight.

131
0:05:24.61,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?

132
0:05:26.555,000 --> 0:05:27,000
J: I do.

133
0:05:27.729,000 --> 0:05:29,000
AR: Would you be surprised if I took it? Say yes.

134
0:05:30.052,000 --> 0:05:31,000
J: Very. AR: Good.

135
0:05:31.227,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Open your hand. Thank you very much.

136
0:05:33.034,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'll cheat if you give me a chance.

137
0:05:34.758,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.

138
0:05:36.846,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.

139
0:05:38.841,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Did you see it go? Joe: No.

140
0:05:41.039,000 --> 0:05:42,000
AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.

141
0:05:42.873,000 --> 0:05:45,000
While we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder.

142
0:05:47.055,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Go ahead and take it off.

143
0:05:48.566,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, let's try that again.

144
0:05:50.038,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.

145
0:05:51.968,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Put your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.

146
0:05:54.809,000 --> 0:05:56,000
If I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder.

147
0:05:57.983,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

148
0:05:59.423,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Joe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.

149
0:06:02.019,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You'll get it eventually. I have faith in you.

150
0:06:04.217,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Squeeze firm. You're human, you're not slow.

151
0:06:06.331,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's back on your shoulder.

152
0:06:08.241,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You were focused on your hand, distracted.

153
0:06:10.463,000 --> 0:06:12,000
While you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off.

154
0:06:13.353,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Yet you had something inside your pocket.

155
0:06:15.616,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Do you remember what it was?

156
0:06:17.418,000 --> 0:06:18,000
J: Money.

157
0:06:18.593,000 --> 0:06:2,000
AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?

158
0:06:20.661,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

159
0:06:21.686,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Oh, there it was. Put it away.

160
0:06:23.656,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We're just shopping.

161
0:06:24.831,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This trick's more about the timing.

162
0:06:26.543,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm going to try to push it inside your hand.

163
0:06:28.709,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Put your other hand on top, would you?

164
0:06:30.903,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?

165
0:06:32.696,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?

166
0:06:35.225,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

167
0:06:36.55,000 --> 0:06:38,000
J: That's pretty good. AR: Oh, thanks.

168
0:06:38.94,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

169
0:06:41.226,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently.

170
0:06:44.13,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top.

171
0:06:46.504,000 --> 0:06:47,000
If you're watching this little token,

172
0:06:48.3,000 --> 0:06:5,000
this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.

173
0:06:51.272,000 --> 0:06:53,000
If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.

174
0:06:54.073,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's not back on your shoulder.

175
0:06:55.673,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.

176
0:06:58.269,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Did you see it go?

177
0:07:00.276,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy. He's union, works up there all day.

178
0:07:03.694,000 --> 0:07:06,000
If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.

179
0:07:06.869,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Is it in this pocket, sir?

180
0:07:08.146,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show.

181
0:07:10.623,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Squeaking)

182
0:07:11.717,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's rather strange. They have shots for that.

183
0:07:14.085,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Can I show them? Rather bizarre. Is this yours, sir?

184
0:07:16.6,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there.

185
0:07:19.677,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I need help with this one.

186
0:07:21.074,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Step over this way for me.

187
0:07:22.367,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket.

188
0:07:25.239,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I was checking mine. I couldn't find everything,

189
0:07:27.516,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but I noticed you had something here.

190
0:07:29.314,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Can I feel the outside for a moment?

191
0:07:31.212,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Down here I noticed this. Is this something of yours, sir?

192
0:07:34.45,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I have no idea. That's a shrimp.

193
0:07:36.034,000 --> 0:07:38,000
J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

194
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way,

195
0:07:41.208,000 --> 0:07:42,000
better than you know.

196
0:07:42.382,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.

197
0:07:45.425,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

198
0:07:46.45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Hopefully it matches his taste.

199
0:07:47.972,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We have a couple of other things,

200
0:07:49.659,000 --> 0:07:5,000
a little bit of cash.

201
0:07:51.373,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we have a few other things,

202
0:07:52.882,000 --> 0:07:53,000
these all belong to you,

203
0:07:54.072,000 --> 0:07:56,000
along with a big round of applause from all your friends.

204
0:07:56.774,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

205
0:07:57.805,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Joe, thank you very much.

206
0:07:59.035,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Applause)

207
0:08:03.913,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause ends)

208
0:08:05.934,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So, same question I asked you before,

209
0:08:08.608,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but this time you don't have to close your eyes.

210
0:08:11.866,000 --> 0:08:12,000
What am I wearing?

211
0:08:13.611,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Audience: Oh!

212
0:08:14.786,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

213
0:08:16.739,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Hesitant applause)

214
0:08:21.522,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Applause ends)

215
0:08:22.974,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Attention is a powerful thing.

216
0:08:24.899,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Like I said, it shapes your reality.

217
0:08:27.86,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.

218
0:08:30.319,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If you could control somebody's attention,

219
0:08:32.485,000 --> 0:08:33,000
what would you do with it?

220
0:08:34.6,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Thank you.

221
0:08:35.783,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

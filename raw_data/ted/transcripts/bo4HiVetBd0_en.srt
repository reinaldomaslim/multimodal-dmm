1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I want to share with you

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
some ideas about the secret power of time,

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in a very short time.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
15 seconds studio.

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
10, nine, eight, seven,

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
six, five, four, three, two ...

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation

11
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of the principals in Adam's temptation.

12
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."

13
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."

14
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"I don't know, guys.

15
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I don't want to get in trouble."

16
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"

17
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,

19
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,

20
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
present focus and future focus.

21
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --

23
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
thank you George Bush --

24
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.

25
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And most of them did so without using birth control.

26
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So much for promises.

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.

28
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait

29
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.

30
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.

31
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.

32
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.

33
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.

34
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,

35
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
went back 14 years later,

36
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to try to discover what was different about those kids.

37
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted

38
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and kids who yielded, in many ways.

39
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.

40
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.

41
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.

42
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,

43
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the key for you,

44
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.

45
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.

46
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Time perspective is the study of how individuals,

47
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience

48
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
into time zones or time categories.

49
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.

50
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They vary between cultures, between nations,

51
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
between individuals, between social classes,

52
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
between education levels.

53
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And the problem is that they can become biased,

54
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.

55
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
What determines any decision you make?

56
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.

57
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,

58
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.

59
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --

60
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we're going to call them "present-oriented,"

61
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because their focus is what is now.

62
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
For others, the present is irrelevant.

63
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"

64
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So that their decisions are based on past memories.

65
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.

66
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
For others it's not the past, it's not the present,

67
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it's only about the future.

68
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.

69
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Cost-benefit analysis.

70
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.

71
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, time paradox, I want to argue,

72
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the paradox of time perspective,

73
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is something that influences every decision you make,

74
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you're totally unaware of.

75
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these

76
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
biased time perspectives.

77
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.

78
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.

79
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.

80
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You can be present-hedonistic,

81
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --

82
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.

83
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.

84
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Or you can be transcendental future:

85
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
namely, life begins after death.

86
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly

87
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
depending on the demands of the situation,

88
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that's what you've got to learn to do.

89
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?

90
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.

91
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And moderate on present-hedonism.

92
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And always low on past-negative

93
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and present-fatalism.

94
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --

95
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.

96
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What you get from the future is wings

97
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to soar to new destinations, new challenges.

98
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What you get from the present hedonism

99
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,

100
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
places, people, sensuality.

101
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.

102
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What do futures sacrifice for success?

103
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.

104
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.

105
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.

106
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And they live for work, achievement and control.

107
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.

108
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,

110
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.

111
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm here as a future-oriented person

112
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices

113
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.

114
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Told me don't eat that marshmallow,

115
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,

116
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
until I learned to balance out.

117
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,

118
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,

119
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I'm happier than I have ever been.

120
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:

121
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
changing the drop-out rates of school kids,

122
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
combating addictions, enhancing teen health,

123
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --

124
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
promoting sustainability and conservation,

125
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,

126
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,

127
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.

128
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I want to end by saying:

129
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
many of life's puzzles can be solved

130
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.

131
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the idea is so simple, so obvious,

132
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but I think the consequences are really profound.

133
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Thank you so much.

134
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Applause)

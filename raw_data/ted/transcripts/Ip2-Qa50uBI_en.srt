1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The first half of the 20th century

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
was an absolute disaster in human affairs,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a cataclysm.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We had the First World War,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the Great Depression,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the Second World War

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and the rise of the communist nations.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And each one of these forces

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
split the world, tore the world apart,

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
divided the world.

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And they threw up walls --

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
political walls, trade walls,

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
transportation walls,

14
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
communication walls, iron curtains --

15
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which divided peoples and nations.

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was only in the second half of the 20th century

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that we slowly began to pull ourselves

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
out of this abyss.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Trade walls began to come tumbling down.

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Here are some data on tariffs:

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We globalized the world. And what does that mean?

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It means that we extended cooperation

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
across national boundaries;

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we made the world more cooperative.

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Transportation walls came tumbling down.

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;

30
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it can be manned with a smaller crew;

31
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and unloaded faster than ever before.

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --

33
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
have come tumbling down.

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And of course the iron curtains,

35
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
political walls have come tumbling down.

36
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.

37
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Trade has increased.

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Here is just a little bit of data.

39
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In 1990, exports from China to the United States:

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
15 billion dollars.

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And perhaps most remarkably,

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
at the beginning of the 21st century,

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
really for the first time in modern history,

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
growth extended to almost all parts of the world.

46
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So China, I've already mentioned,

47
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,

48
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
growth -- ten percent a year.

49
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Year after year after year,

50
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
absolutely incredible.

51
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Never before in human history

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
have so many people been raised out of

53
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
such great poverty as happened in China.

54
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program

55
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
over the last three decades.

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
India, starting a little bit later,

57
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.

58
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Incomes at that time

59
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
less than $1,000 per year.

60
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And over the next 18 years

61
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
have almost tripled.

62
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.

63
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --

64
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Sub-Saharan Africa

65
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
has been the area of the world

66
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
most resistant to growth.

67
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And we can see the tragedy of Africa

68
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in the first few bars here.

69
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Growth was negative.

70
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People were actually getting poorer than their parents,

71
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.

72
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But at the end of the 20th century,

73
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the beginning of the 21st century,

74
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we saw growth in Africa.

75
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,

76
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because I believe that the best is yet to come.

77
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now why.

78
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
On the cutting edge today

79
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's new ideas which are driving growth.

80
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And by that I mean it's

81
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
products for which the research and development costs

82
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.

83
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
More than ever before it is these types of ideas

84
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which are driving growth on the cutting edge.

85
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now ideas have this amazing property.

86
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.

87
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
He said, "He who receives an idea from me

88
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.

89
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
As he who lights his candle at mine

90
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
receives light without darkening me."

91
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Or to put it slightly differently:

92
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
one apple feeds one man,

93
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but an idea can feed the world.

94
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.

95
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is practically the model of TED.

96
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas

97
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is going to drive growth even more than ever before.

98
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This provides a reason why

99
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
trade and globalization

100
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are even more important, more powerful than ever before,

101
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and are going to increase growth more than ever before.

102
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And to explain why this is so, I have a question.

103
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Suppose that there are two diseases:

104
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
one of them is rare, the other one is common,

105
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but if they are not treated they are equally severe.

106
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
If you had to choose, which would you rather have:

107
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the common disease or the rare disease?

108
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,

109
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases

110
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
than there are to treat rare diseases.

111
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The reason for this is incentives.

112
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It costs about the same to produce a new drug

113
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
whether that drug treats 1,000 people,

114
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
100,000 people, or a million people.

115
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.

116
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So the incentives are much larger

117
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to produce drugs which treat more people.

118
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
To put this differently: larger markets save lives.

119
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In this case misery truly does love company.

120
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now think about the following:

121
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,

122
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.

123
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.

124
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
As other countries become richer

125
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
the demand for these pharmaceuticals

126
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is going to increase tremendously.

127
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,

128
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which benefits everyone in the world.

129
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Larger markets increase the incentive

130
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to produce all kinds of ideas,

131
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,

132
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
whether it's a new design.

133
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
For the Hollywood people in the audience,

134
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
this even explains why action movies

135
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
have larger budgets than comedies:

136
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
it's because action movies translate easier

137
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
into other languages and other cultures,

138
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so the market for those movies is larger.

139
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
People are willing to invest more,

140
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and the budgets are larger.

141
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive

142
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to produce new ideas,

143
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
how do we maximize that incentive?

144
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.

145
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The way I like to put this is:

146
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,

147
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so one idea can serve one world, one market.

148
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
One idea, one world, one market.

149
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Well how else can we create new ideas?

150
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That's one reason.

151
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Globalize trade.

152
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
How else can we create new ideas?

153
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Well, more idea creators.

154
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.

155
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.

156
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers

157
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.

158
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent

159
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of the world's population are scientists and engineers.

160
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The United States has been an idea leader.

162
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
A large fraction of those people are in the United States.

163
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.

164
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And for that I am very grateful.

165
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That is a good thing.

166
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader

167
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because for too long the United States,

168
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and a handful of other developed countries,

169
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
have shouldered the entire burden

170
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of research and development.

171
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But consider the following:

172
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now

173
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers

174
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
contributing to ideas which benefit everyone,

175
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
which are shared by everyone.

176
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.

177
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How many Ramanujans are there in India today

178
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,

179
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
when they could be feeding the world?

180
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now we're not there yet.

181
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But it is going to happen in this century.

182
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The real tragedy of the last century is this:

183
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
if you think about the world's population

184
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,

185
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
then the great tragedy has been

186
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that billions of our processors have been off line.

187
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But in this century China is coming on line.

188
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
India is coming on line.

189
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Africa is coming on line.

190
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.

191
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Here is just some data. This is China.

192
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
1996: less than one million

193
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
new university students in China per year;

194
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
2006: over five million.

195
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now think what this means.

196
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.

197
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.

198
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That is something that we should embrace --

199
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.

200
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We need a greater demand for ideas --

201
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
those larger markets I was talking about earlier --

202
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and a greater supply of ideas for the world.

203
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.

204
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Globalization is increasing the demand

205
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.

206
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.

207
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
In fact if you look at world history

208
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
you can see some reasons for optimism.

209
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
From about the beginnings of humanity

210
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.

211
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,

212
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but less in a century

213
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
than you expect to see in a year today.

214
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
1900s: maybe one percent.

215
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.

216
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.

217
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Even at that rate,

218
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
by 2100 average GDP per capita

219
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in the world will be $200,000.

220
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,

221
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.

222
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That's not that far.

223
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We won't make it.

224
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But some of our grandchildren probably will.

225
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I should say,

226
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I think this is a rather modest prediction.

227
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.

228
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.

229
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Alright what about problems?

231
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
What about a great depression?

232
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.

233
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here is GDP per capita

234
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
from 1900 to 1929.

235
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,

236
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
trying to forecast future growth for the United States,

237
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,

238
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
not knowing that we were about to enter

239
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.

240
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What would you have predicted, not knowing this?

241
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
If you had based your prediction, your forecast

242
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
on 1900 to 1929

243
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you'd have predicted something like this.

244
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
If you'd been a little more optimistic --

245
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.

246
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So what actually happened?

247
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We went off a cliff but we recovered.

248
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In fact in the second half of the 20th century

249
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted

250
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
based upon the first half of the 20th century.

251
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So growth can wash away

252
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
even what appears to be a great depression.

253
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Alright. What else?

254
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.

255
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.

256
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So people were asking a question. They were saying,

257
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"Is China drinking our milkshake?"

258
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Laughter)

259
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And there is some truth to this,

260
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,

261
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.

262
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But I think I don't have to tell this audience

263
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.

264
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Moreover, as everyone knows,

265
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.

266
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And higher oil prices mean

267
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
a greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.

268
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You can see this in the data.

269
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.

270
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The world is much better equipped

271
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to overcome an increase in the price of oil

272
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
today, than ever in the past,

273
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because of what I'm talking about.

274
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
One idea, one world, one market.

275
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So I'm optimistic

276
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
so long as we hew to these two ideas:

277
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to keep globalizing world markets,

278
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,

279
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and keep investing in education.

280
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now the United States has a particularly important role

281
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to play in this:

282
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to keep our education system globalized,

283
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,

284
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because our education system

285
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is the candle

286
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that other students come to light their own candles.

287
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now remember here what Jefferson said.

288
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Jefferson said, "When they come

289
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and light their candles at ours,

290
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
they gain light, and we are not darkened."

291
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?

292
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Because the truth is,

293
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
when they light their candles at ours,

294
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
there is twice as much light available for everyone.

295
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So my view is: Be optimistic.

296
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.

297
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Thank you.

298
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

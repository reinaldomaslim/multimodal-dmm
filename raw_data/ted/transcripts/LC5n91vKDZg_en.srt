1
0:00:13.334,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the summer of 2017,

2
0:00:16.402,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a woman was murdered by her partner in Sofia.

3
0:00:20.673,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The woman, let's call her "V,"

4
0:00:23.825,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was beaten for over 50 minutes

5
0:00:27.144,000 --> 0:00:28,000
before she died.

6
0:00:29.479,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The morning after,

7
0:00:31.218,000 --> 0:00:34,000
her neighbors told the press that they heard her screams,

8
0:00:34.94,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but they didn't intervene.

9
0:00:37.772,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You see, in Bulgaria and many other societies,

10
0:00:41.751,000 --> 0:00:44,000
domestic violence is typically seen as a private matter.

11
0:00:46.026,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Neighbors, however, are quick to react to any other kind of noise.

12
0:00:52.404,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We wanted to expose and affect the absurdity of this.

13
0:00:56.889,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So we designed an experiment.

14
0:01:00.224,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We rented the apartment just below V's for one night.

15
0:01:05.017,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And at 10pm,

16
0:01:06.612,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Maksim, the artist in our group,

17
0:01:09.461,000 --> 0:01:12,000
sat on the drum set we had assembled in the living room

18
0:01:14.44,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and started beating it.

19
0:01:17.418,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Ten seconds.

20
0:01:19.91,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Thirty seconds.

21
0:01:22.289,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Fifty seconds.

22
0:01:24.923,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A minute.

23
0:01:27.095,000 --> 0:01:29,000
A light came on in the hallway.

24
0:01:30.353,000 --> 0:01:31,000
One minute and 20 seconds.

25
0:01:33.295,000 --> 0:01:36,000
A man was standing at the door, hesitant to press the bell.

26
0:01:38.032,000 --> 0:01:4,000
One minute and 52 seconds.

27
0:01:41.148,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The doorbell rang,

28
0:01:43.997,000 --> 0:01:45,000
a ring that could have saved a life.

29
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"Beat." is our project exploring the ominous silence

30
0:01:51.842,000 --> 0:01:53,000
surrounding domestic violence.

31
0:01:54.109,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We filmed the experiment, and it became instantly viral.

32
0:01:57.73,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Our campaign amplified the voices of survivors

33
0:02:00.056,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who shared similar stories online.

34
0:02:02.674,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It equipped neighbors with specific advice,

35
0:02:04.813,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and many committed to taking action.

36
0:02:07.629,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In a country where every other week,

37
0:02:10.388,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the ground quietly embraces the body of a woman

38
0:02:13.399,000 --> 0:02:15,000
murdered by a partner or a relative,

39
0:02:16.208,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we were loud,

40
0:02:18.033,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we were heard.

41
0:02:22.627,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I am an activist,

42
0:02:24.741,000 --> 0:02:26,000
passionate about human rights innovation.

43
0:02:27.958,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I lead a global organization for socially engaged creative solutions.

44
0:02:31.909,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In my work, I think about how to make people care and act.

45
0:02:37.789,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I am here to tell you that creative actions can save the world,

46
0:02:42.981,000 --> 0:02:44,000
creative actions and play.

47
0:02:46.576,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I know it is weird to talk about play and human rights in the same sentence,

48
0:02:51.747,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but here is why it's important.

49
0:02:55.038,000 --> 0:02:58,000
More and more, we fear that we can't win this.

50
0:02:59.495,000 --> 0:03:,000
Campaigns feel dull,

51
0:03:01.286,000 --> 0:03:02,000
messages drown,

52
0:03:03.267,000 --> 0:03:04,000
people break.

53
0:03:06.082,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Numerous studies, including a recent one published by Columbia University,

54
0:03:10.079,000 --> 0:03:13,000
show that burnout and depression are widespread amongst activists.

55
0:03:14.417,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Years ago, I myself was burned out.

56
0:03:17.183,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In a world of endless ways forward, I felt at my final stop.

57
0:03:22.605,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So what melts fear or dullness or gloom?

58
0:03:27.793,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Play.

59
0:03:29.469,000 --> 0:03:33,000
From this very stage, psychiatrist and play researcher Dr. Stuart Brown

60
0:03:33.754,000 --> 0:03:35,000
said that nothing lights up the brain like play,

61
0:03:37.582,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and that the opposite of play is not work,

62
0:03:39.77,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it's depression.

63
0:03:41.729,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So to pull out of my own burnout,

64
0:03:44.124,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I decided to turn my activism into what I call today "play-tivism."

65
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:52.339,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When we play, others want to join.

67
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Today, my playground is filled with artists,

68
0:03:58.735,000 --> 0:03:59,000
techies and scientists.

69
0:04:00.846,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We fuse disciplines in radical collaboration.

70
0:04:04.658,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Together, we seek new ways to empower activism.

71
0:04:08.346,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Our outcomes are not meant to be playful,

72
0:04:11.056,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but our process is.

73
0:04:13.832,000 --> 0:04:16,000
To us, play is an act of resistance.

74
0:04:18.197,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For example, "Beat.," the project I talked about earlier,

75
0:04:22.68,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is a concept developed by a drummer and a software engineer

76
0:04:26.926,000 --> 0:04:29,000
who didn't know each other two days before they pitched the idea.

77
0:04:31.165,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Beat." is the first winner in our lab series

78
0:04:33.85,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where we pair artists and technologists to work on human rights issues.

79
0:04:38.775,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Other winning concepts include a pop-up bakery

80
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that teaches about fake news through beautiful but horrible-tasting cupcakes --

81
0:04:46.533,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:49.411,000 --> 0:04:52,000
or a board game that puts you in the shoes of a dictator

83
0:04:53.301,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so you get to really grasp the range of tools and tactics of oppression.

84
0:04:59.382,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We did our first lab just to test the idea,

85
0:05:02.669,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to see where it cracks and if we can make it better.

86
0:05:05.45,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Today, we are so in love with the format that we put it all online

87
0:05:08.728,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for anyone to implement.

88
0:05:11.148,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I cannot overstate the value of experimentation in activism.

89
0:05:15.312,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We can only win if we are not afraid to lose.

90
0:05:20.247,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When we play, we learn.

91
0:05:24.332,000 --> 0:05:26,000
A recent study published by Stanford University

92
0:05:26.995,000 --> 0:05:28,000
about the science of what makes people care

93
0:05:29.089,000 --> 0:05:32,000
reconfirms what we have been hearing for years:

94
0:05:32.293,000 --> 0:05:34,000
opinions are changed not from more information

95
0:05:34.982,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but through empathy-inducing experiences.

96
0:05:38.02,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So learning from science and art,

97
0:05:40.842,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we saw that we can talk about global armed conflict through light bulbs,

98
0:05:46.144,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or address racial inequality in the US

99
0:05:49.025,000 --> 0:05:5,000
through postcards,

100
0:05:51.32,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or tackle the lack of even one single monument of a woman in Sofia

101
0:05:55.941,000 --> 0:05:57,000
by flooding the city with them,

102
0:05:58.655,000 --> 0:06:,000
and, with all these works,

103
0:06:00.859,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to trigger dialogue, understanding and direct action.

104
0:06:06.534,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Sometimes, when I talk about taking risks and trying and failing

105
0:06:10.819,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in the context of human rights,

106
0:06:12.614,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I meet raised eyebrows,

107
0:06:15.639,000 --> 0:06:18,000
eyebrows that say, "How irresponsible,"

108
0:06:18.896,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or, "How insensitive."

109
0:06:21.567,000 --> 0:06:24,000
People often mistake play for negligence.

110
0:06:25.318,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It is not.

111
0:06:28.218,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Play doesn't just grow our armies stronger or spark better ideas.

112
0:06:33.741,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In times of painful injustice,

113
0:06:36.196,000 --> 0:06:39,000
play brings the levity we need to be able to breathe.

114
0:06:39.85,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When we play, we live.

115
0:06:45.907,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I grew up in a time

116
0:06:48.232,000 --> 0:06:49,000
when all play was forbidden.

117
0:06:51.387,000 --> 0:06:54,000
My family's lives were crushed by a communist dictatorship.

118
0:06:55.923,000 --> 0:06:58,000
For my aunt, my grandfather, my father,

119
0:06:59.744,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we always held two funerals:

120
0:07:02.241,000 --> 0:07:03,000
one for their bodies,

121
0:07:03.641,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but, years before that,

122
0:07:05.208,000 --> 0:07:06,000
one for their dreams.

123
0:07:07.657,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Some of my biggest dreams are nightmares.

124
0:07:12.685,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I have a nightmare that one day all the past will be forgotten

125
0:07:16.983,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and new clothes will be dripping the blood of past mistakes.

126
0:07:21.546,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I have a nightmare

127
0:07:23.545,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that one day the lighthouses of our humanity will crumble,

128
0:07:27.049,000 --> 0:07:29,000
corroded by acid waves of hate.

129
0:07:30.301,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But way more than that,

130
0:07:32.932,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I have hope.

131
0:07:35.169,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In our fights for justice and freedom,

132
0:07:37.509,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I hope that we play,

133
0:07:40.205,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and that we see the joy and beauty of us playing together.

134
0:07:45.626,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That's how we win.

135
0:07:48.058,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Thank you.

136
0:07:49.858,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Applause)

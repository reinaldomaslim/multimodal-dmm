1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here to share my photography.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Or is it photography?

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Because, of course, this is a photograph

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that you can't take with your camera.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Yet, my interest in photography started

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as I got my first digital camera

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
at the age of 15.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but it was a bit different,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because using the camera,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the process was in the planning instead.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And when you take a photograph with a camera,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the process ends when you press the trigger.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So to me it felt like photography was more about

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
being at the right place and the right time.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I felt like anyone could do that.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I wanted to create something different,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
something where the process starts

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when you press the trigger.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Photos like this:

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
construction going on along a busy road.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But it has an unexpected twist.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And despite that,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
it retains a level of realism.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Or photos like these --

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
both dark and colorful,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but all with a common goal

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of retaining the level of realism.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
When I say realism,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I mean photo-realism.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Because, of course,

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it's not something you can capture really,

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as a photograph.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to figure out the trick.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So it's more about capturing an idea

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
than about capturing a moment really.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But what's the trick

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that makes it look realistic?

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Is it something about the details

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or the colors?

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Is it something about the light?

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What creates the illusion?

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's not really what is realistic,

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it's what we think looks realistic really.

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I think the basics

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are quite simple.

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I just see it as a puzzle of reality

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to create alternate reality.

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And let me show you a simple example.

56
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But combined in a certain way,

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
like it could exist.

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But at the same time, we know it can't.

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So we trick our brains,

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that it doesn't really make sense.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And I see the same process

66
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
with combining photographs.

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's just really about combining different realities.

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I think it's the things that we don't even think about,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the things all around us in our daily lives.

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But when combining photographs,

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
this is really important to consider,

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to achieve a realistic result.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
As you can see, these images aren't really special.

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But combined, they can create something like this.

78
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So the first rule is that photos combined

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
should have the same perspective.

80
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Secondly, photos combined

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
should have the same type of light.

82
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --

83
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
shot at the same height and in the same type of light.

84
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish

85
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
where the different images begin and end

86
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
by making it seamless.

87
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Make it impossible to say

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
how the image actually was composed.

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So by matching color, contrast and brightness

90
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the borders between the different images,

91
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
adding photographic defects

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
like depth of field,

93
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
desaturated colors and noise,

94
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we erase the borders between the different images

95
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and make it look like one single image,

96
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
despite the fact that one image

97
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
can contain hundreds of layers basically.

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So here's another example.

99
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape

101
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the lower part is what's manipulated.

102
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But this image is actually entirely composed

103
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of photographs from different locations.

104
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place

105
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
than to find a place,

106
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because then you don't need to compromise

107
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with the ideas in your head.

108
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But it does require a lot of planning.

109
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And getting this idea during winter,

110
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I knew that I had several months to plan it,

111
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to find the different locations

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
for the pieces of the puzzle basically.

113
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So for example,

114
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the fish was captured on a fishing trip.

115
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The shores are from a different location.

116
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.

117
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red

118
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to make it look more Swedish.

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So to achieve a realistic result,

120
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I think it comes down to planning.

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.

122
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Then it's about combining the different photographs.

123
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And here every piece is very well planned.

124
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,

125
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the result can be quite beautiful

126
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and also quite realistic.

127
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So all the tools are out there,

128
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the only thing that limits us

129
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is our imagination.

130
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Thank you.

131
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.457,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Our world has many superheroes.

2
0:00:16.454,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But they have the worst of all superpowers: invisibility.

3
0:00:22.012,000 --> 0:00:24,000
For example, the catadores,

4
0:00:24.349,000 --> 0:00:28,000
workers who collect recyclable materials for a living.

5
0:00:28.462,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Catadores emerged from social inequality, unemployment,

6
0:00:33.122,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the abundance of solid waste

7
0:00:36.141,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from the deficiency of the waste collection system.

8
0:00:40.74,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Catadores provide a heavy, honest and essential work

9
0:00:46.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that benefits the entire population. But they are not acknowledged for it.

10
0:00:51.441,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent of all the waste that's actually recycled.

11
0:00:59.442,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Most of the catadores work independently,

12
0:01:02.164,000 --> 0:01:07,000
picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices.

13
0:01:07.575,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They may collect over 300 kilos

14
0:01:10.97,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in their bags, shopping carts, bicycles and carroças.

15
0:01:16.505,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Carroças are carts built from wood or metal

16
0:01:19.351,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and found in several streets in Brazil,

17
0:01:22.169,000 --> 0:01:24,000
much like graffiti and street art.

18
0:01:24.792,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes.

19
0:01:29.743,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I am a graffiti artist and activist

20
0:01:32.023,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and my art is social, environmental and political in nature.

21
0:01:38.208,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In 2007, I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças,

22
0:01:43.37,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as a new urban support for my message.

23
0:01:46.324,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But at this time, giving voice to the catadores.

24
0:01:50.141,000 --> 0:01:55,000
By adding art and humor to the cause, it became more appealing,

25
0:01:55.482,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which helped call attention to the catadores

26
0:01:58.05,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and improve their self-esteem.

27
0:01:59.975,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And also, they are famous now on the streets, on mass media and social.

28
0:02:05.256,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So, the thing is,

29
0:02:07.945,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since.

30
0:02:11.902,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities

31
0:02:15.336,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide.

32
0:02:19.301,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And then I realized that catadores, in their invisibility,

33
0:02:23.953,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are not exclusive to Brazil.

34
0:02:25.981,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I met them in Argentina, Chile,

35
0:02:30.505,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey

36
0:02:35.079,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan.

37
0:02:40.104,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause

38
0:02:44.82,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because it's a big challenge.

39
0:02:46.653,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And then, I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça --

40
0:02:52.455,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter) -- which is a large crowdfunded event.

41
0:02:56.142,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Thank you.

42
0:02:57.169,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause).

43
0:03:00.868,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event

44
0:03:04.84,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to help catadores and their carroças.

45
0:03:07.576,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare,

46
0:03:11.635,000 --> 0:03:17,000
like physicians, dentists, podiatrists, hair stylists, massage therapists

47
0:03:18.393,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and much more.

48
0:03:19.698,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But also, they also receive safety shirts, gloves, raincoats and eyeglasses

49
0:03:24.667,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to see in high-definition the city,

50
0:03:26.762,000 --> 0:03:31,000
while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers.

51
0:03:31.78,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And then they receive safety items, too:

52
0:03:34.189,000 --> 0:03:36,000
reflective tapes, horns and mirrors.

53
0:03:36.554,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Then, finally, painted by a street artist

54
0:03:39.119,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and become part of part of this huge, amazing mobile art exhibition.

55
0:03:44.42,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.

56
0:03:50.208,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But to meet the demand in other cities, including outside of Brazil,

57
0:03:54.907,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we have created Pimpx, which is inspired by TEDx,

58
0:04:00.092,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself, crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.

59
0:04:06.026,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So now everybody can join.

60
0:04:09.016,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists

61
0:04:17.15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and more than 1,000 donors

62
0:04:19.126,000 --> 0:04:21,000
have been involved in the Pimp My Carroça movement,

63
0:04:22.001,000 --> 0:04:26,000
whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school.

64
0:04:28.095,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So catadores are leaving invisibility behind

65
0:04:32.108,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and becoming increasingly respected and valued.

66
0:04:35.662,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because of their pimped carroças, they are able to fight back to prejudice,

67
0:04:40.219,000 --> 0:04:43,000
increase their income and their interaction with society.

68
0:04:44.121,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So now, I'd like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging

69
0:04:49.043,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city.

70
0:04:53.065,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Try to see the world as one, without boundaries or frontiers.

71
0:04:58.134,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Believe it or not,

72
0:04:59.764,000 --> 0:05:05,000
there are over 20 million catadores worldwide.

73
0:05:05.785,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So next time you see one,

74
0:05:08.405,000 --> 0:05:12,000
recognize them as a vital part of our society.

75
0:05:13.066,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Muito obrigado, thank you.

76
0:05:15.71,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause).

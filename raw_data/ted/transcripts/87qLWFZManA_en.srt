1
0:00:12.902,000 --> 0:00:13,000
My name is Hannah.

2
0:00:14.554,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And that is a palindrome.

3
0:00:17.14,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That is a word you can spell the same forwards and backwards,

4
0:00:23.944,000 --> 0:00:24,000
if you can spell.

5
0:00:25.453,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But the thing is --

6
0:00:26.779,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.112,000 --> 0:00:31,000
my entire family have palindromic names.

8
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's a bit of a tradition.

9
0:00:33.152,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We've got Mum, Dad --

10
0:00:36.289,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:38.328,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Nan, Pop.

12
0:00:40.562,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:43.447,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And my brother, Kayak.

14
0:00:45.836,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:47.3,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There you go.

16
0:00:48.609,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's just a bit a joke, there.

17
0:00:50.769,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:51.902,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I like to kick things off with a joke because I'm a comedian.

19
0:00:55.353,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now there's two things you know about me already:

20
0:00:57.758,000 --> 0:00:58,000
my name's Hannah and I'm a comedian.

21
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm wasting no time.

22
0:01:00.965,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Here's a third thing you can know about me:

23
0:01:03.433,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I don't think I'm qualified to speak my own mind.

24
0:01:07.428,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Bold way to begin a talk, yes,

25
0:01:10.011,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but it's true.

26
0:01:11.726,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I've always had a great deal of difficulty

27
0:01:14.009,000 --> 0:01:16,000
turning my thinking into the talking.

28
0:01:17.628,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So it seems a bit of a contradiction, then,

29
0:01:19.733,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that someone like me, who is so bad at the chat,

30
0:01:22.178,000 --> 0:01:24,000
could be something like a stand-up comedian.

31
0:01:25.373,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But there you go. There you go.

32
0:01:27.304,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's what it is.

33
0:01:28.988,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I first tried my hand at stand-up comedi -- comedie ... See?

34
0:01:33.011,000 --> 0:01:34,000
See? See?

35
0:01:34.198,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:37.052,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I first tried my hand at stand-up comedy

37
0:01:40.013,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in my late 20s,

38
0:01:41.204,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and despite being a pathologically shy virtual mute with low self-esteem

39
0:01:46.616,000 --> 0:01:48,000
who'd never held a microphone before,

40
0:01:48.71,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I knew as soon as I walked and stood in front of the audience,

41
0:01:53.534,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I knew, before I'd even landed my first joke,

42
0:01:56.513,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I knew that I really liked stand-up,

43
0:01:59.561,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and stand-up really liked me.

44
0:02:02.123,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But for the life of me, I couldn't work out why.

45
0:02:05.594,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Why is it I could be so good at doing something I was so bad at?

46
0:02:10.853,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:12.064,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I just couldn't work it out, I could not understand it.

48
0:02:15.098,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That is, until I could.

49
0:02:17.081,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, before I explain to you why it is

50
0:02:19.976,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that I can be good at something I'm so bad at,

51
0:02:23.256,000 --> 0:02:25,000
let me throw another spanner of contradiction into the work

52
0:02:26.127,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by telling you that not long after I worked out why that was,

53
0:02:30.431,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I decided to quit comedy.

54
0:02:33.009,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And before I explain that little oppositional cat

55
0:02:35.765,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I just threw amongst the thinking pigeons,

56
0:02:38.491,000 --> 0:02:4,000
let me also tell you this:

57
0:02:41.084,000 --> 0:02:43,000
quitting launched my comedy career.

58
0:02:43.961,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:45.943,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Like, really launched it, to the point where after quitting comedy,

60
0:02:50.038,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I became the most talked-about comedian on the planet,

61
0:02:52.996,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because apparently, I'm even worse at making retirement plans

62
0:02:56.648,000 --> 0:02:58,000
than I am at speaking my own mind.

63
0:03:00.568,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, all I've done up until this point

64
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:07,000
apart from giving over a spattering of biographical detail

65
0:03:08.171,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is to tell you indirectly that I have three ideas

66
0:03:10.502,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that I want to share with you today.

67
0:03:12.282,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I've done that by way of sharing three contradictions:

68
0:03:15.726,000 --> 0:03:18,000
one, I am bad at talking, I am good at talking;

69
0:03:18.951,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I quit, I did not quit.

70
0:03:21.718,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Three ideas, three contradictions.

71
0:03:23.579,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, if you're wondering why there's only two things

72
0:03:26.084,000 --> 0:03:27,000
on my so-called list of three --

73
0:03:27.635,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:28.693,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I remind you it is literally a list of contradictions.

75
0:03:31.242,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Keep up.

76
0:03:32.429,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:34.977,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, the folks at TED advised me that with a talk of this length,

78
0:03:39.482,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it's best to stick with just sharing one idea.

79
0:03:42.958,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I said no.

80
0:03:44.453,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:47.943,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What would they know?

82
0:03:49.737,000 --> 0:03:54,000
To explain why I have chosen to ignore what is clearly very good advice,

83
0:03:54.815,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I want to take you back to the beginning of this talk,

84
0:03:57.38,000 --> 0:03:58,000
specifically, my palindrome joke.

85
0:03:59.052,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now that joke uses my favorite trick of the comedian trade,

86
0:04:03.188,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the rule of three,

87
0:04:04.381,000 --> 0:04:05,000
whereby you make a statement

88
0:04:05.863,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then back that statement up

89
0:04:07.407,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with a list.

90
0:04:08.589,000 --> 0:04:1,000
My entire family have palindromic names:

91
0:04:11.244,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Mum, Dad, Nan, Pop.

92
0:04:14.243,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The first two ideas on that list create a pattern,

93
0:04:18.207,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and that pattern creates expectation.

94
0:04:20.446,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And then the third thing -- bam! -- Kayak. What?

95
0:04:23.34,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That's the rule of three.

96
0:04:24.694,000 --> 0:04:26,000
One, two, surprise! Ha ha.

97
0:04:27.109,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:32.851,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, the rule of three is not only fundamental to the way I do my craft,

99
0:04:37.718,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it is also fundamental to the way I communicate.

100
0:04:40.399,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I won't be changing anything for nobody,

101
0:04:43.057,000 --> 0:04:44,000
not even TED,

102
0:04:44.237,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which, I will point out, stands for three ideas:

103
0:04:47.515,000 --> 0:04:48,000
technology, entertainment

104
0:04:49.426,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and dickheads.

105
0:04:50.696,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:53.688,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Works every time, doesn't it?

107
0:04:57.713,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But you need more than just jokes

108
0:04:59.789,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to be able to cut it as a professional comedian.

109
0:05:02.171,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You need to be able to walk that fine line between being charming

110
0:05:06.085,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and disarming.

111
0:05:07.617,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I discovered the most effective way to generate the amount of charm I needed

112
0:05:13.014,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to offset my disarming personality

113
0:05:17.535,000 --> 0:05:19,000
was through not jokes but stories.

114
0:05:19.875,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So my stand-up routines are filled with stories:

115
0:05:22.169,000 --> 0:05:24,000
stories about growing up, my coming out story,

116
0:05:24.473,000 --> 0:05:27,000
stories about the abuse I've copped for being not only a woman

117
0:05:27.729,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but a big woman and a masculine-of-center woman.

118
0:05:31.371,000 --> 0:05:34,000
If you watch my work online, check the comments out below

119
0:05:34.655,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for examples of abuse.

120
0:05:37.336,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:39.136,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's that time in the talk where I shift into second gear,

122
0:05:42.423,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and I'm going to tell you a story about everything I've just said.

123
0:05:46.819,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In the last few days of her life,

124
0:05:49.057,000 --> 0:05:51,000
my grandma was surrounded by people,

125
0:05:52.074,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a lot of people,

126
0:05:53.804,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because my grandma was the loving matriarch

127
0:05:56.3,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of a large and loving family.

128
0:05:59.211,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, if you haven't made the connection already,

129
0:06:01.521,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I am a member of that family.

130
0:06:03.854,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I was lucky enough to be able to say goodbye to my grandma

131
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
on the day she died.

132
0:06:08.902,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But as she was already cocooned within herself by then,

133
0:06:11.919,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it was something of a one-sided goodbye.

134
0:06:15.853,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So I thought about a lot of things,

135
0:06:18.81,000 --> 0:06:2,000
things I hadn't thought about in a long time,

136
0:06:21.709,000 --> 0:06:23,000
like the letters I used to write to my grandma

137
0:06:23.941,000 --> 0:06:24,000
when I first started university,

138
0:06:25.823,000 --> 0:06:27,000
letters I filled with funny stories and anecdotes

139
0:06:28.595,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that I embellished for her amusement.

140
0:06:31.022,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I remembered how I couldn't articulate

141
0:06:33.66,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the anxiety and fear that filled me as I tried to carve my tiny little life

142
0:06:39.449,000 --> 0:06:42,000
into a world that felt far too big for me.

143
0:06:43.213,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But I remembered finding comfort in those letters,

144
0:06:46.233,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because I wrote them with my grandma in mind.

145
0:06:50.002,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But as the world got more and more overwhelming

146
0:06:52.757,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and my ability to negotiate it got worse, not better,

147
0:06:56.768,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I stopped writing those letters.

148
0:07:00.041,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I just didn't think I had the life that Grandma would want to read about.

149
0:07:06.162,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Grandma did not know I was gay,

150
0:07:08.533,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and about six months before she died,

151
0:07:10.507,000 --> 0:07:12,000
out of nowhere, she asked me if I had a boyfriend.

152
0:07:14.139,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, I remember making a conscious decision in that moment

153
0:07:17.74,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not to come out to my grandmother.

154
0:07:20.881,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And I did that because I knew her life was drawing to an end,

155
0:07:24.232,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and my time with her was finite,

156
0:07:25.928,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I did not want to talk about the ways we were different.

157
0:07:28.763,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I wanted to talk about the ways were we connected.

158
0:07:32.595,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So I changed the subject.

159
0:07:35.061,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And at the time, it felt like the right decision.

160
0:07:38.374,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But as I sat witness to my grandmother's life

161
0:07:41.162,000 --> 0:07:43,000
as it tapered to its inevitable end,

162
0:07:43.678,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I couldn't help but feel I'd made a mistake

163
0:07:46.095,000 --> 0:07:49,000
not to share such a significant part of my life.

164
0:07:51.248,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But I also knew that I'd missed my opportunity,

165
0:07:55.129,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and as Grandma always used to say,

166
0:07:57.226,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"Ah, well, it's all part of the soup.

167
0:07:59.91,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Too late to take the onions out now."

168
0:08:02.038,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:04.414,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And I thought about that,

170
0:08:05.883,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I thought about how I had to deal with too many onions

171
0:08:09.769,000 --> 0:08:1,000
as a kid,

172
0:08:11.717,000 --> 0:08:15,000
growing up gay in a state where homosexuality was illegal.

173
0:08:16.376,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And with that thought, I could see how tightly wrapped

174
0:08:19.115,000 --> 0:08:22,000
in the tendrils of my own internalized shame I was.

175
0:08:22.952,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And with that, I thought about all my traumas:

176
0:08:25.809,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the violence, the abuse, my rape.

177
0:08:32.087,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And with all that cluster of thinking,

178
0:08:34.355,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a thought, a question, kept popping into my mind

179
0:08:37.522,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to which I had no answer:

180
0:08:39.813,000 --> 0:08:41,000
What is the purpose of my human?

181
0:08:43.743,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Out of anyone in my family, I felt the most akin to my grandmother.

182
0:08:48.154,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I mean, we share the most traits in common.

183
0:08:51.248,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Not so much these days.

184
0:08:52.922,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Death really changes people.

185
0:08:54.584,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But that --

186
0:08:55.768,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:56.855,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is my grandmother's sense of humor.

188
0:08:59.215,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But the person I felt most akin to in the world

189
0:09:01.888,000 --> 0:09:03,000
was a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother,

190
0:09:04.305,000 --> 0:09:05,000
a great-great-grandmother.

191
0:09:05.743,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Me? I represented the very end of my branch of the family tree.

192
0:09:10.277,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I wasn't entirely sure I was still connected to the trunk.

193
0:09:14.242,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What was the purpose of my human?

194
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The year after my grandmother's death was the most intensely creative

195
0:09:22.826,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of my life.

196
0:09:24.01,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And I suppose that's because, at an end, my thoughts gather

197
0:09:27.44,000 --> 0:09:28,000
more than they scatter.

198
0:09:29.466,000 --> 0:09:31,000
My thought process is not linear.

199
0:09:31.75,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm a visual thinker. I see my thoughts.

200
0:09:34.289,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I don't have a photographic memory,

201
0:09:36.072,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and nor is my head a static gallery of sensibly collected think pieces.

202
0:09:42.044,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's more that I've got this ever-evolving language of hieroglyphics

203
0:09:47.031,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that I've developed

204
0:09:48.208,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and can understand fluently and think deeply with.

205
0:09:51.94,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but I struggle to translate.

206
0:09:54.168,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I can't paint, draw, sculpt, or even haberdash,

207
0:09:57.512,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and as for the written word,

208
0:10:00.327,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I'm OK at it but it's a tortuous process of translation,

209
0:10:05.537,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I don't feel it does the job.

210
0:10:08.326,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And as far as speaking my own mind, like I said, I'm not great at it.

211
0:10:12.804,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Speech has always felt like an inadequate freeze-frame

212
0:10:16.004,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for the life inside of me.

213
0:10:18.919,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All this to say,

214
0:10:20.113,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I've always understood far more than I've ever been able to communicate.

215
0:10:25.99,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now, about a year before Grandma died,

216
0:10:28.099,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I was formally diagnosed with autism.

217
0:10:31.165,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Now for me, that was mostly good news.

218
0:10:34.248,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I always thought that I couldn't sort my life out like a normal person

219
0:10:39.015,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because I was depressed and anxious.

220
0:10:41.685,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But it turns out

221
0:10:43.163,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I was depressed and anxious

222
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because I couldn't sort my life out like a normal person,

223
0:10:48.079,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because I was not a normal person,

224
0:10:50.44,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and I didn't know it.

225
0:10:52.203,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now, this is not to say I still don't struggle.

226
0:10:54.436,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Every day is a bit of a struggle,

227
0:10:56.164,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to be honest.

228
0:10:57.347,000 --> 0:11:,000
But at least now I know what my struggle is,

229
0:11:00.389,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and getting to the starting line of normal is not it.

230
0:11:03.867,000 --> 0:11:05,000
My struggle is not to escape the storm.

231
0:11:06.531,000 --> 0:11:11,000
My struggle is to find the eye of the storm as best I can.

232
0:11:11.558,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Now, apart from the usual way us spectrum types find our calm --

233
0:11:16.338,000 --> 0:11:19,000
repetitive behaviors, routine and obsessive thinking --

234
0:11:20.284,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I have another surprising doorway into the eye of the storm:

235
0:11:26.574,000 --> 0:11:27,000
stand-up comedy.

236
0:11:28.334,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And if you need any more proof I'm neurodivergent, yes,

237
0:11:31.987,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I am calm doing a thing that scares the hell out of most people.

238
0:11:36.952,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm almost dead inside up here.

239
0:11:39.249,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:43.072,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Diagnosis gave me a framework on which to hang bits of me

241
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I could never understand.

242
0:11:48.512,000 --> 0:11:5,000
My misfit suddenly had a fit,

243
0:11:50.677,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and for a while, I got giddy with a newfound confidence

244
0:11:53.402,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I had in my thinking.

245
0:11:55.444,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But after Grandma died, that confidence took a dive,

246
0:11:59.636,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because thinking is how I grieve.

247
0:12:03.131,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And in that grief of thought,

248
0:12:04.855,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I could suddenly see with so much clarity

249
0:12:07.968,000 --> 0:12:11,000
just how profoundly isolated I was and always had been.

250
0:12:14.168,000 --> 0:12:17,000
What was the purpose of my human?

251
0:12:18.644,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I began to think a lot about how autism and PTSD have so much in common.

252
0:12:24.719,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I started to worry,

253
0:12:26.381,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because I had both.

254
0:12:28.137,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Could I ever untangle them?

255
0:12:32.499,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I'd always been told that the way out of trauma

256
0:12:34.925,000 --> 0:12:36,000
was through a cohesive narrative.

257
0:12:37.567,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I had a cohesive narrative,

258
0:12:40.188,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but I was still at the mercy of my traumas.

259
0:12:43.301,000 --> 0:12:46,000
They're all part of my soup, but the onions still stung.

260
0:12:47.168,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And at that point, I realized

261
0:12:49.696,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that I'd been telling my stories for laughs.

262
0:12:52.416,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I'd been trimming away the darkness, cutting away the pain

263
0:12:55.278,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and holding on to my trauma for the comfort of my audience.

264
0:13:00.021,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I was connecting other people through laughs,

265
0:13:02.438,000 --> 0:13:05,000
yet I remained profoundly disconnected.

266
0:13:05.725,000 --> 0:13:08,000
What was the purpose of my human?

267
0:13:08.895,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I did not have an answer,

268
0:13:10.657,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but I had an idea.

269
0:13:12.626,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I had an idea to tell my truth,

270
0:13:16.032,000 --> 0:13:17,000
all of it,

271
0:13:17.771,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not to share laughs but to share the literal, visceral pain of my trauma.

272
0:13:23.025,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And I thought the best way to do that would be through a comedy show.

273
0:13:26.356,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And that is what I did.

274
0:13:28.227,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I wrote a comedy show that did not respect the punchline,

275
0:13:31.987,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that line where comedians are expected and trusted to pull their punches

276
0:13:35.711,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and turn them into tickles.

277
0:13:37.29,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I did not stop.

278
0:13:38.499,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I punched through that line

279
0:13:40.143,000 --> 0:13:43,000
into the metaphorical guts of my audience.

280
0:13:43.66,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I did not want to make them laugh.

281
0:13:46.9,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I wanted to take their breath away,

282
0:13:49.062,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to shock them,

283
0:13:50.24,000 --> 0:13:54,000
so they could listen to my story and hold my pain

284
0:13:54.357,000 --> 0:13:58,000
as individuals, not as a mindless, laughing mob.

285
0:13:58.85,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And that's what I did, and I called that show "Nanette."

286
0:14:02.417,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Now, many --

287
0:14:03.798,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

288
0:14:09.615,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, many have argued

289
0:14:11.662,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that "Nanette" is not a comedy show.

290
0:14:14.267,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And while I can agree "Nanette" is definitely not a comedy show,

291
0:14:19.204,000 --> 0:14:2,000
those people are still wrong --

292
0:14:20.946,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Laughter)

293
0:14:22.414,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because they have framed their argument

294
0:14:24.297,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as a way of saying I failed to do comedy.

295
0:14:28.78,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I did not fail to do comedy.

296
0:14:32.381,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I took everything I knew about comedy --

297
0:14:35.683,000 --> 0:14:37,000
all the tricks, the tools, the know-how --

298
0:14:38.571,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I took all that, and with it, I broke comedy.

299
0:14:42.011,000 --> 0:14:44,000
You cannot break comedy with comedy

300
0:14:44.951,000 --> 0:14:46,000
if you fail at comedy.

301
0:14:47.092,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Flaccid be thy hammer.

302
0:14:49.199,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

303
0:14:55.978,000 --> 0:14:56,000
That was not my point.

304
0:14:57.257,000 --> 0:15:,000
The point was not simply to break comedy.

305
0:15:01.913,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The point was to break comedy so I could rebuild it and reshape it,

306
0:15:05.981,000 --> 0:15:08,000
reform it into something that could better hold everything

307
0:15:09.76,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I needed to share,

308
0:15:11.527,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and that is what I meant when I said I quit comedy.

309
0:15:16.919,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Now, it's probably at this point where you're going, "Yeah, cool,

310
0:15:20.032,000 --> 0:15:22,000
but what are the three ideas, exactly?

311
0:15:22.467,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It's a bit vague."

312
0:15:24.389,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I'm glad I pretended you asked.

313
0:15:26.494,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Laughter)

314
0:15:30.876,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Now, I'm sure there's quite a few of you who have already identified three ideas.

315
0:15:36.306,000 --> 0:15:38,000
A smart crowd, by all accounts,

316
0:15:39.032,000 --> 0:15:41,000
so I wouldn't be surprised at all.

317
0:15:41.128,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But you might be surprised to find out that I don't have three ideas.

318
0:15:45.124,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I told you I had three ideas, and that was a lie.

319
0:15:48.735,000 --> 0:15:51,000
That was pure misdirection -- I'm very funny.

320
0:15:51.897,000 --> 0:15:57,000
What I've done instead is I've taken whole handfuls of my ideas as seeds,

321
0:15:58.597,000 --> 0:16:,000
and I've scattered them all throughout my talk.

322
0:16:02.022,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And why did I do that?

323
0:16:03.702,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Well, apart from shits and giggles,

324
0:16:06.53,000 --> 0:16:09,000
it comes down to something my grandma always used to say.

325
0:16:11.386,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"It's not the garden, it's the gardening that counts."

326
0:16:16.347,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And "Nanette" taught me the truth to that truism.

327
0:16:20.13,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I fully expected by breaking the contract of comedy

328
0:16:23.128,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and telling my story in all its truth and pain

329
0:16:28.442,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that that would push me further into the margins of both life and art.

330
0:16:33.771,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I expected that, and I was willing to pay that cost in order to tell my truth.

331
0:16:40.448,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But that is not what happened.

332
0:16:42.606,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The world did not push me away. It pulled me closer.

333
0:16:47.091,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Through an act of disconnection, I found connection.

334
0:16:51.801,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And it took me a long time to understand

335
0:16:53.82,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that what is at the heart of that contradiction

336
0:16:56.341,000 --> 0:16:58,000
is also at the heart of the contradiction

337
0:16:59.261,000 --> 0:17:03,000
as to why I can be so good at something I am so bad at.

338
0:17:05.284,000 --> 0:17:06,000
You see, in the real world,

339
0:17:07.012,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I struggle to talk to people

340
0:17:08.585,000 --> 0:17:14,000
because my neurodiversity makes it difficult for me to think,

341
0:17:16.011,000 --> 0:17:18,000
listen, speak and process new information

342
0:17:18.676,000 --> 0:17:19,000
all at the same time.

343
0:17:20.532,000 --> 0:17:22,000
But onstage, I don't have to think.

344
0:17:22.793,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I prepare my thinks well in advance.

345
0:17:25.694,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I don't have to listen. That is your job.

346
0:17:28.088,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Laughter)

347
0:17:29.622,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And I don't really have to talk,

348
0:17:32.067,000 --> 0:17:34,000
because, strictly speaking, I'm reciting.

349
0:17:35.646,000 --> 0:17:37,000
So all that is left

350
0:17:38.822,000 --> 0:17:4,000
is for me to do my best

351
0:17:41.938,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to make a genuine connection with my audience.

352
0:17:47.761,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And if the experience of "Nanette" taught me anything,

353
0:17:50.918,000 --> 0:17:54,000
it's that connection depends not just on me.

354
0:17:55.921,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You play a part.

355
0:17:59.371,000 --> 0:18:01,000
"Nanette" may have begun in me,

356
0:18:02.072,000 --> 0:18:06,000
but she now lives and grows in a whole world of other minds,

357
0:18:06.376,000 --> 0:18:08,000
minds I do not share.

358
0:18:08.79,000 --> 0:18:1,000
But I trust I am connected.

359
0:18:12.592,000 --> 0:18:15,000
And in that, she is so much bigger than me,

360
0:18:15.907,000 --> 0:18:2,000
just like the purpose of being human is so much bigger than all of us.

361
0:18:21.096,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Make of that what you will.

362
0:18:22.522,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Thank you, and hello.

363
0:18:24.507,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

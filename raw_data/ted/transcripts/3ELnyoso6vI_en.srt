1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.

3
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,

4
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.

6
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about

7
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.

8
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And someone asked,"Why?"

9
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,

10
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
no one really minds what happens to them

11
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."

12
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.

14
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind

15
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in British politics or American politics,

16
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and that is: We have run out of money.

17
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We have vast budget deficits.

18
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is my global public debt clock,

19
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.

20
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I think what this leads to

21
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is a very simple recognition,

22
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,

23
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?

24
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,

25
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things

26
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that politicians talk about.

27
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --

28
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you can only measure success in public services

29
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in health care and education and policing by spending more money,

30
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you can only measure progress by spending money --

31
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you're going to have a pretty miserable time.

32
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --

33
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --

34
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.

35
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,

36
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the really straightforward argument is this:

37
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,

38
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,

39
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that all of you know so much more about than I do,

40
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,

41
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
remake government, remake public services,

42
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.

43
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That's the argument I want to make tonight.

44
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So, starting with the political philosophy.

45
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.

46
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Of course we don't.

47
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy

48
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that are really relevant to this whole debate.

49
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The first is this: We believe that if you give people

50
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
more power and control over their lives,

51
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
if you give people more choice,

52
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
if you put them in the driving seat,

53
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.

54
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance

55
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of information that we have in our world today,

56
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I think you can completely, as I've said,

57
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.

58
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.

59
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Politics and politicians will only succeed

60
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
if they actually try and treat with people as they are,

61
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
rather than as they would like them to be.

62
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --

63
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
go with the grain of human nature --

64
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
with all the advances in behavioral economics,

65
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
some of which we were just hearing about,

66
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,

67
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
in happiness, in a stronger society

68
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.

69
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?

70
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson

71
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about what I would say are the three passages of history:

72
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age

73
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.

74
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
A simpler way of thinking of it

75
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is that we have gone from a world of local control,

76
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
then we went to a world of central control,

77
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and now we're in a world of people control.

78
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Local power, central power, now, people power.

79
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.

80
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.

81
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Couldn't actually turn back very much,

82
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because if you were king a thousand years ago,

83
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,

84
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
there wasn't much you were in charge of.

85
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.

86
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You could just about go to war and that was about it.

87
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This was the pre-bureaucratic age,

88
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
an age in which everything had to be local.

89
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information

90
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because travel was so restricted.

91
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.

92
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Next part of the cold history lesson,

93
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.

94
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,

95
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.

96
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.

97
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.

98
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize

99
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
health care, education, policing, justice.

100
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.

101
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It had sucked all that power up from the localities.

102
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It was able to do that itself.

103
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:

104
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
the massive information revolution.

105
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Just consider this one fact:

106
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.

107
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,

108
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,

109
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we can send and receive huge quantities of information

110
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
without it costing anything.

111
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,

112
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
where genuine people power is possible.

113
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, what does this mean for our politics,

114
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for our public services, for our government?

115
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,

116
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.

117
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And this is so obvious, in a way, because

118
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you think about how all of you have changed

119
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.

120
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution

121
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,

122
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.

123
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So, how could this happen?

124
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:

125
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,

126
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in giving us that genuine people power.

127
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,

128
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the Missouri Accountability Portal.

129
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In the old days, only the government could hold the information,

130
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and only a few elected people could try and grab that information

131
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and question it and challenge it.

132
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now here, on one website, one state in America,

133
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
every single dollar spent by that government

134
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.

135
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Think of the huge change that means:

136
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Any business that wants to bid for a government contract

137
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
can see what currently is being spent.

138
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"

139
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it's all available there.

140
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We have only, in government and in politics,

141
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world

142
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
with the information revolution.

143
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.

144
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In this country, if we win the election,

145
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds

146
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.

147
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --

148
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
available on the Internet so anyone can see

149
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
what the terms are, what the conditions are,

150
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
driving huge value for money,

151
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.

152
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,

153
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface

154
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of public services like education, or health care or policing,

155
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you're going to see this change massively.

156
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We should be making this change

157
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with the information revolution in our country,

158
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,

159
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,

160
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
who does best at infection control --

161
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health

162
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is now available for all of us to see.

163
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the third of these big changes: accountability.

164
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This, I think, is a huge change.

165
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.

166
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information

167
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
about which crimes are committed where,

168
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and we have to employ people in government

169
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to try and hold the police to account,

170
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,

171
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --

172
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where, when and by whom --

173
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we can hold the police to account.

174
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,

175
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.

176
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You can see what crime is committed where,

177
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.

178
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --

179
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
will make a huge difference.

180
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now I also said the other principle

181
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that I think we should work on is understanding of people,

182
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature

183
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you can achieve so much more.

184
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding

185
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
of why people behave in the way that they do,

186
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.

187
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We're working with some of these people.

188
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,

189
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to try and bring all the experience to book.

190
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.

191
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We want to get people to be more energy efficient.

192
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,

193
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.

194
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
How do you do it?

195
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years

196
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.

197
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We even had -- one government minister once told us to

198
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
brush our teeth in the dark.

199
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I don't think they lasted very long.

200
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.

201
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill

202
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is to show them their own spending,

203
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to show them what their neighbors are spending,

204
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.

205
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
That sort of behavioral economics

206
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
can transform people's behavior

207
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in a way that all the bullying and all the information

208
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.

209
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Other examples are recycling.

210
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We all know we need to recycle more.

211
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
How do we make it happen?

212
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,

213
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,

214
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you can transform their behavior.

215
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So what does all this add up to?

216
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.

217
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple

218
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and powerful formulation,

219
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"

220
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
an incredibly noble sentiment.

221
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
But when he made that speech, what could you do

222
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to build the stronger, better society?

223
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,

224
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you could serve in your country's civil service,

225
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge

226
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.

227
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And I think an even more wonderful speech,

228
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which I'm going to read a big chunk of,

229
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
which sums up what I said at the beginning

230
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
about believing there is more to life than money,

231
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and more that we should try and measure than money.

232
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description

233
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of why gross national product captures so little:

234
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It "does not allow for the health of our children,

235
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.

236
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,

237
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
the intelligence of our public debate.

238
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It measures neither our wit nor our courage,

239
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
neither our wisdom nor our learning,

240
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.

241
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It measures everything, in short,

242
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
except that which makes life worthwhile."

243
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,

244
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,

245
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but now with the huge advances in information technology,

246
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
with the massive changes in behavioral economics,

247
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with all that we know about how you advance well-being,

248
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that if we combine those insights

249
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,

250
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,

251
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,

252
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
it is a dream more easy to realize today

253
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.

254
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Thank you.

255
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have a very difficult task.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm a spectroscopist.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I have to talk about astronomy without showing you

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because my job is spectroscopy.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I never deal with images.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But I'll try to convince you

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that spectroscopy is actually something which can

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
change this world.

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Is there anybody out there?"

12
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Are we alone? SETI.

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.

14
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria,

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
studying these profiles.

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And she published 42 articles

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
just dedicated to the subject.

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,

20
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
observing, the same star for 20 years

21
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is incredible.

22
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But we are crazy. We do these things.

23
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I'm not that far.

25
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.

26
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Because I've noticed

27
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a very small symmetry

28
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the profile of one of the planet host stars.

29
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,

30
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which is an indication that this star

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
has swallowed a planet.

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope

33
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

34
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But you have it in planets and asteroids.

35
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,

36
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you will have this Lithium-6 isotope

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the spectrum of the star.

38
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I invested more than eight months

39
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
just studying the profile of this star.

40
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And actually it's amazing,

41
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,

42
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"

43
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,

44
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you are an astronomer so what you are doing

45
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is actually looking in a telescope.

46
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And you might have seen the planet going into a star.

47
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I was saying, "No, excuse me.

48
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What I see is this one."

49
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.

51
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I bet that there were very few people

52
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who really understood what I'm talking about.

53
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star.

54
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's amazing.

55
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The power of spectroscopy

56
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
was actually realized

57
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by Pink Floyd already in 1973.

58
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Because they actually said that

60
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you can get any color you like

61
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in a spectrum.

62
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And all you need is time and money

63
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to make your spectrograph.

64
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is the number one high resolution,

65
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,

66
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is actually used to detect

67
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
extrasolar planets and sound waves

68
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the atmospheres of stars.

69
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
How we get spectra?

70
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'm sure most of you know from school physics

71
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that it's basically splitting a white light

72
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
into colors.

73
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And if you have a liquid hot mass,

74
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.

75
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
A hot gas is producing emission lines only,

76
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
no continuum.

77
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And if you place a cool gas in front of a

78
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
hot source,

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you will see certain patterns

80
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which we call absorption lines.

81
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements

82
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in a cool matter,

83
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.

84
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now, what we can do with the spectra?

85
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We can actually study line-of-sight velocities

86
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of cosmic objects.

87
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And we can also study chemical composition

88
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and physical parameters of stars,

89
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
galaxies, nebulae.

90
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A star is the most simple object.

91
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,

92
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
creating chemical elements.

93
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And we have a cool atmosphere.

94
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's cool for me.

95
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.

96
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy

97
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.

98
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But you know, everything is relative.

99
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.

100
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is the spectrum of the Sun --

102
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
24,000 spectral lines,

103
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.

104
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,

105
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and we still cannot properly understand

106
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the spectrum of the sun.

107
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Sometimes we have to deal with

108
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
just one tiny, weak spectral line

109
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.

110
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold

111
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.

112
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And we use this weak feature

113
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to measure the composition

114
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.

115
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And now this is a work in progress.

116
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,

117
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which belongs to osmium.

118
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear

119
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
explosions of supernovae.

120
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.

121
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Just comparing the composition of osmium

122
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in one of the planet host stars,

123
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we want to understand why there is so much

124
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of this element.

125
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Perhaps we even think that maybe

126
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.

127
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It can be an indication.

128
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The other day, my colleague from Berkeley,

129
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Gibor Basri, emailed me

130
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
a very interesting spectrum,

131
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"

132
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,

133
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when I saw the huge amount of oxygen

134
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.

135
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.

136
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this

137
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion

138
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in this system, which polluted the atmosphere

139
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of this star.

140
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And later a black hole was formed

141
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in a binary system,

142
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is still there with a mass of about

143
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
five solar masses.

144
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes

145
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
come from supernovae explosions.

146
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements

147
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in different galactic stars,

148
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.

149
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's amazing that you can go so far

150
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
simply studying the chemical composition of stars.

151
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra

152
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.

153
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.

154
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And sometimes they just capture stars.

155
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You've heard about solar flares.

156
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We were very surprised to discover

157
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a super flare,

158
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
a flare which is thousands of millions of times

159
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
more powerful than those we see in the Sun.

160
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy

161
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
called FH Leo,

162
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we discovered the super flare.

163
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And later we went to study the spectral stars

164
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to see is there anything strange with these objects.

165
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And we found that everything is normal.

166
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.

167
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So this is a mystery.

168
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.

169
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And there are six or seven similar cases

170
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
reported in the literature.

171
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now to go ahead with this,

172
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.

173
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to

174
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
try to understand what is here.

175
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story

177
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of the production of chemical elements.

178
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You have two channels --

179
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the massive stars and low-mass stars --

180
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.

181
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And doing this for 14 billion years,

182
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we end up with this picture,

183
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
which is a very important graph,

184
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
showing relative abundances of chemical elements

185
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in sun-like stars

186
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and in the interstellar medium.

187
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So which means that it's really impossible

188
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,

189
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.

190
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And if you find one, I will say that

191
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
this is something related to SETI,

192
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because naturally you can't do it.

193
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Doppler Effect is something very important

194
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
from fundamental physics.

195
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And this is related to the change of the frequency

196
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of a moving source.

197
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.

198
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The precision which we need

199
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to discover a Jupiter-like planet

200
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
around a sun-like star

201
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is something like 28.4 meters per second.

202
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we need nine centimeters per second

203
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to detect an Earth-like planet.

204
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This can be done with the future spectrographs.

205
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team

206
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which is developing a CODEX,

207
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
high resolution, future generation spectrograph

208
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.

209
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And this is going to be an instrument

210
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to detect Earth-like planets

211
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
around sun-like stars.

212
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology

213
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where we can detect sound waves

214
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the atmospheres of stars.

215
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.

216
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We can detect sound waves

217
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

218
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Those waves have frequencies

219
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.

220
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Coming back to the most important question,

221
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Is there anybody out there?"

222
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This is closely related

223
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.

224
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Connection between life

225
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and radioactive nuclei

226
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is straightforward.

227
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
No life without tectonic activity,

228
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
without volcanic activity.

229
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And we know very well that geothermal energy

230
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.

231
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
How to measure, if we have planets

232
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
where the amount of those elements is small,

233
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
so those planets are tectonically dead,

234
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
there cannot be life.

235
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,

236
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
probably, again, there would be no life.

237
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Because can you imagine everything boiling?

238
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's too much energy on a planet.

239
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Now, we have been measuring abundance

240
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.

241
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.

242
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We are actually trying to measure this profile

243
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and to detect thorium.

244
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's very tough. It's very tough.

245
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.

246
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Then you have to convince your colleagues.

247
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And then you have to convince the whole world

248
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that you have actually detected something like this

249
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet

250
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.

251
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's really difficult.

252
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,

253
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
you have to do this job.

254
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have

255
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in those systems.

256
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The one way to discover about aliens

257
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.

258
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If you receive something interesting,

259
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
well that's what SETI does actually,

260
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
what SETI has been doing for many years.

261
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I think the most promising way

262
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is to go for biomarkers.

263
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,

264
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and that is a very clear signal.

265
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,

266
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is a detection of vegetated area.

267
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation

268
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
from a spectrum.

269
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now imagine doing this test

270
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for other planets.

271
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now very recently, very recently,

272
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,

273
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
water, methane, carbon dioxide

274
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
have been detected in the spectrum

275
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of a planet outside the solar system.

276
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.

277
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You can actually go and detect

278
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and study a chemical composition of planets

279
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
far, far, far from solar system.

280
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We have to detect oxygen or ozone

281
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to make sure that we have all necessary conditions

282
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to have life.

283
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Cosmic miracles are something

284
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which can be related to SETI.

285
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now imagine an object, amazing object,

286
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or something which we cannot explain

287
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
when we just stand up and say,

288
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."

289
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,

290
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."

291
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And with the known physics etc,

292
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it's something actually which has been pointed out

293
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
by Frank Drake,

294
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
many years ago, and Shklovsky.

295
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,

296
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
if you see strange chemical elements,

297
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it can be a signal from a civilization

298
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
which is there and they want to signal about it.

299
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
They want to actually signal their presence

300
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
through these spectral lines,

301
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.

302
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There can be different ways doing this.

303
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
One is, for instance, technetium

304
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is a radioactive element

305
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
with a decay time of 4.2 million years.

306
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
If you suddenly observe technetium

307
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in a sun-like star,

308
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you can be sure that somebody has put this

309
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
element in the atmosphere,

310
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
because in a natural way it is impossible to do this.

311
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Now we are reviewing the spectra of about

312
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
300 stars with extrasolar planets.

313
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And we are doing this job since 2000

314
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and it's a very heavy project.

315
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We have been working very hard.

316
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And we have some interesting cases,

317
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.

318
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And I hope in the near future

319
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
we can confirm this.

320
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So the main question: "Are we alone?"

321
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I think it will not come from UFOs.

322
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It will not come from radio signals.

323
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I think it will come from a spectrum like this.

324
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,

325
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,

326
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
as a clear signal of life,

327
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and oxygen and ozone.

328
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
If, one day, and I think it will be

329
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
within 15 years from now, or 20 years.

330
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
If we discover a spectrum like this

331
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
we can be sure that there is life on that planet.

332
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
In about five years we will discover

333
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
planets like Earth, around sun-like stars,

334
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.

335
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It will take about five years.

336
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And then we will need another 10, 15 years

337
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
with space projects

338
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.

339
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And if we see the nitrogen dioxide

340
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and oxygen,

341
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I think we have the perfect E.T.

342
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Thank you very much.

343
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
(Applause)

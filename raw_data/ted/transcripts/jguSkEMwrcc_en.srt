1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, 120 years ago,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Dr. Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That image was the start of the X-ray technology.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The first shot I ever did

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.

11
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And I do really like this shot, because

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in the sole of the sneakers.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
get it right first time.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Moving on to something a bit larger,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
this is an X-ray of a bus.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And the bus is full of people.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And back in the '60s,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
they used to teach student radiographers

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but on dead people.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So, I've still got access to one of these dead people

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because she's very old and fragile.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But everyone on that bus is Frieda.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is the sort of machine you have on borders,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Fairly obvious what that is.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, using large-scale objects

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
does sort of create drama

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Technology is moving ahead,

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and these large cargo scanner X-rays

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Again though, to make it come alive

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you need, somehow, to add the human element.

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And I think the reason this image works, again, is because

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Frieda is driving the bulldozer.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Quite a difficult brief,

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
don't show the surface, I show what's within.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So, the fashionistas don't really like me

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it looks the same.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We all look the same inside, believe me.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I peel back the layers and expose it.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The design comes from within.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's not just Topshop,

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And what's really interesting is,

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And should that pig have grown,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But once the bones had fused together

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it would have been healthy.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So, that's an empty parka jacket.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But I quite love the way it's posed.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Nature is my greatest inspiration.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is how nature is related to architecture.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If you look at the roof of the Eden Project,

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I'm sure those architects are inspired,

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that floats on the top of a pond.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the door to my X-ray room

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is made of lead and steel.

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What's interesting really about X-ray really

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is, if you think about it, is that that technology

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or looking for contraband or whatever.

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I use that sort of technology

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to create things that are quite beautiful.

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So, still working with film, I'm afraid.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
apart from these large cargo-scanning machines,

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is show my pictures big.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They scan each individual X-ray.

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.

112
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.

113
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Still has the tag in it from me buying it,

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But there are four X-ray plates.

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You can see them overlapping.

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, when you move forward from something fairly small,

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a dress which is this size,

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you can see that that is a lot of work.

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
There is over 500 separate components.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And I sent them back an X-ray.

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter) I kid you not.

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.

127
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The one on the left is an x-ray.

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But this time I had to use a real body.

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to make it look like it was a real athlete.

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But people do donate their bodies to art and science.

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And when they do, I'm in the queue.

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So, I like to use them.

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It makes it more organic, more natural.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's whatever takes my fancy, really.

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But I just like it in bright orange.

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
it sort of adds another level.

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The most difficult things to X-ray,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the most technically challenging things to X-ray

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
are the lightest things, the most delicate things.

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
To get the detail in a feather,

152
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that's quite a challenge.

154
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Video: (Music)

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The thing in there is very dangerous.

157
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If you touch that, you could possibly die

158
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
through radiation poisoning.

159
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation,

160
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.

161
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's cumulative.

162
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Music)

163
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It has human connotations.

164
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,

165
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but also it looks like it's a robot,

166
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and it comes from a sci-fi genus.

167
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's a surprise that it has humanity,

168
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but also man-made, future, alien associations.

169
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And it's just a bit spooky.

170
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Music)

171
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,

172
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which is used on the borders

173
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.

174
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices

175
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of X-rays through the lorry.

176
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.

177
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.

178
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.

179
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,

180
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.

181
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, these little details

182
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
help to make it work, make it real.

183
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Music)

184
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The problem with using living people is that

185
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.

186
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So, to avoid that --

187
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
I have to avoid it somehow --

188
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is I use dead people.

189
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,

190
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers

191
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to train in taking X-rays of the human body,

192
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
at different densities.

193
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Music)

194
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.

195
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Music)

196
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,

197
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.

198
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.

199
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Look at this monster.

200
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Music)

201
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's so basic. It just grows wild.

202
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That's what I really like about it,

203
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,

204
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.

205
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's just happening.

206
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.

207
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Not that that is particularly beautiful

208
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
when you look at it with the human eye,

209
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.

210
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.

211
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,

212
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the more time it needs.

213
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The lighter the object, the less radiation.

214
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.

215
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The longer the exposure goes on for,

216
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the more detail you get.

217
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Music)

218
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you look at this, just the tube,

219
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it is quite bright.

220
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.

221
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.

222
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
What I like is how hard the edges are,

223
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
how sharp.

224
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.

225
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Music)

226
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I travel beyond the surface and show

227
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
something for what it's worth,

228
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
for what it's really made of, how it really works.

229
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But also I find that

230
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,

231
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which is things that people are used to seeing.

232
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And that's the sort of thing I've been doing.

233
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I've got the opportunity now to show you

234
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
what I'm going to be doing in the future.

235
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
This is a commercial application of my most recent work.

236
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,

237
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision

238
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.

239
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.

240
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.

241
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.

242
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So, what am I doing in the future?

243
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary

244
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.

245
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So, I've taken it apart, component by component,

246
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
months and months and months of work.

247
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And with this image, I'm going to be displaying

248
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it in the Victoria and Albert Museum

249
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.

250
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,

251
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
not an easy task, in itself.

252
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,

253
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and up against you is a wall.

254
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,

255
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.

256
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I'm going to take that idea

257
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.

258
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.

259
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.

260
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.

261
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'm also looking to

262
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
take my work from the two-dimensional form

263
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to a more three-dimensional form.

264
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And this is quite a good way of doing it.

265
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I'm also working now with X-ray video.

266
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,

267
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and they're actually moving and growing

268
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.

269
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.

270
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause)

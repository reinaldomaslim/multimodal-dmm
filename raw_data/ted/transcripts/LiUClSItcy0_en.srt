0:00:17.366,000 --> 0:00:18,000
To most of you, this is a device

3
0:00:19.244,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to buy, sell, play games,

4
0:00:22.252,000 --> 0:00:23,000
watch videos.

5
0:00:24.162,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I think it might be a lifeline.

6
0:00:26.302,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I think actually it might be able to save more lives

7
0:00:28.718,000 --> 0:00:29,000
than penicillin.

8
0:00:30.218,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Texting:

9
0:00:31.691,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting,

10
0:00:34.51,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see --

11
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:39,000
hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else --

12
0:00:40.385,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or trying to translate the abbreviations

13
0:00:42.177,000 --> 0:00:44,000
LOL, LMAO, HMU.

14
0:00:45.135,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I can help you with those later.

15
0:00:46.968,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But the parents in the room

16
0:00:49.01,000 --> 0:00:5,000
know that texting is actually

17
0:00:50.635,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the best way to communicate with your kids.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids.

19
0:00:56.093,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month,

21
0:01:02.385,000 --> 0:01:05,000
unless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.

22
0:01:05.885,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And the secret is she opens every single one.

23
0:01:09.468,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Texting has a 100 percent open rate.

24
0:01:13.177,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now the parents are really alarmed.

25
0:01:14.593,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's a 100 percent open rate

26
0:01:16.427,000 --> 0:01:17,000
even if she doesn't respond to you

27
0:01:18.177,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner.

28
0:01:19.927,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I promise she read that text.

29
0:01:21.468,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.

30
0:01:27.552,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Texting actually overindexes

31
0:01:28.927,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for minority and urban youth.

32
0:01:31.01,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I know this because at DoSomething.org,

33
0:01:33.885,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is the largest organization

34
0:01:35.593,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for teenagers and social change in America,

35
0:01:38.552,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about six months ago we pivoted

36
0:01:40.01,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and started focusing on text messaging.

37
0:01:41.635,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week

38
0:01:45.843,000 --> 0:01:47,000
about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green

39
0:01:48.552,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or to work on homeless issues and things like that.

40
0:01:51.718,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.

41
0:01:55.135,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We've also found an unintended consequence.

42
0:02:01.218,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We've been getting text messages back like these.

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"I don't want to go to school today.

44
0:02:07.51,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The boys call me faggot."

45
0:02:09.385,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"I was cutting, my parents found out,

46
0:02:13.968,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and so I stopped.

47
0:02:15.843,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But I just started again an hour ago."

48
0:02:18.052,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Or, "He won't stop raping me.

49
0:02:21.343,000 --> 0:02:22,000
He told me not to tell anyone.

50
0:02:22.718,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's my dad. Are you there?"

51
0:02:25.51,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That last one's an actual text message that we received.

52
0:02:28.635,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And yeah, we're there.

53
0:02:31.385,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I will not forget the day we got that text message.

54
0:02:33.927,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And so it was that day that we decided

55
0:02:36.343,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we needed to build a crisis text hotline.

56
0:02:39.468,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Because this isn't what we do.

57
0:02:40.968,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We do social change.

58
0:02:42.302,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Kids are just sending us these text messages

59
0:02:44.302,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them

60
0:02:47.218,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and there's nowhere else to turn

61
0:02:49.01,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that they're sending them to us.

62
0:02:51.593,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful.

63
0:02:53.885,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's fast, it's pretty private.

64
0:02:55.593,000 --> 0:02:58,000
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly.

65
0:02:59.01,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's real time.

66
0:03:01.052,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals.

67
0:03:04.214,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's great.

68
0:03:06.468,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data.

69
0:03:10.885,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl

70
0:03:13.385,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with counseling and referrals.

71
0:03:15.135,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I want to prevent this shit from happening.

72
0:03:18.635,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So think about a cop.

73
0:03:21.968,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There's something in New York City.

74
0:03:23.718,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And then they started crime mapping.

76
0:03:29.843,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And so they started following and watching

77
0:03:31.218,000 --> 0:03:34,000
petty thefts, summonses, all kinds of things --

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
charting the future essentially.

79
0:03:36.01,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they found things like,

80
0:03:38.718,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when you see crystal meth on the street,

81
0:03:40.343,000 --> 0:03:41,000
if you add police presence,

82
0:03:41.968,000 --> 0:03:44,000
you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate

83
0:03:45.093,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of assaults and robberies that would happen.

84
0:03:48.677,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In fact, the year after

85
0:03:49.802,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the NYPD put CompStat in place,

86
0:03:52.427,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the murder rate fell 60 percent.

87
0:03:55.593,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So think about the data from a crisis text line.

88
0:04:00.135,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There is no census on bullying and dating abuse

89
0:04:03.51,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and eating disorders and cutting and rape --

90
0:04:06.427,000 --> 0:04:07,000
no census.

91
0:04:08.177,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Maybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies,

92
0:04:10.51,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that cost lots of money and took lots of time.

93
0:04:13.135,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.

94
0:04:15.51,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Imagine having real time data

95
0:04:18.51,000 --> 0:04:19,000
on every one of those issues.

96
0:04:20.177,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You could inform legislation.

97
0:04:21.968,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You could inform school policy.

98
0:04:23.76,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You could say to a principal,

99
0:04:25.843,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock.

100
0:04:28.635,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What's going on in your school?"

101
0:04:30.593,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You could see the immediate impact of legislation

102
0:04:33.135,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly

103
0:04:35.427,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and see what happens as a result.

104
0:04:38.968,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is really, to me,

105
0:04:40.635,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the power of texting and the power of data.

106
0:04:44.01,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Because while people are talking about data,

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
making it possible for Facebook

108
0:04:47.843,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to mine my friend from the third grade,

109
0:04:50.093,000 --> 0:04:52,000
or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers,

110
0:04:53.052,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or some dude to build a better baseball team,

111
0:04:56.052,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting

112
0:05:01.218,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to help that kid go to school,

113
0:05:03.343,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom

114
0:05:05.427,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.

115
0:05:09.343,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Thank you.

116
0:05:12.135,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

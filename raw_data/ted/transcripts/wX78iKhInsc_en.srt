Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:14.183,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Thank you very much.

3
0:00:17.105,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids.

4
0:00:21.53,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Actually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles --

5
0:00:24.34,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.788,000 --> 0:00:29,000
thinking we were moving to America, but anyway --

7
0:00:30.146,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:32.827,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America.

9
0:00:37.109,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.304,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I got here 12 years ago,

11
0:00:41.059,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and when I got here, I was told various things,

12
0:00:44.869,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like, "Americans don't get irony."

13
0:00:48.628,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:50.792,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Have you come across this idea?

15
0:00:53.038,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's not true.

16
0:00:54.221,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country.

17
0:00:57.007,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony.

18
0:00:59.657,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's one of those cultural myths,

19
0:01:02.258,000 --> 0:01:03,000
like, "The British are reserved."

20
0:01:04.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:06.393,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I don't know why people think this.

22
0:01:08.455,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We've invaded every country we've encountered.

23
0:01:10.966,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:14.818,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But it's not true Americans don't get irony,

25
0:01:17.126,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but I just want you to know that that's what people

26
0:01:19.622,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are saying about you behind your back.

27
0:01:21.456,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You know, so when you leave living rooms in Europe,

28
0:01:24.416,000 --> 0:01:27,000
people say, thankfully, nobody was ironic in your presence.

29
0:01:27.647,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:29.058,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But I knew that Americans get irony

31
0:01:31.619,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when I came across that legislation, "No Child Left Behind."

32
0:01:35.368,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:37.174,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Because whoever thought of that title gets irony.

34
0:01:40.799,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:42.561,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Don't they?

36
0:01:44.043,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Applause)

37
0:01:49.866,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Because it's leaving millions of children behind.

38
0:01:53.413,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation:

39
0:01:56.749,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Millions of Children Left Behind."

40
0:01:58.495,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I can see that.

41
0:02:00.264,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What's the plan?

42
0:02:01.485,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We propose to leave millions of children behind,

43
0:02:04.273,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and here's how it's going to work.

44
0:02:06.035,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And it's working beautifully.

45
0:02:07.445,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:08.476,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In some parts of the country,

47
0:02:09.881,000 --> 0:02:11,000
60 percent of kids drop out of high school.

48
0:02:13.677,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In the Native American communities,

49
0:02:15.368,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it's 80 percent of kids.

50
0:02:17.777,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If we halved that number,

51
0:02:20.368,000 --> 0:02:25,000
one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy

52
0:02:26.05,000 --> 0:02:3,000
over 10 years, of nearly a trillion dollars.

53
0:02:31.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
From an economic point of view,

54
0:02:32.857,000 --> 0:02:34,000
this is good math, isn't it, that we should do this?

55
0:02:35.789,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It actually costs an enormous amount

56
0:02:38.138,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis.

57
0:02:42.3,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg.

58
0:02:46.029,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school

59
0:02:48.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it,

60
0:02:52.282,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who don't get any real benefit from it.

61
0:02:55.622,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And the reason is not that we're not spending enough money.

62
0:02:58.614,000 --> 0:03:01,000
America spends more money on education than most other countries.

63
0:03:02.103,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Class sizes are smaller than in many countries.

64
0:03:05.681,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And there are hundreds of initiatives every year

65
0:03:07.967,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to try and improve education.

66
0:03:10.244,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The trouble is, it's all going in the wrong direction.

67
0:03:14.765,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There are three principles on which human life flourishes,

68
0:03:19.364,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and they are contradicted by the culture of education

69
0:03:23.375,000 --> 0:03:25,000
under which most teachers have to labor

70
0:03:25.652,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and most students have to endure.

71
0:03:29.207,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The first is this, that human beings are naturally different and diverse.

72
0:03:36.387,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Can I ask you, how many of you have got children of your own?

73
0:03:40.892,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Okay. Or grandchildren.

74
0:03:43.905,000 --> 0:03:45,000
How about two children or more? Right.

75
0:03:47.645,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And the rest of you have seen such children.

76
0:03:49.765,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:52.525,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Small people wandering about.

78
0:03:54.039,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:55.785,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I will make you a bet,

80
0:03:57.636,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I am confident that I will win the bet.

81
0:03:59.708,000 --> 0:04:,000
If you've got two children or more,

82
0:04:01.551,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I bet you they are completely different from each other.

83
0:04:05.38,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Aren't they?

84
0:04:07.825,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

85
0:04:09.751,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You would never confuse them, would you?

86
0:04:12.354,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Like, "Which one are you? Remind me."

87
0:04:14.418,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:17.252,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Your mother and I need some color-coding system

89
0:04:19.689,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so we don't get confused."

90
0:04:22.052,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Education under "No Child Left Behind"

91
0:04:24.995,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is based on not diversity but conformity.

92
0:04:29.818,000 --> 0:04:31,000
What schools are encouraged to do is to find out

93
0:04:32.376,000 --> 0:04:35,000
what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.

94
0:04:36.736,000 --> 0:04:38,000
One of the effects of "No Child Left Behind"

95
0:04:39.428,000 --> 0:04:42,000
has been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines.

96
0:04:43.201,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They're very important.

97
0:04:44.835,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'm not here to argue against science and math.

98
0:04:47.098,000 --> 0:04:5,000
On the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient.

99
0:04:51.178,000 --> 0:04:53,000
A real education has to give equal weight

100
0:04:53.377,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to the arts, the humanities, to physical education.

101
0:04:57.114,000 --> 0:04:59,000
An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you --

102
0:04:59.562,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:04.688,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One estimate in America currently is that something like 10 percent of kids,

104
0:05:08.575,000 --> 0:05:09,000
getting on that way,

105
0:05:10.09,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are being diagnosed with various conditions

106
0:05:14.18,000 --> 0:05:17,000
under the broad title of attention deficit disorder.

107
0:05:18.502,000 --> 0:05:19,000
ADHD.

108
0:05:20.234,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I'm not saying there's no such thing.

109
0:05:22.699,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.

110
0:05:25.154,000 --> 0:05:27,000
If you sit kids down, hour after hour,

111
0:05:27.97,000 --> 0:05:28,000
doing low-grade clerical work,

112
0:05:31.306,000 --> 0:05:34,000
don't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know?

113
0:05:34.435,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:35.887,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:42.089,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Children are not, for the most part, suffering from a psychological condition.

116
0:05:46.248,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They're suffering from childhood.

117
0:05:48.261,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:52.379,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I know this because I spent my early life as a child.

119
0:05:55.311,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I went through the whole thing.

120
0:05:58.705,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents,

121
0:06:03.723,000 --> 0:06:04,000
not just a small range of them.

122
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And by the way, the arts aren't just important

123
0:06:07.583,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because they improve math scores.

124
0:06:09.217,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They're important because they speak to parts of children's being

125
0:06:12.358,000 --> 0:06:13,000
which are otherwise untouched.

126
0:06:14.312,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The second, thank you --

127
0:06:16.144,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Applause)

128
0:06:20.562,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The second principle that drives human life flourishing

129
0:06:24.725,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is curiosity.

130
0:06:26.512,000 --> 0:06:29,000
If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child,

131
0:06:29.9,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they will learn without any further assistance, very often.

132
0:06:33.563,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Children are natural learners.

133
0:06:35.548,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out,

134
0:06:39.864,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or to stifle it.

135
0:06:42.155,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Curiosity is the engine of achievement.

136
0:06:46.392,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now the reason I say this

137
0:06:47.769,000 --> 0:06:51,000
is because one of the effects of the current culture here,

138
0:06:51.968,000 --> 0:06:52,000
if I can say so,

139
0:06:53.194,000 --> 0:06:55,000
has been to de-professionalize teachers.

140
0:06:56.876,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There is no system in the world or any school in the country

141
0:07:02.212,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that is better than its teachers.

142
0:07:05.028,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools.

143
0:07:09.723,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But teaching is a creative profession.

144
0:07:12.814,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Teaching, properly conceived, is not a delivery system.

145
0:07:16.174,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You know, you're not there just to pass on received information.

146
0:07:19.246,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Great teachers do that,

147
0:07:21.498,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but what great teachers also do is mentor,

148
0:07:24.567,000 --> 0:07:27,000
stimulate, provoke, engage.

149
0:07:27.936,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You see, in the end, education is about learning.

150
0:07:30.881,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If there's no learning going on, there's no education going on.

151
0:07:33.995,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And people can spend an awful lot of time

152
0:07:35.992,000 --> 0:07:37,000
discussing education without ever discussing learning.

153
0:07:38.589,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The whole point of education is to get people to learn.

154
0:07:41.186,000 --> 0:07:44,000
An old friend of mine -- actually very old, he's dead.

155
0:07:44.976,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:47.672,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.

157
0:07:50.173,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But a wonderful guy he was, wonderful philosopher.

159
0:07:58.737,000 --> 0:08:,000
He used to talk about the difference

160
0:08:01.036,000 --> 0:08:04,000
between the task and achievement senses of verbs.

161
0:08:05.818,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You can be engaged in the activity of something,

162
0:08:08.165,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but not really be achieving it, like dieting.

163
0:08:11.086,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:12.111,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It's a very good example.

165
0:08:13.865,000 --> 0:08:14,000
There he is. He's dieting.

166
0:08:15.236,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Is he losing any weight? Not really.

167
0:08:17.129,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:18.745,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Teaching is a word like that.

169
0:08:20.236,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You can say, "There's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's teaching."

170
0:08:23.902,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But if nobody's learning anything,

171
0:08:25.775,000 --> 0:08:28,000
she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it.

172
0:08:30.419,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning.

173
0:08:33.408,000 --> 0:08:34,000
That's it.

174
0:08:34.679,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And part of the problem is, I think,

175
0:08:36.579,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the dominant culture of education has come to focus

176
0:08:40.035,000 --> 0:08:43,000
on not teaching and learning, but testing.

177
0:08:43.884,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now, testing is important.

178
0:08:45.485,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Standardized tests have a place.

179
0:08:47.798,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But they should not be the dominant culture of education.

180
0:08:50.715,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They should be diagnostic. They should help.

181
0:08:52.835,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

182
0:09:00.247,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If I go for a medical examination, I want some standardized tests.

183
0:09:05.162,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I do.

184
0:09:06.387,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I want to know what my cholesterol level is

185
0:09:08.498,000 --> 0:09:1,000
compared to everybody else's on a standard scale.

186
0:09:10.879,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.

187
0:09:14.145,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:16.246,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange."

189
0:09:18.493,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"Really?"

190
0:09:19.7,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:21.501,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"Is that good?" "We don't know."

192
0:09:23.168,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:24.746,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But all that should support learning.

194
0:09:27.336,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It shouldn't obstruct it, which of course it often does.

195
0:09:31.275,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So in place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance.

196
0:09:35.975,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms

197
0:09:41.499,000 --> 0:09:45,000
rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity.

198
0:09:46.06,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And the third principle is this: that human life is inherently creative.

199
0:09:50.065,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's why we all have different résumés.

200
0:09:52.453,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We create our lives,

201
0:09:54.094,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we can recreate them as we go through them.

202
0:09:56.697,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's the common currency of being a human being.

203
0:09:59.302,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.

204
0:10:03.469,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity,

205
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours?

206
0:10:10.062,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I mean, you may have a dog.

207
0:10:12.78,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And your dog may get depressed.

208
0:10:15.644,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?

209
0:10:18.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:22.019,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

211
0:10:24.948,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:29.145,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"Would you like to come for a walk?"

213
0:10:30.971,000 --> 0:10:31,000
"No, I'm fine."

214
0:10:32.196,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:33.954,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."

216
0:10:37.795,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:39.66,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We all create our own lives through this restless process

218
0:10:42.433,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of imagining alternatives and possibilities,

219
0:10:44.553,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and one of the roles of education

220
0:10:47.019,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity.

221
0:10:50.717,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Instead, what we have is a culture of standardization.

222
0:10:54.417,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, it doesn't have to be that way.

223
0:10:56.663,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It really doesn't.

224
0:10:58.637,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Finland regularly comes out on top in math, science and reading.

225
0:11:03.341,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now, we only know that's what they do well at,

226
0:11:05.635,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because that's all that's being tested.

227
0:11:07.791,000 --> 0:11:08,000
That's one of the problems of the test.

228
0:11:09.673,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They don't look for other things that matter just as much.

229
0:11:12.752,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The thing about work in Finland is this:

230
0:11:16.102,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they don't obsess about those disciplines.

231
0:11:18.474,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They have a very broad approach to education,

232
0:11:20.594,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which includes humanities, physical education, the arts.

233
0:11:25.064,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Second, there is no standardized testing in Finland.

234
0:11:30.511,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I mean, there's a bit,

235
0:11:32.152,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but it's not what gets people up in the morning,

236
0:11:34.462,000 --> 0:11:35,000
what keeps them at their desks.

237
0:11:36.342,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The third thing -- and I was at a meeting recently

238
0:11:38.722,000 --> 0:11:4,000
with some people from Finland, actual Finnish people,

239
0:11:41.287,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland,

240
0:11:46.183,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"What do you do about the drop-out rate in Finland?"

241
0:11:49.782,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And they all looked a bit bemused, and said,

242
0:11:52.212,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"Well, we don't have one.

243
0:11:54.522,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Why would you drop out?

244
0:11:56.591,000 --> 0:11:58,000
If people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly

245
0:11:59.165,000 --> 0:12:,000
and we help and support them."

246
0:12:00.657,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now people always say,

247
0:12:02.248,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America."

248
0:12:05.463,000 --> 0:12:08,000
No. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland.

249
0:12:09.23,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But you can compare it to a state in America.

250
0:12:12.815,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Many states in America have fewer people in them than that.

251
0:12:16.719,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I mean, I've been to some states in America

252
0:12:18.791,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and I was the only person there.

253
0:12:20.372,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:22.199,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Really. Really.

255
0:12:24.824,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I was asked to lock up when I left.

256
0:12:26.802,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

257
0:12:30.897,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But what all the high-performing systems in the world do

258
0:12:34.83,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is currently what is not evident, sadly,

259
0:12:38.718,000 --> 0:12:4,000
across the systems in America --

260
0:12:40.983,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I mean, as a whole.

261
0:12:42.703,000 --> 0:12:43,000
One is this:

262
0:12:44.036,000 --> 0:12:47,000
they individualize teaching and learning.

263
0:12:47.797,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They recognize that it's students who are learning

264
0:12:51.454,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and the system has to engage them,

265
0:12:53.61,000 --> 0:12:56,000
their curiosity, their individuality, and their creativity.

266
0:12:57.305,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That's how you get them to learn.

267
0:12:59.57,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The second is that they attribute a very high status

268
0:13:03.784,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to the teaching profession.

269
0:13:06.353,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They recognize that you can't improve education

270
0:13:09.009,000 --> 0:13:11,000
if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them

271
0:13:12.002,000 --> 0:13:14,000
constant support and professional development.

272
0:13:14.501,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Investing in professional development is not a cost.

273
0:13:17.219,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It's an investment,

274
0:13:18.832,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and every other country that's succeeding well knows that,

275
0:13:21.601,000 --> 0:13:23,000
whether it's Australia, Canada,

276
0:13:24.055,000 --> 0:13:28,000
South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong or Shanghai.

277
0:13:28.506,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They know that to be the case.

278
0:13:30.195,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And the third is,

279
0:13:31.585,000 --> 0:13:34,000
they devolve responsibility to the school level

280
0:13:35.339,000 --> 0:13:36,000
for getting the job done.

281
0:13:37.243,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You see, there's a big difference here

282
0:13:39.372,000 --> 0:13:42,000
between going into a mode of command and control in education --

283
0:13:43.385,000 --> 0:13:44,000
That's what happens in some systems.

284
0:13:45.137,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Central or state governments decide,

285
0:13:47.76,000 --> 0:13:49,000
they know best and they're going to tell you what to do.

286
0:13:50.799,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The trouble is that education doesn't go on

287
0:13:54.318,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings.

288
0:13:57.25,000 --> 0:14:,000
It happens in classrooms and schools,

289
0:14:00.284,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and the people who do it are the teachers and the students,

290
0:14:03.357,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and if you remove their discretion, it stops working.

291
0:14:07.117,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You have to put it back to the people.

292
0:14:09.815,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Applause)

293
0:14:14.991,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There is wonderful work happening in this country.

294
0:14:17.918,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But I have to say it's happening

295
0:14:19.499,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in spite of the dominant culture of education,

296
0:14:22.065,000 --> 0:14:23,000
not because of it.

297
0:14:23.466,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time.

298
0:14:27.07,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And the reason I think is this:

299
0:14:29.732,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that many of the current policies

300
0:14:31.764,000 --> 0:14:35,000
are based on mechanistic conceptions of education.

301
0:14:35.909,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It's like education is an industrial process

302
0:14:39.677,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that can be improved just by having better data,

303
0:14:42.684,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers

304
0:14:45.624,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right,

305
0:14:49.758,000 --> 0:14:51,000
it will all hum along perfectly into the future.

306
0:14:52.576,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It won't, and it never did.

307
0:14:55.805,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The point is that education is not a mechanical system.

308
0:14:59.756,000 --> 0:15:,000
It's a human system.

309
0:15:01.927,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It's about people,

310
0:15:03.88,000 --> 0:15:05,000
people who either do want to learn or don't want to learn.

311
0:15:06.708,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it

312
0:15:11.523,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which is rooted in their own biography.

313
0:15:13.844,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They may find it boring.

314
0:15:15.446,000 --> 0:15:16,000
They may find it irrelevant.

315
0:15:17.166,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school.

316
0:15:22.286,000 --> 0:15:25,000
There are trends, but the stories are always unique.

317
0:15:26.087,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of --

318
0:15:28.765,000 --> 0:15:3,000
they're called alternative education programs.

319
0:15:31.224,000 --> 0:15:34,000
These are programs designed to get kids back into education.

320
0:15:34.552,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They have certain common features.

321
0:15:36.357,000 --> 0:15:37,000
They're very personalized.

322
0:15:38.548,000 --> 0:15:41,000
They have strong support for the teachers,

323
0:15:41.984,000 --> 0:15:44,000
close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum,

324
0:15:45.551,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school.

325
0:15:50.79,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And they work.

326
0:15:52.674,000 --> 0:15:55,000
What's interesting to me is, these are called "alternative education."

327
0:15:56.371,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Laughter)

328
0:15:57.443,000 --> 0:15:58,000
You know?

329
0:15:59.714,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And all the evidence from around the world is,

330
0:16:01.933,000 --> 0:16:03,000
if we all did that, there'd be no need for the alternative.

331
0:16:05.406,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

332
0:16:13.135,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Applause ends)

333
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor.

334
0:16:16.664,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We have to recognize that it's a human system,

335
0:16:19.197,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and there are conditions under which people thrive,

336
0:16:23.077,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and conditions under which they don't.

337
0:16:25.698,000 --> 0:16:28,000
We are after all organic creatures,

338
0:16:28.969,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and the culture of the school is absolutely essential.

339
0:16:33.269,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Culture is an organic term, isn't it?

340
0:16:35.937,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley.

341
0:16:39.627,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Death Valley is the hottest, driest place in America,

342
0:16:45.291,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and nothing grows there.

343
0:16:48.219,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain.

344
0:16:50.664,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Hence, Death Valley.

345
0:16:52.917,000 --> 0:16:58,000
In the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley.

346
0:17:00.064,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period.

347
0:17:04.01,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon.

348
0:17:09.038,000 --> 0:17:14,000
The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while.

349
0:17:15.664,000 --> 0:17:16,000
What it proved is this:

350
0:17:17.45,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that Death Valley isn't dead.

351
0:17:21.424,000 --> 0:17:22,000
It's dormant.

352
0:17:23.569,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility

353
0:17:27.051,000 --> 0:17:3,000
waiting for the right conditions to come about,

354
0:17:30.613,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and with organic systems, if the conditions are right,

355
0:17:34.099,000 --> 0:17:35,000
life is inevitable.

356
0:17:36.29,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It happens all the time.

357
0:17:37.685,000 --> 0:17:39,000
You take an area, a school, a district,

358
0:17:40.27,000 --> 0:17:43,000
you change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility,

359
0:17:43.698,000 --> 0:17:46,000
a different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities,

360
0:17:46.84,000 --> 0:17:49,000
you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners,

361
0:17:50.15,000 --> 0:17:52,000
you offer people the discretion to be creative

362
0:17:52.365,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and to innovate in what they do,

363
0:17:54.208,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and schools that were once bereft spring to life.

364
0:17:57.669,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Great leaders know that.

365
0:17:59.662,000 --> 0:18:01,000
The real role of leadership in education --

366
0:18:01.787,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and I think it's true at the national level,

367
0:18:03.908,000 --> 0:18:04,000
the state level, at the school level --

368
0:18:05.902,000 --> 0:18:08,000
is not and should not be command and control.

369
0:18:10.302,000 --> 0:18:14,000
The real role of leadership is climate control,

370
0:18:14.549,000 --> 0:18:16,000
creating a climate of possibility.

371
0:18:16.852,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And if you do that, people will rise to it

372
0:18:19.306,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate

373
0:18:22.539,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and couldn't have expected.

374
0:18:24.506,000 --> 0:18:26,000
There's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.

375
0:18:26.883,000 --> 0:18:28,000
"There are three sorts of people in the world:

376
0:18:29.486,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Those who are immovable,

377
0:18:32.026,000 --> 0:18:33,000
people who don't get it,

378
0:18:33.273,000 --> 0:18:34,000
or don't want to do anything about it;

379
0:18:35.168,000 --> 0:18:36,000
there are people who are movable,

380
0:18:36.904,000 --> 0:18:37,000
people who see the need for change

381
0:18:38.548,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and are prepared to listen to it;

382
0:18:40.872,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and there are people who move,

383
0:18:42.723,000 --> 0:18:43,000
people who make things happen."

384
0:18:44.796,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement.

385
0:18:49.339,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And if the movement is strong enough,

386
0:18:51.526,000 --> 0:18:53,000
that's, in the best sense of the word, a revolution.

387
0:18:54.866,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And that's what we need.

388
0:18:56.447,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Thank you very much.

389
0:18:57.68,000 --> 0:19:,000
(Applause)

390
0:19:01.569,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Thank you very much.

391
0:19:02.819,000 --> 0:19:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.774,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm turning 44 next month,

2
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year,

3
0:00:19.694,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a year of fulfillment, realization.

4
0:00:23.532,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I have that sense,

5
0:00:24.919,000 --> 0:00:27,000
not because of anything particular in store for me,

6
0:00:27.99,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but because I read it would be a good year

7
0:00:30.774,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.

8
0:00:34.497,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"He felt his own age, forty-four ..."

9
0:00:37.473,000 --> 0:00:39,000
wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"

10
0:00:40.415,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment

11
0:00:42.901,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man,

12
0:00:46.695,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as if he had arrived."

13
0:00:49.207,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me.

14
0:00:52.295,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I also know that he was;

15
0:00:54.617,000 --> 0:00:57,000
for all of us -- you, me, the subject of his book,

16
0:00:58.615,000 --> 0:01:,000
age more or less in step,

17
0:01:00.849,000 --> 0:01:02,000
proceed from birth along the same great sequence:

18
0:01:05.224,000 --> 0:01:07,000
through the wonders and confinements of childhood;

19
0:01:08.425,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence;

20
0:01:12.38,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the empowerments and millstones of adulthood;

21
0:01:16.188,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the recognitions and resignations of old age.

22
0:01:20.391,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There are patterns to life,

23
0:01:22.317,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they are shared.

24
0:01:24.23,000 --> 0:01:28,000
As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."

25
0:01:29.772,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We don't simply live these patterns.

26
0:01:32.013,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We record them, too.

27
0:01:33.766,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We write them down in books, where they become narratives

28
0:01:36.997,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that we can then read and recognize.

29
0:01:39.669,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Books tell us who we've been,

30
0:01:41.984,000 --> 0:01:43,000
who we are, who we will be, too.

31
0:01:45.492,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So they have for millennia.

32
0:01:48.162,000 --> 0:01:49,000
As James Salter wrote,

33
0:01:49.829,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"Life passes into pages if it passes into anything."

34
0:01:54.979,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind:

35
0:01:58.372,000 --> 0:02:01,000
if life passed into pages, there were, somewhere,

36
0:02:02.327,000 --> 0:02:04,000
passages written about every age.

37
0:02:04.711,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative.

38
0:02:08.315,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I could assemble them into a life,

39
0:02:10.377,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a long life, a hundred-year life,

40
0:02:13.147,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the entirety of that same great sequence

41
0:02:15.464,000 --> 0:02:17,000
through which the luckiest among us pass.

42
0:02:19.321,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I was then 37 years old,

43
0:02:22.613,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor.

44
0:02:27.074,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I was prone to meditating on time and age.

45
0:02:30.322,000 --> 0:02:32,000
An illness in the family and later an injury to me

46
0:02:33.189,000 --> 0:02:36,000
had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.

47
0:02:37.056,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable,

48
0:02:40.715,000 --> 0:02:42,000
time seeing through what circumstance did not.

49
0:02:43.947,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was all a bit disheartening.

50
0:02:46.413,000 --> 0:02:48,000
A list, though, would last.

51
0:02:49.334,000 --> 0:02:52,000
To chronicle a life year by vulnerable year

52
0:02:52.503,000 --> 0:02:55,000
would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting,

53
0:02:55.764,000 --> 0:02:58,000
would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future,

54
0:02:59.131,000 --> 0:03:,000
whether we made it there or not.

55
0:03:01.574,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed,

56
0:03:05.685,000 --> 0:03:08,000
searching pages and pages for ages and ages.

57
0:03:09.702,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years.

58
0:03:14.624,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations,"

59
0:03:19.048,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."

60
0:03:23.989,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative.

61
0:03:28.405,000 --> 0:03:32,000
For starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly.

62
0:03:33.151,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Christopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf"

63
0:03:36.335,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to describe a man at 53,

64
0:03:38.51,000 --> 0:03:42,000
only one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36.

65
0:03:42.853,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:45.154,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably

67
0:03:48.797,000 --> 0:03:49,000
from one year to the next,

68
0:03:50.609,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and that people may experience the same age differently.

69
0:03:54.045,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But even so, as the list coalesced,

70
0:03:57.643,000 --> 0:04:,000
so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror,

71
0:04:01.056,000 --> 0:04:02,000
did the life that I had been living:

72
0:04:03.71,000 --> 0:04:06,000
finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;"

73
0:04:08.002,000 --> 0:04:12,000
emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;"

74
0:04:13.057,000 --> 0:04:17,000
learning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms

75
0:04:17.197,000 --> 0:04:19,000
[I would] not be coming back to."

76
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There I was.

77
0:04:23.885,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Of course, there we all are.

78
0:04:26.762,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer

79
0:04:29.224,000 --> 0:04:31,000
whose beautiful visualizations you see here,

80
0:04:32.519,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and who today is 85 --

81
0:04:34.403,000 --> 0:04:38,000
all those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov --

82
0:04:39.211,000 --> 0:04:42,000
noted to me that, like art and like color,

83
0:04:43.455,000 --> 0:04:45,000
literature helps us to remember what we've experienced.

84
0:04:47.095,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather,

85
0:04:50.857,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he nodded in recognition.

86
0:04:53.339,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He was then 95 and soon to die,

87
0:04:57.234,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which, wrote Roberto Bolaño,

88
0:04:59.379,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"... is the same as never dying."

89
0:05:03.556,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And looking back, he said to me that, yes,

90
0:05:07.357,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Proust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die,

91
0:05:13.873,000 --> 0:05:15,000
just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right

92
0:05:16.678,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that at 90, we are sure we will.

93
0:05:21.229,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It had happened to him,

94
0:05:23.234,000 --> 0:05:24,000
as to them.

95
0:05:27.479,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now the list is done:

96
0:05:30.169,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a hundred years.

97
0:05:33.443,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And looking back over it,

98
0:05:36.298,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I know that I am not done.

99
0:05:38.8,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I still have my life to live,

100
0:05:40.919,000 --> 0:05:42,000
still have many more pages to pass into.

101
0:05:44.546,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And mindful of Mailer,

102
0:05:46.422,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I await 44.

103
0:05:48.746,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Thank you.

104
0:05:49.948,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

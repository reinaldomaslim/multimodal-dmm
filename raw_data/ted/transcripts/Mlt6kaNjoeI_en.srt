2
0:00:12.884,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When we use the word "architect" or "designer,"

3
0:00:16.053,000 --> 0:00:18,000
what we usually mean is a professional,

4
0:00:18.852,000 --> 0:00:2,000
someone who gets paid,

5
0:00:21.324,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and we tend to assume that it's those professionals

6
0:00:24.247,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who are going to be the ones to help us solve

7
0:00:26.228,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the really big, systemic design challenges that we face

8
0:00:28.788,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like climate change, urbanization and social inequality.

9
0:00:32.633,000 --> 0:00:35,000
That's our kind of working presumption.

10
0:00:35.717,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I think it's wrong, actually.

11
0:00:38.724,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school

12
0:00:41.972,000 --> 0:00:43,000
after several years, and go out and get a job,

13
0:00:44.645,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and this happened.

14
0:00:47.57,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The economy ran out of jobs.

15
0:00:49.82,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And a couple of things struck me about this.

16
0:00:52.275,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One, don't listen to career advisers.

17
0:00:56.005,000 --> 0:01:,000
And two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,

18
0:01:00.661,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,

19
0:01:04.931,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.

20
0:01:08.889,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,

21
0:01:12.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but actually there's an economics behind architecture

22
0:01:14.556,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that we don't talk about, and I think we need to.

23
0:01:17.024,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And a good place to start is your own paycheck.

24
0:01:20.655,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,

25
0:01:23.097,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.

26
0:01:26.073,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.

27
0:01:29.689,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now in terms of the whole world's population,

28
0:01:31.394,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,

29
0:01:36.276,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?

30
0:01:40.036,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The uncomfortable fact is that

31
0:01:42.747,000 --> 0:01:44,000
actually almost everything that we call architecture today

32
0:01:45.631,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is actually the business of designing

33
0:01:47.923,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for about the richest one percent of the world's population,

34
0:01:50.848,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it always has been.

35
0:01:53.077,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The reason why we forgot that

36
0:01:54.824,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is because the times in history when architecture

37
0:01:56.927,000 --> 0:01:58,000
did the most to transform society were those times

38
0:01:59.852,000 --> 0:02:01,000
when, actually, the one percent would build

39
0:02:02.509,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,

40
0:02:05.544,000 --> 0:02:07,000
whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,

41
0:02:08.159,000 --> 0:02:1,000
communism in the early 20th,

42
0:02:10.429,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the welfare state, and most recently, of course,

43
0:02:13.467,000 --> 0:02:16,000
through this inflated real estate bubble.

44
0:02:17.083,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And all of those booms, in their own various ways,

45
0:02:20.391,000 --> 0:02:21,000
have now kicked the bucket,

46
0:02:22.31,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and we're back in this situation

47
0:02:24.596,000 --> 0:02:28,000
where the smartest designers and architects in the world

48
0:02:29.512,000 --> 0:02:32,000
are only really able to work for one percent of the population.

49
0:02:33.292,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy,

50
0:02:35.402,000 --> 0:02:36,000
though I think it probably is,

51
0:02:37.241,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.

52
0:02:40.337,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects

53
0:02:43.196,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is, how are we going to turn our client

54
0:02:45.238,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from the one percent to the 100 percent?

55
0:02:48.859,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas

56
0:02:52.433,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for how it might be done.

57
0:02:54.275,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The first is, I think we need to question this idea

58
0:02:57.657,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that architecture is about making buildings.

59
0:02:59.948,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Actually, a building is about the most expensive solution

60
0:03:02.692,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you can think of to almost any given problem.

61
0:03:05.708,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested

62
0:03:08.236,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in solving problems and creating new conditions.

63
0:03:10.968,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So here's a story.

64
0:03:12.49,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The office was working with a school,

65
0:03:14.088,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and they had an old Victorian school building.

66
0:03:16.514,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And they said to the architects, "Look,

67
0:03:19.245,000 --> 0:03:2,000
our corridors are an absolute nightmare.

68
0:03:21.198,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They're far too small. They get congested between classes.

69
0:03:23.564,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There's bullying. We can't control them.

70
0:03:25.947,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,

71
0:03:28.789,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and we know it's going to cost several million pounds,

72
0:03:30.979,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but we're reconciled to the fact."

73
0:03:32.89,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the team thought about this, and they went away,

74
0:03:35.596,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and they said, "Actually, don't do that.

75
0:03:37.613,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Instead, get rid of the school bell.

76
0:03:40.393,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,

77
0:03:43.222,000 --> 0:03:45,000
have several smaller school bells that go off

78
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in different places and different times,

79
0:03:47.728,000 --> 0:03:49,000
distribute the traffic through the corridors."

80
0:03:49.976,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It solves the same problem,

81
0:03:51.393,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but instead of spending several million pounds,

82
0:03:54.201,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you spend several hundred pounds.

83
0:03:56.344,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,

84
0:03:59.144,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.

85
0:04:01.705,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Architects are actually really, really good

86
0:04:03.178,000 --> 0:04:05,000
at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.

87
0:04:05.52,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,

88
0:04:07.482,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we got fixated on the idea of providing

89
0:04:09.665,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a particular kind of consumer product,

90
0:04:11.946,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.

91
0:04:14.416,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing

92
0:04:18.617,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that mass architecture is about big --

93
0:04:21.878,000 --> 0:04:23,000
big buildings and big finance.

94
0:04:24.472,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Actually, we've got ourselves locked into this

95
0:04:26.561,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Industrial Era mindset which says that

96
0:04:28.968,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the only people who can make cities are large organizations

97
0:04:32.454,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or corporations who build on our behalf,

98
0:04:34.972,000 --> 0:04:35,000
procuring whole neighborhoods

99
0:04:36.78,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in single, monolithic projects, and of course,

100
0:04:40.213,000 --> 0:04:42,000
form follows finance.

101
0:04:42.432,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods

102
0:04:45.456,000 --> 0:04:48,000
based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.

103
0:04:49.144,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And a lot of people can't even afford them.

104
0:04:51.657,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities

105
0:04:54.624,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to be made not just by the few with a lot

106
0:04:57.394,000 --> 0:05:,000
but also by the many with a bit?

107
0:05:00.582,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And when they do, they bring with them

108
0:05:01.876,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.

109
0:05:05.215,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it raises really interesting questions about,

110
0:05:07.319,000 --> 0:05:1,000
how will we plan cities? How will finance development?

111
0:05:10.602,000 --> 0:05:11,000
How will we sell design services?

112
0:05:12.263,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What would it mean for democratic societies

113
0:05:14.503,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to offer their citizens a right to build?

114
0:05:16.903,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,

115
0:05:19.183,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.

116
0:05:24.652,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And thirdly, we need to remember that,

117
0:05:27.816,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from a strictly economic point of view,

118
0:05:30.167,000 --> 0:05:34,000
design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly --

119
0:05:35.013,000 --> 0:05:37,000
mostly it's done by amateurs.

120
0:05:37.609,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And that's a good thing.

121
0:05:39.495,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy

122
0:05:42.965,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in what's called the social economy or the core economy,

123
0:05:45.025,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which is people doing it for themselves.

124
0:05:47.417,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And the problem is that, up until now,

125
0:05:50.665,000 --> 0:05:51,000
it was the monetary economy which had

126
0:05:52.467,000 --> 0:05:54,000
all the infrastructure and all the tools.

127
0:05:54.625,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So the challenge we face is, how are we going

128
0:05:56.448,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions

129
0:05:59.682,000 --> 0:06:,000
for architecture's social economy?

130
0:06:01.422,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And that began with open-source software.

131
0:06:04.154,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And over the last few years, it's been moving

132
0:06:06.522,000 --> 0:06:08,000
into the physical world with open-source hardware,

133
0:06:09.017,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which are freely shared blueprints

134
0:06:10.547,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that anyone can download and make for themselves.

135
0:06:14.593,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.

136
0:06:17.834,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Right? When suddenly you had a 3D printer

137
0:06:21.37,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that was open-source, the parts for which

138
0:06:22.924,000 --> 0:06:24,000
could be made on another 3D printer.

139
0:06:25.205,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Or the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,

140
0:06:28.266,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.

141
0:06:32.762,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What these technologies are doing is radically

142
0:06:35.576,000 --> 0:06:38,000
lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.

143
0:06:38.657,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They're challenging the idea that

144
0:06:40.239,000 --> 0:06:43,000
if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.

145
0:06:44.065,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And they're distributing massively

146
0:06:46.398,000 --> 0:06:48,000
really complex manufacturing capabilities.

147
0:06:49.285,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,

148
0:06:53.416,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and increasingly that means

149
0:06:54.611,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that the design team is everyone.

150
0:06:57.898,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That really is an industrial revolution.

151
0:07:00.424,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And when we think that the major ideological conflicts

152
0:07:03.64,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that we inherited were all based around this question

153
0:07:05.658,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of who should control the means of production,

154
0:07:07.57,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and these technologies are coming back with a solution:

155
0:07:10.297,000 --> 0:07:13,000
actually, maybe no one. All of us.

156
0:07:14.286,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And we were fascinated by

157
0:07:16.455,000 --> 0:07:18,000
what that might mean for architecture.

158
0:07:19.062,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So about a year and a half ago,

159
0:07:21.584,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we started working on a project called WikiHouse,

160
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.

161
0:07:26.754,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And the idea is to make it possible for anyone

162
0:07:29.552,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to go online, access a freely shared library

163
0:07:31.936,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of 3D models which they can download and adapt in,

164
0:07:36.397,000 --> 0:07:39,000
at the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,

165
0:07:39.788,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and almost at the click of a switch

166
0:07:42.347,000 --> 0:07:44,000
they can generate a set of cutting files

167
0:07:44.831,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which allow them, in effect,

168
0:07:46.872,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine

169
0:07:50.06,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and a standard sheet material like plywood.

170
0:07:53.271,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And the parts are all numbered,

171
0:07:56.391,000 --> 0:08:,000
and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.

172
0:08:00.568,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:02.839,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And it goes together without any bolts.

174
0:08:05.105,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It uses wedge and peg connections.

175
0:08:07.295,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And even the mallets to make it

176
0:08:09.439,000 --> 0:08:11,000
can be provided on the cutting sheets as well.

177
0:08:11.919,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And a team of about two or three people,

178
0:08:14.456,000 --> 0:08:16,000
working together, can build this.

179
0:08:16.495,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They don't need any traditional construction skills.

180
0:08:18.975,000 --> 0:08:21,000
They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,

181
0:08:22.126,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and they can build a small house of about this size

182
0:08:24.639,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in about a day.

183
0:08:29.403,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:36.706,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house

185
0:08:39.701,000 --> 0:08:41,000
onto which you can then apply systems like windows

186
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and cladding and insulation and services

187
0:08:44.218,000 --> 0:08:47,000
based on what's cheap and what's available.

188
0:08:47.267,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Of course, the house is never finished.

189
0:08:49.452,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.

190
0:08:52.333,000 --> 0:08:54,000
With the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it

191
0:08:55.09,000 --> 0:08:58,000
over its life or even use it to make the house next door.

192
0:08:58.947,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,

193
0:09:02.385,000 --> 0:09:06,000
citizen-led urban development model, potentially.

194
0:09:06.66,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,

195
0:09:10.21,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and some really interesting lessons here.

196
0:09:12.331,000 --> 0:09:14,000
One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.

197
0:09:14.658,000 --> 0:09:18,000
People get confused between construction work and having fun.

198
0:09:19.356,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But the principles of openness go right down

199
0:09:22.015,000 --> 0:09:24,000
into the really mundane, physical details.

200
0:09:24.821,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.

201
0:09:27.824,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Or, when you're designing a piece,

202
0:09:29.123,000 --> 0:09:31,000
make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,

203
0:09:32.003,000 --> 0:09:34,000
or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.

204
0:09:34.956,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Probably the principal which runs deepest with us

205
0:09:38.998,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,

206
0:09:41.953,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the open-source pioneer,

207
0:09:44.678,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which was that idea of, "Be lazy like a fox."

208
0:09:47.967,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Don't reinvent the wheel every time.

209
0:09:49.676,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Take what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.

210
0:09:53.469,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught

211
0:09:56.052,000 --> 0:10:,000
at an architecture school, copying is good.

212
0:10:00.149,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Which is appropriate, because actually,

213
0:10:02.15,000 --> 0:10:03,000
this approach is not innovative.

214
0:10:03.93,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's actually how we built buildings

215
0:10:05.539,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution

216
0:10:08.035,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in these sorts of community barn-raisings.

217
0:10:10.462,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The only difference between traditional

218
0:10:12.606,000 --> 0:10:14,000
vernacular architecture and open-source architecture

219
0:10:15.014,000 --> 0:10:17,000
might be a web connection,

220
0:10:17.134,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but it's a really, really big difference.

221
0:10:19.946,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We shared the whole of WikiHouse

222
0:10:21.377,000 --> 0:10:22,000
under a Creative Commons license,

223
0:10:23.219,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and now what's just beginning to happen

224
0:10:24.641,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is that groups around the world are beginning to take it

225
0:10:26.623,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.

226
0:10:29.362,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand

227
0:10:32.327,000 --> 0:10:35,000
looking at post-earthquake development housing,

228
0:10:35.462,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and thanks to the TED city Prize,

229
0:10:38.71,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas

230
0:10:41.449,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to set up a kind of community factory

231
0:10:43.938,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and micro-university.

232
0:10:45.852,000 --> 0:10:46,000
These are very, very small beginnings,

233
0:10:47.716,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and actually there's more people in the last week

234
0:10:50.591,000 --> 0:10:52,000
who have got in touch and they're not even on this map.

235
0:10:52.774,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.

236
0:10:56.514,000 --> 0:11:,000
We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,

237
0:11:00.963,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but it's a small answer to a really, really big question,

238
0:11:04.535,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities

239
0:11:08.311,000 --> 0:11:1,000
are not skyscraper cities.

240
0:11:10.542,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They're self-made cities in one form or another.

241
0:11:14.638,000 --> 0:11:17,000
If we're talking about the 21st-century city,

242
0:11:18.262,000 --> 0:11:2,000
these are the guys who are going to be making it.

243
0:11:20.886,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.

244
0:11:25.368,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So if we're serious about problems

245
0:11:27.494,000 --> 0:11:31,000
like climate change, urbanization and health,

246
0:11:31.648,000 --> 0:11:34,000
actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.

247
0:11:35.546,000 --> 0:11:37,000
As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank

248
0:11:37.634,000 --> 0:11:39,000
or a corporation or a government or an NGO

249
0:11:40.411,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who's going to be able to do it

250
0:11:41.797,000 --> 0:11:44,000
if we treat citizens only as consumers.

251
0:11:45.446,000 --> 0:11:48,000
How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively

252
0:11:49.227,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we were to develop solutions not just to the problem

253
0:11:51.5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of structure that we've been working on,

254
0:11:53.914,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,

255
0:11:58.634,000 --> 0:12:,000
off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation --

256
0:12:01.45,000 --> 0:12:04,000
low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions

257
0:12:05.379,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that anyone can very, very easily make,

258
0:12:07.319,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and to put them all into a commons

259
0:12:09.22,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?

260
0:12:13.568,000 --> 0:12:17,000
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff?

261
0:12:17.738,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And once something's in the commons,

262
0:12:19.779,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it will always be there.

263
0:12:21.135,000 --> 0:12:24,000
How much would that change the rules?

264
0:12:24.663,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And I think the technology's on our side.

265
0:12:28.099,000 --> 0:12:31,000
If design's great project in the 20th century

266
0:12:31.759,000 --> 0:12:34,000
was the democratization of consumption --

267
0:12:35.52,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA —

268
0:12:41.946,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I think design's great project in the 21st century

269
0:12:45.568,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is the democratization of production.

270
0:12:48.44,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And when it comes to architecture in cities,

271
0:12:51.12,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that really matters.

272
0:12:53.192,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you very much.

273
0:12:54.946,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Applause)

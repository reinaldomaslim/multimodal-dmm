2
0:00:12.837,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want you to look around the room for a minute

3
0:00:15.128,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and try to find the most paranoid person here --

4
0:00:17.871,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:18.959,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And then I want you to point at that person for me.

6
0:00:21.435,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:22.494,000 --> 0:00:23,000
OK, don't actually do it.

8
0:00:23.877,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:25.02,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But, as an organizational psychologist,

10
0:00:26.913,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I spend a lot of time in workplaces,

11
0:00:28.819,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I find paranoia everywhere.

12
0:00:31.532,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Paranoia is caused by people that I call "takers."

13
0:00:33.965,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Takers are self-serving in their interactions.

14
0:00:36.172,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's all about what can you do for me.

15
0:00:38.832,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The opposite is a giver.

16
0:00:40.257,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking,

17
0:00:43.041,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"What can I do for you?"

18
0:00:45.165,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style.

19
0:00:48.06,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We all have moments of giving and taking.

20
0:00:50.037,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Your style is how you treat most of the people most of the time,

21
0:00:53.077,000 --> 0:00:54,000
your default.

22
0:00:54.259,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I have a short test you can take

23
0:00:55.825,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to figure out if you're more of a giver or a taker,

24
0:00:58.348,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and you can take it right now.

25
0:00:59.85,000 --> 0:01:,000
[The Narcissist Test]

26
0:01:01.313,000 --> 0:01:03,000
[Step 1: Take a moment to think about yourself.]

27
0:01:03.649,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:04.776,000 --> 0:01:06,000
[Step 2: If you made it to Step 2, you are not a narcissist.]

29
0:01:07.658,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:10.082,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is the only thing I will say today that has no data behind it,

31
0:01:13.939,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but I am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon,

32
0:01:17.395,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the more worried we should be that you're a taker.

33
0:01:19.846,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:20.935,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Of course, not all takers are narcissists.

35
0:01:22.991,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Some are just givers who got burned one too many times.

36
0:01:25.903,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Then there's another kind of taker that we won't be addressing today,

37
0:01:29.251,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and that's called a psychopath.

38
0:01:31.128,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:32.303,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was curious, though, about how common these extremes are,

40
0:01:35.199,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and so I surveyed over 30,000 people across industries

41
0:01:38.032,000 --> 0:01:39,000
around the world's cultures.

42
0:01:39.668,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I found that most people are right in the middle

43
0:01:42.17,000 --> 0:01:43,000
between giving and taking.

44
0:01:43.66,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They choose this third style called "matching."

45
0:01:46.029,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If you're a matcher, you try to keep an even balance of give and take:

46
0:01:49.398,000 --> 0:01:52,000
quid pro quo -- I'll do something for you if you do something for me.

47
0:01:52.74,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And that seems like a safe way to live your life.

48
0:01:55.145,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But is it the most effective and productive way to live your life?

49
0:01:58.353,000 --> 0:02:,000
The answer to that question is a very definitive ...

50
0:02:00.841,000 --> 0:02:01,000
maybe.

51
0:02:02.023,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:03.273,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I studied dozens of organizations,

53
0:02:05.476,000 --> 0:02:06,000
thousands of people.

54
0:02:06.675,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I had engineers measuring their productivity.

55
0:02:10.251,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:12.63,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I looked at medical students' grades --

57
0:02:15.623,000 --> 0:02:16,000
even salespeople's revenue.

58
0:02:17.622,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:19.092,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And, unexpectedly,

60
0:02:20.768,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers.

61
0:02:24.749,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The engineers who got the least work done

62
0:02:26.817,000 --> 0:02:28,000
were the ones who did more favors than they got back.

63
0:02:29.347,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They were so busy doing other people's jobs,

64
0:02:31.507,000 --> 0:02:34,000
they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed.

65
0:02:35.081,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In medical school, the lowest grades belong to the students

66
0:02:37.91,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who agree most strongly with statements like,

67
0:02:40.041,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"I love helping others,"

68
0:02:43.068,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which suggests the doctor you ought to trust

69
0:02:45.316,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody.

70
0:02:48.419,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

71
0:02:49.47,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And then in sales, too, the lowest revenue accrued

72
0:02:51.852,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the most generous salespeople.

73
0:02:53.571,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I actually reached out to one of those salespeople

74
0:02:56.025,000 --> 0:02:57,000
who had a very high giver score.

75
0:02:57.656,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I asked him, "Why do you suck at your job --"

76
0:03:00.238,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I didn't ask it that way, but --

77
0:03:01.803,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:02.871,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?"

79
0:03:05.247,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And he said, "Well, I just care so deeply about my customers

80
0:03:08.537,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that I would never sell them one of our crappy products."

81
0:03:11.323,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:12.748,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So just out of curiosity,

83
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
how many of you self-identify more as givers than takers or matchers?

84
0:03:17.308,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Raise your hands.

85
0:03:18.962,000 --> 0:03:2,000
OK, it would have been more before we talked about these data.

86
0:03:22.525,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But actually, it turns out there's a twist here,

87
0:03:26.176,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because givers are often sacrificing themselves,

88
0:03:29.496,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but they make their organizations better.

89
0:03:32.345,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We have a huge body of evidence --

90
0:03:35.136,000 --> 0:03:38,000
many, many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior

91
0:03:38.893,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that exists in a team or an organization --

92
0:03:41.054,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge

93
0:03:44.164,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and providing mentoring,

94
0:03:45.341,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the better organizations do on every metric we can measure:

95
0:03:48.142,000 --> 0:03:5,000
higher profits, customer satisfaction, employee retention --

96
0:03:50.997,000 --> 0:03:51,000
even lower operating expenses.

97
0:03:53.407,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people

98
0:03:56.299,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and improve the team,

99
0:03:57.53,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and then, unfortunately, they suffer along the way.

100
0:04:00.03,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I want to talk about what it takes

101
0:04:01.722,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed.

102
0:04:05.564,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So I wondered, then, if givers are the worst performers,

103
0:04:08.608,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who are the best performers?

104
0:04:11.438,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Let me start with the good news: it's not the takers.

105
0:04:14.112,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs.

106
0:04:17.791,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And they fall at the hands of matchers.

107
0:04:19.912,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you're a matcher, you believe in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.

108
0:04:23.356,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so when you meet a taker,

109
0:04:24.8,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you feel like it's your mission in life

110
0:04:26.693,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to just punish the hell out of that person.

111
0:04:28.759,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

112
0:04:29.797,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that way justice gets served.

113
0:04:32.108,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Well, most people are matchers.

114
0:04:34.102,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And that means if you're a taker,

115
0:04:35.71,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it tends to catch up with you eventually;

116
0:04:37.714,000 --> 0:04:38,000
what goes around will come around.

117
0:04:39.376,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And so the logical conclusion is:

118
0:04:41.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it must be the matchers who are the best performers.

119
0:04:43.895,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But they're not.

120
0:04:45.437,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In every job, in every organization I've ever studied,

121
0:04:48.311,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the best results belong to the givers again.

122
0:04:51.651,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Take a look at some data I gathered from hundreds of salespeople,

123
0:04:54.833,000 --> 0:04:55,000
tracking their revenue.

124
0:04:56.01,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What you can see is that the givers go to both extremes.

125
0:04:58.689,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue,

126
0:05:01.931,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but also the highest revenue.

127
0:05:03.421,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The same patterns were true for engineers' productivity

128
0:05:06.049,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and medical students' grades.

129
0:05:07.464,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top

130
0:05:10.095,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of every success metric that I can track.

131
0:05:12.201,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Which raises the question:

132
0:05:13.527,000 --> 0:05:16,000
How do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel?

133
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I want to talk about how to do that, not just in businesses,

134
0:05:19.807,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but also in nonprofits, schools --

135
0:05:21.662,000 --> 0:05:22,000
even governments.

136
0:05:22.979,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Are you ready?

137
0:05:24.209,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Cheers)

138
0:05:25.419,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I was going to do it anyway, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

139
0:05:28.435,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:29.482,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The first thing that's really critical

141
0:05:31.35,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is to recognize that givers are your most valuable people,

142
0:05:34.121,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but if they're not careful, they burn out.

143
0:05:36.579,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So you have to protect the givers in your midst.

144
0:05:39.093,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I learned a great lesson about this from Fortune's best networker.

145
0:05:44.993,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's the guy, not the cat.

146
0:05:46.367,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

147
0:05:47.551,000 --> 0:05:48,000
His name is Adam Rifkin.

148
0:05:49.331,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur

149
0:05:51.567,000 --> 0:05:53,000
who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people.

150
0:05:54.385,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And his secret weapon is the five-minute favor.

151
0:05:57.261,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Adam said, "You don't have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi

152
0:05:59.944,000 --> 0:06:,000
to be a giver.

153
0:06:01.151,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You just have to find small ways to add large value

154
0:06:03.678,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to other people's lives."

155
0:06:05.059,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That could be as simple as making an introduction

156
0:06:07.426,000 --> 0:06:09,000
between two people who could benefit from knowing each other.

157
0:06:10.381,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback.

158
0:06:13.742,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Or It might be even something as basic as saying,

159
0:06:16.078,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"You know,

160
0:06:17.331,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I'm going to try and figure out

161
0:06:18.855,000 --> 0:06:21,000
if I can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed."

162
0:06:22.462,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And those five-minute favors are really critical

163
0:06:24.78,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves.

164
0:06:27.962,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The second thing that matters

165
0:06:29.431,000 --> 0:06:31,000
if you want to build a culture where givers succeed,

166
0:06:31.923,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is you actually need a culture where help-seeking is the norm;

167
0:06:34.872,000 --> 0:06:35,000
where people ask a lot.

168
0:06:36.536,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This may hit a little too close to home for some of you.

169
0:06:39.229,000 --> 0:06:42,000
[So in all your relationships, you always have to be the giver?]

170
0:06:42.292,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

171
0:06:43.34,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What you see with successful givers

172
0:06:45.095,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is they recognize that it's OK to be a receiver, too.

173
0:06:48.754,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If you run an organization, we can actually make this easier.

174
0:06:51.641,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We can make it easier for people to ask for help.

175
0:06:53.962,000 --> 0:06:55,000
A couple colleagues and I studied hospitals.

176
0:06:56.058,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We found that on certain floors, nurses did a lot of help-seeking,

177
0:06:59.284,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and on other floors, they did very little of it.

178
0:07:01.559,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The factor that stood out on the floors where help-seeking was common,

179
0:07:04.929,000 --> 0:07:05,000
where it was the norm,

180
0:07:06.104,000 --> 0:07:08,000
was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was

181
0:07:08.503,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to help other nurses on the unit.

182
0:07:10.558,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When that role was available,

183
0:07:11.963,000 --> 0:07:14,000
nurses said, "It's not embarrassing, it's not vulnerable to ask for help --

184
0:07:15.644,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it's actually encouraged."

185
0:07:18.263,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Help-seeking isn't important just for protecting the success

186
0:07:21.113,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and the well-being of givers.

187
0:07:22.536,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's also critical to getting more people to act like givers,

188
0:07:25.492,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because the data say

189
0:07:26.705,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of all giving in organizations

190
0:07:30.129,000 --> 0:07:31,000
starts with a request.

191
0:07:31.996,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But a lot of people don't ask.

192
0:07:33.468,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They don't want to look incompetent,

193
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
they don't know where to turn, they don't want to burden others.

194
0:07:38.291,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Yet if nobody ever asks for help,

195
0:07:40.024,000 --> 0:07:42,000
you have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization

196
0:07:42.723,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who would love to step up and contribute,

197
0:07:44.73,000 --> 0:07:46,000
if they only knew who could benefit and how.

198
0:07:47.413,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But I think the most important thing,

199
0:07:49.235,000 --> 0:07:51,000
if you want to build a culture of successful givers,

200
0:07:51.735,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team.

201
0:07:54.561,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I figured, you want a culture of productive generosity,

202
0:07:57.601,000 --> 0:07:58,000
you should hire a bunch of givers.

203
0:07:59.597,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But I was surprised to discover, actually, that that was not right --

204
0:08:03.715,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that the negative impact of a taker on a culture

205
0:08:06.214,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver.

206
0:08:09.53,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Think about it this way:

207
0:08:10.704,000 --> 0:08:11,000
one bad apple can spoil a barrel,

208
0:08:12.392,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but one good egg just does not make a dozen.

209
0:08:15.942,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I don't know what that means --

210
0:08:17.518,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

211
0:08:18.661,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But I hope you do.

212
0:08:20.058,000 --> 0:08:23,000
No -- let even one taker into a team,

213
0:08:23.404,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and you will see that the givers will stop helping.

214
0:08:26.648,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They'll say, "I'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks.

215
0:08:29.602,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Why should I contribute?"

216
0:08:30.992,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Whereas if you let one giver into a team,

217
0:08:32.992,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you don't get an explosion of generosity.

218
0:08:35.138,000 --> 0:08:36,000
More often, people are like,

219
0:08:36.583,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"Great! That person can do all our work."

220
0:08:39.077,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, effective hiring and screening and team building

221
0:08:41.847,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is not about bringing in the givers;

222
0:08:44.007,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it's about weeding out the takers.

223
0:08:47.036,000 --> 0:08:48,000
If you can do that well,

224
0:08:48.211,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you'll be left with givers and matchers.

225
0:08:50.177,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The givers will be generous

226
0:08:51.566,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because they don't have to worry about the consequences.

227
0:08:54.224,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm.

228
0:08:57.361,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So how do you catch a taker before it's too late?

229
0:09:00.745,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We're actually pretty bad at figuring out who's a taker,

230
0:09:03.656,000 --> 0:09:04,000
especially on first impressions.

231
0:09:05.506,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There's a personality trait that throws us off.

232
0:09:07.838,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's called agreeableness,

233
0:09:09.167,000 --> 0:09:11,000
one the major dimensions of personality across cultures.

234
0:09:11.812,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Agreeable people are warm and friendly, they're nice, they're polite.

235
0:09:15.321,000 --> 0:09:16,000
You find a lot of them in Canada --

236
0:09:17.136,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

237
0:09:18.763,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Where there was actually a national contest

238
0:09:22.284,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to come up with a new Canadian slogan and fill in the blank,

239
0:09:25.338,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"As Canadian as ..."

240
0:09:26.937,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I thought the winning entry was going to be,

241
0:09:29.045,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"As Canadian as maple syrup," or, "... ice hockey."

242
0:09:31.54,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But no, Canadians voted for their new national slogan to be --

243
0:09:34.549,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I kid you not --

244
0:09:35.734,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"As Canadian as possible under the circumstances."

245
0:09:38.189,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

246
0:09:42.02,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now for those of you who are highly agreeable,

247
0:09:44.415,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or maybe slightly Canadian,

248
0:09:45.832,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you get this right away.

249
0:09:47.229,000 --> 0:09:48,000
How could I ever say I'm any one thing

250
0:09:49.07,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when I'm constantly adapting to try to please other people?

251
0:09:52.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Disagreeable people do less of it.

252
0:09:54.247,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They're more critical, skeptical, challenging,

253
0:09:57.208,000 --> 0:10:,000
and far more likely than their peers to go to law school.

254
0:10:00.286,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

255
0:10:01.453,000 --> 0:10:03,000
That's not a joke, that's actually an empirical fact.

256
0:10:04.132,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

257
0:10:05.215,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So I always assumed that agreeable people were givers

258
0:10:07.788,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and disagreeable people were takers.

259
0:10:09.759,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But then I gathered the data,

260
0:10:11.213,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and I was stunned to find no correlation between those traits,

261
0:10:14.35,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because it turns out that agreeableness-disagreeableness

262
0:10:17.033,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is your outer veneer:

263
0:10:18.22,000 --> 0:10:19,000
How pleasant is it to interact with you?

264
0:10:20.185,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives:

265
0:10:22.901,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What are your values? What are your intentions toward others?

266
0:10:25.817,000 --> 0:10:27,000
If you really want to judge people accurately,

267
0:10:28.033,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for,

268
0:10:31.574,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and draw a two-by-two.

269
0:10:32.763,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

270
0:10:37.648,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The agreeable givers are easy to spot:

271
0:10:39.679,000 --> 0:10:41,000
they say yes to everything.

272
0:10:43.74,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly,

273
0:10:46.637,000 --> 0:10:49,000
although you might call them by a slightly different name.

274
0:10:50.568,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

275
0:10:53.828,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We forget about the other two combinations.

276
0:10:55.924,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There are disagreeable givers in our organizations.

277
0:10:59.283,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There are people who are gruff and tough on the surface

278
0:11:01.948,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but underneath have others' best interests at heart.

279
0:11:05.089,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Or as an engineer put it,

280
0:11:06.476,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"Oh, disagreeable givers --

281
0:11:08.106,000 --> 0:11:11,000
like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system."

282
0:11:12.006,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

283
0:11:13.316,000 --> 0:11:14,000
If that helps you.

284
0:11:14.711,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

285
0:11:16.424,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Disagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in our organizations,

286
0:11:19.951,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because they're the ones who give the critical feedback

287
0:11:22.567,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear.

288
0:11:25.197,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We need to do a much better job valuing these people

289
0:11:27.709,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as opposed to writing them off early,

290
0:11:29.521,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,

291
0:11:31.289,000 --> 0:11:32,000
must be a selfish taker."

292
0:11:33.849,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The other combination we forget about is the deadly one --

293
0:11:36.632,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the agreeable taker, also known as the faker.

294
0:11:40.444,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is the person who's nice to your face,

295
0:11:42.533,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and then will stab you right in the back.

296
0:11:44.537,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter)

297
0:11:46.537,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process

298
0:11:49.795,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is to ask the question,

299
0:11:51.091,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"Can you give me the names of four people

300
0:11:53.077,000 --> 0:11:55,000
whose careers you have fundamentally improved?"

301
0:11:56.424,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The takers will give you four names,

302
0:11:58.341,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they will all be more influential than them,

303
0:12:01.062,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down.

304
0:12:04.957,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy,

305
0:12:08.381,000 --> 0:12:09,000
who don't have as much power,

306
0:12:09.951,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who can do them no good.

307
0:12:11.723,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And let's face it, you all know you can learn a lot about character

308
0:12:14.921,000 --> 0:12:16,000
by watching how someone treats their restaurant server

309
0:12:17.5,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or their Uber driver.

310
0:12:19.319,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So if we do all this well,

311
0:12:20.609,000 --> 0:12:22,000
if we can weed takers out of organizations,

312
0:12:22.717,000 --> 0:12:23,000
if we can make it safe to ask for help,

313
0:12:24.653,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if we can protect givers from burnout

314
0:12:26.691,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and make it OK for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals

315
0:12:29.942,000 --> 0:12:31,000
as well as trying to help other people,

316
0:12:32.122,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we can actually change the way that people define success.

317
0:12:35.053,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Instead of saying it's all about winning a competition,

318
0:12:38.429,000 --> 0:12:41,000
people will realize success is really more about contribution.

319
0:12:42.761,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I believe that the most meaningful way to succeed

320
0:12:45.146,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is to help other people succeed.

321
0:12:47.04,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And if we can spread that belief,

322
0:12:48.735,000 --> 0:12:5,000
we can actually turn paranoia upside down.

323
0:12:51.41,000 --> 0:12:52,000
There's a name for that.

324
0:12:52.597,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's called "pronoia."

325
0:12:55.025,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Pronoia is the delusional belief

326
0:12:56.746,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that other people are plotting your well-being.

327
0:12:59.37,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

328
0:13:02.908,000 --> 0:13:04,000
That they're going around behind your back

329
0:13:05.485,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and saying exceptionally glowing things about you.

330
0:13:09.647,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The great thing about a culture of givers is that's not a delusion --

331
0:13:13.48,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it's reality.

332
0:13:15.697,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I want to live in a world where givers succeed,

333
0:13:18.297,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and I hope you will help me create that world.

334
0:13:20.643,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Thank you.

335
0:13:21.888,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

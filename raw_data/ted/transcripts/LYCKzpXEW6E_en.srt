1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Last year, I went on my first book tour.

2
0:00:16.271,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries

3
0:00:19.613,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and gave some hundred talks.

4
0:00:22.462,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Every talk in every country

5
0:00:24.999,000 --> 0:00:25,000
began with an introduction,

6
0:00:26.999,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and every introduction began, alas, with a lie:

7
0:00:32.567,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria,"

8
0:00:35.912,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States."

9
0:00:40.428,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,

10
0:00:42.999,000 --> 0:00:44,000
no matter the country that concluded it --

11
0:00:45.588,000 --> 0:00:47,000
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --

12
0:00:47.999,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I thought, "But that's not true."

13
0:00:51.127,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.

14
0:00:55.436,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria,

15
0:00:58.807,000 --> 0:00:59,000
currently lives in Ghana.

16
0:01:00.815,000 --> 0:01:04,000
My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony,

17
0:01:05.064,000 --> 0:01:06,000
raised in Ghana,

18
0:01:06.673,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

19
0:01:10.804,000 --> 0:01:15,000
For this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational."

20
0:01:16.498,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,

21
0:01:20.49,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"I'm a human being."

22
0:01:23.124,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,

23
0:01:26.308,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark

24
0:01:29.808,000 --> 0:01:32,000
where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann.

25
0:01:33.58,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We were discussing the role of locality in writing,

26
0:01:36.494,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when suddenly it hit me.

27
0:01:39.157,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'm not multinational.

28
0:01:41.166,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'm not a national at all.

29
0:01:44.186,000 --> 0:01:46,000
How could I come from a nation?

30
0:01:46.999,000 --> 0:01:49,000
How can a human being come from a concept?

31
0:01:50.745,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.

32
0:01:55.403,000 --> 0:01:58,000
From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,

33
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
I had learned to speak of countries

34
0:02:00.886,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things,

35
0:02:05.673,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but I wondered:

36
0:02:07.554,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to say that I came from a country

37
0:02:09.35,000 --> 0:02:12,000
suggested that the country was an absolute,

38
0:02:12.389,000 --> 0:02:14,000
some fixed point in place in time,

39
0:02:15.095,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a constant thing, but was it?

40
0:02:18.191,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In my lifetime, countries had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;

41
0:02:22.841,000 --> 0:02:26,000
appeared -- Timor-Leste; failed -- Somalia.

42
0:02:27.224,000 --> 0:02:31,000
My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.

43
0:02:31.522,000 --> 0:02:37,000
To me, a country -- this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract --

44
0:02:37.856,000 --> 0:02:4,000
hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.

45
0:02:41.602,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.

46
0:02:47.232,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What we call countries are actually

47
0:02:49.194,000 --> 0:02:51,000
various expressions of sovereign statehood,

48
0:02:51.867,000 --> 0:02:54,000
an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.

49
0:02:56.295,000 --> 0:03:,000
When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations,

50
0:03:01.205,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I felt a sort of surge of relief.

51
0:03:03.598,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It was as I had suspected.

52
0:03:06.352,000 --> 0:03:09,000
History was real, cultures were real,

53
0:03:10.047,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but countries were invented.

54
0:03:13.022,000 --> 0:03:17,000
For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself,

55
0:03:17.507,000 --> 0:03:19,000
my world, my work, my experience,

56
0:03:19.999,000 --> 0:03:21,000
beyond the logic of the state.

57
0:03:22.198,000 --> 0:03:26,000
In 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan,"

58
0:03:26.761,000 --> 0:03:31,000
sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.

59
0:03:32.053,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience,

60
0:03:36.596,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.

61
0:03:42.224,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked,

62
0:03:47.248,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"when she's never known the indignities

63
0:03:49.54,000 --> 0:03:51,000
of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"

64
0:03:52.777,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, if I'm honest,

65
0:03:54.999,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I knew just what she meant.

66
0:03:56.999,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana.

67
0:04:00.472,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Her parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent.

68
0:04:05.506,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand,

69
0:04:10.53,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana."

70
0:04:15.648,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In my mind, she came from Lebanon,

71
0:04:18.259,000 --> 0:04:21,000
despite the patent fact that all her formative experience

72
0:04:21.999,000 --> 0:04:22,000
took place in suburban Accra.

73
0:04:24.376,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I, like my critics,

74
0:04:26.742,000 --> 0:04:31,000
was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin

75
0:04:32.296,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or none held U.K. passports.

76
0:04:35.219,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I'd fallen into the limiting trap

77
0:04:37.45,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that the language of coming from countries sets --

78
0:04:40.645,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the privileging of a fiction, the singular country,

79
0:04:44.4,000 --> 0:04:47,000
over reality: human experience.

80
0:04:48.363,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Speaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.

81
0:04:53.433,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"All experience is local," he said.

82
0:04:56.788,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"All identity is experience," I thought.

83
0:05:00.836,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.

84
0:05:04.71,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."

85
0:05:07.876,000 --> 0:05:11,000
See, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth.

86
0:05:12.452,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I have no relationship with the United States,

87
0:05:15.253,000 --> 0:05:17,000
all 50 of them, not really.

88
0:05:17.831,000 --> 0:05:2,000
My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up;

89
0:05:21.638,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with New York City, where I started work;

90
0:05:24.203,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.

91
0:05:27.797,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent,

92
0:05:33.061,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but these very particular experiences

93
0:05:35.721,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and the places they occur.

94
0:05:38.076,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Despite my pride in Ewe culture,

95
0:05:40.831,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food,

96
0:05:43.999,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.

97
0:05:48.738,000 --> 0:05:51,000
My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives,

98
0:05:52.417,000 --> 0:05:53,000
where I go each year,

99
0:05:54.052,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours.

100
0:05:59.209,000 --> 0:06:01,000
These are the places that shape my experience.

101
0:06:02.607,000 --> 0:06:04,000
My experience is where I'm from.

102
0:06:05.999,000 --> 0:06:08,000
What if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?" --

103
0:06:09.782,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"Where are you a local?"

104
0:06:11.61,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.

105
0:06:16.047,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Tell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés?

106
0:06:20.655,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France?

107
0:06:25.355,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,

108
0:06:28.613,000 --> 0:06:32,000
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.

109
0:06:33.002,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Our experience is where we're from.

110
0:06:35.999,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, where are you a local?

111
0:06:38.07,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I propose a three-step test.

112
0:06:40.601,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I call these the three "R’s": rituals, relationships, restrictions.

113
0:06:46.619,000 --> 0:06:49,000
First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be:

114
0:06:50.557,000 --> 0:06:52,000
making your coffee, driving to work,

115
0:06:52.614,000 --> 0:06:54,000
harvesting your crops, saying your prayers.

116
0:06:55.514,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What kind of rituals are these?

117
0:06:57.76,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Where do they occur?

118
0:06:59.237,000 --> 0:07:03,000
In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?

119
0:07:04.582,000 --> 0:07:08,000
As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston,

120
0:07:08.999,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.

121
0:07:13.654,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We took off our shoes in the house,

122
0:07:15.525,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we were unfailingly polite with our elders,

123
0:07:18.239,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.

124
0:07:20.865,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South.

125
0:07:26.132,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy,

126
0:07:29.999,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I was shocked by how at home I felt.

127
0:07:32.359,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The rituals were familiar.

128
0:07:34.975,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"R" number one, rituals.

129
0:07:37.578,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days.

130
0:07:42.065,000 --> 0:07:44,000
To whom do you speak at least once a week,

131
0:07:44.629,000 --> 0:07:46,000
be it face to face or on FaceTime?

132
0:07:47.453,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Be reasonable in your assessment;

133
0:07:49.183,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I'm not talking about your Facebook friends.

134
0:07:52.064,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.

135
0:07:56.371,000 --> 0:07:58,000
My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston,

136
0:07:58.999,000 --> 0:08:,000
my best friends in New York:

137
0:08:01.065,000 --> 0:08:03,000
these relationships are home for me.

138
0:08:03.822,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"R" number two, relationships.

139
0:08:06.665,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships,

140
0:08:10.999,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but how we experience our locality

141
0:08:13.765,000 --> 0:08:16,000
depends in part on our restrictions.

142
0:08:17.075,000 --> 0:08:19,000
By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?

143
0:08:19.942,000 --> 0:08:21,000
What passport do you hold?

144
0:08:21.999,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Are you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live?

145
0:08:27.29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
By civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation,

146
0:08:31.577,000 --> 0:08:35,000
from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child?

147
0:08:36.396,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is the least sexy of the R’s,

148
0:08:39.017,000 --> 0:08:41,000
less lyric than rituals and relationships,

149
0:08:41.999,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but the question takes us past "Where are you now?"

150
0:08:45.333,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to "Why aren't you there, and why?"

151
0:08:49.174,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.

152
0:08:52.503,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Take a piece of paper

153
0:08:54.052,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and put those three words on top of three columns,

154
0:08:57.368,000 --> 0:09:,000
then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.

155
0:09:01.041,000 --> 0:09:05,000
A very different picture of your life in local context,

156
0:09:05.226,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of your identity as a set of experiences,

157
0:09:08.664,000 --> 0:09:09,000
may emerge.

158
0:09:09.848,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So let's try it.

159
0:09:11.088,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I have a friend named Olu.

160
0:09:12.877,000 --> 0:09:13,000
He's 35 years old.

161
0:09:14.496,000 --> 0:09:17,000
His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.

162
0:09:18.465,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10.

163
0:09:22.05,000 --> 0:09:24,000
When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London,

164
0:09:24.867,000 --> 0:09:25,000
then came to Berlin.

165
0:09:26.316,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He loves going to Nigeria --

166
0:09:28.999,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the weather, the food, the friends --

167
0:09:31.657,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but hates the political corruption there.

168
0:09:34.655,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Where is Olu from?

169
0:09:36.426,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I have another friend named Udo.

170
0:09:38.641,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He's also 35 years old.

171
0:09:40.624,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Udo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina,

172
0:09:43.847,000 --> 0:09:46,000
where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland,

173
0:09:47.059,000 --> 0:09:48,000
after the war.

174
0:09:48.511,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Udo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin.

175
0:09:52.417,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He loves going to Argentina -- the weather, the food, the friends --

176
0:09:56.642,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but hates the economic corruption there.

177
0:09:59.467,000 --> 0:10:,000
Where is Udo from?

178
0:10:01.429,000 --> 0:10:04,000
With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German,

179
0:10:05.086,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin.

180
0:10:09.166,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history.

181
0:10:13.499,000 --> 0:10:16,000
That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin,

182
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that has to do with life.

183
0:10:18.774,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.

184
0:10:22.999,000 --> 0:10:24,000
He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,

185
0:10:25.414,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and English with a German one.

186
0:10:27.517,000 --> 0:10:29,000
To claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though,

187
0:10:30.082,000 --> 0:10:32,000
denies his experience in Lagos,

188
0:10:32.434,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the rituals he practiced growing up,

189
0:10:34.641,000 --> 0:10:36,000
his relationship with family and friends.

190
0:10:37.531,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Meanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes,

191
0:10:41.476,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Olu always feels restricted there,

192
0:10:43.999,000 --> 0:10:45,000
not least by the fact that he's gay.

193
0:10:47.228,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions

194
0:10:50.975,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of their parents' countries,

195
0:10:52.652,000 --> 0:10:54,000
from living where some of their most meaningful rituals

196
0:10:55.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and relationships occur.

197
0:10:57.634,000 --> 0:11:01,000
To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina

198
0:11:01.759,000 --> 0:11:03,000
distracts from their common experience.

199
0:11:03.896,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.

200
0:11:08.146,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Of course, when we ask, "Where are you from?"

201
0:11:10.584,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we're using a kind of shorthand.

202
0:11:12.529,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin,"

203
0:11:16.916,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer,

204
0:11:20.771,000 --> 0:11:22,000
from country to city to neighborhood.

205
0:11:23.255,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But that's not quite the point.

206
0:11:26.31,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The difference between "Where are you from?"

207
0:11:28.923,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and "Where are you a local?"

208
0:11:30.463,000 --> 0:11:32,000
isn't the specificity of the answer;

209
0:11:33.449,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it's the intention of the question.

210
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us

211
0:11:41.206,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to shift our focus to where real life occurs.

212
0:11:45.349,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup,

213
0:11:49.59,000 --> 0:11:54,000
gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players.

214
0:11:55.659,000 --> 0:11:57,000
As a unit of measurement for human experience,

215
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
the country doesn't quite work.

216
0:12:00.999,000 --> 0:12:03,000
That's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria."

217
0:12:05.249,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units,

218
0:12:10.629,000 --> 0:12:14,000
one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.

219
0:12:15.164,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences,

220
0:12:19.61,000 --> 0:12:23,000
layers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed.

221
0:12:24.176,000 --> 0:12:26,000
You can take away my passport,

222
0:12:26.432,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but you can't take away my experience.

223
0:12:28.563,000 --> 0:12:3,000
That I carry within me.

224
0:12:30.698,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.

225
0:12:34.253,000 --> 0:12:37,000
To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.

226
0:12:37.645,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There's much to be said for national history,

227
0:12:39.803,000 --> 0:12:4,000
more for the sovereign state.

228
0:12:41.788,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Culture exists in community, and community exists in context.

229
0:12:46.509,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Geography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important.

230
0:12:51.006,000 --> 0:12:53,000
What I'm questioning is primacy.

231
0:12:53.999,000 --> 0:12:57,000
All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation,

232
0:12:58.687,000 --> 0:13:02,000
as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.

233
0:13:03.51,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?

234
0:13:07.439,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?

235
0:13:10.999,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Here's one possibility:

236
0:13:12.294,000 --> 0:13:14,000
basically, countries represent power.

237
0:13:15.588,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"Where are you from?" Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.

238
0:13:20.671,000 --> 0:13:23,000
America. Germany. Japan. More power.

239
0:13:24.189,000 --> 0:13:26,000
China. Russia. Ambiguous.

240
0:13:27.703,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

241
0:13:29.387,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game,

242
0:13:33.072,000 --> 0:13:36,000
especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.

243
0:13:36.437,000 --> 0:13:38,000
As any recent immigrant knows,

244
0:13:38.731,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the question "Where are you from?" or "Where are you really from?"

245
0:13:42.999,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is often code for "Why are you here?"

246
0:13:46.324,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing

247
0:13:49.46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of elite American colleges.

248
0:13:51.257,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"Students think that their environment is diverse

249
0:13:54.432,000 --> 0:13:57,000
if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan --

250
0:13:57.711,000 --> 0:14:01,000
never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers."

251
0:14:02.114,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm with him.

252
0:14:03.297,000 --> 0:14:06,000
To call one student American, another Pakistani,

253
0:14:06.792,000 --> 0:14:09,000
then triumphantly claim student body diversity

254
0:14:10.077,000 --> 0:14:13,000
ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.

255
0:14:13.744,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.

256
0:14:17.593,000 --> 0:14:21,000
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi

257
0:14:22.289,000 --> 0:14:25,000
have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions

258
0:14:26.136,000 --> 0:14:27,000
than nationality implies.

259
0:14:27.946,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries

260
0:14:31.565,000 --> 0:14:32,000
is the myth of going back to them.

261
0:14:33.303,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana.

262
0:14:36.422,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana.

263
0:14:40.766,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's not because I wasn't born there.

264
0:14:42.591,000 --> 0:14:44,000
My father can't go back, either.

265
0:14:44.948,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The country in which he was born,

266
0:14:46.999,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that country no longer exists.

267
0:14:49.357,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.

268
0:14:53.216,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Something, somewhere will always have changed,

269
0:14:56.088,000 --> 0:14:57,000
most of all, ourselves.

270
0:14:58.738,000 --> 0:14:59,000
People.

271
0:14:59.985,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Finally, what we're talking about is human experience,

272
0:15:02.556,000 --> 0:15:05,000
this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.

273
0:15:06.888,000 --> 0:15:09,000
In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.

274
0:15:10.31,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The more we know about where a story is set,

275
0:15:12.611,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the more local color and texture,

276
0:15:14.999,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the more human the characters start to feel,

277
0:15:17.5,000 --> 0:15:19,000
the more relatable, not less.

278
0:15:19.8,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from

279
0:15:24.268,000 --> 0:15:28,000
confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.

280
0:15:29.254,000 --> 0:15:33,000
In fact, all of us are multi -- multi-local, multi-layered.

281
0:15:33.583,000 --> 0:15:36,000
To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity

282
0:15:37.391,000 --> 0:15:4,000
brings us closer together, I think, not further apart.

283
0:15:40.996,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So the next time that I'm introduced,

284
0:15:44.322,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I'd love to hear the truth:

285
0:15:46.195,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here.

286
0:15:50.226,000 --> 0:15:54,000
She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.

287
0:15:54.308,000 --> 0:15:56,000
She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra."

288
0:15:57.411,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you.

289
0:15:58.596,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In India, we have these huge families.

2
0:00:15.84,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.

3
0:00:18.44,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Which means that there are a lot of family events.

4
0:00:21.84,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.

5
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But the one thing that I always looked forward to

6
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:31,000
was playing around with my cousins.

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And there was always this one uncle

8
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who used to be there,

9
0:00:35.76,000 --> 0:00:36,000
always ready, jumping around with us,

10
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:38,000
having games for us,

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
making us kids have the time of our lives.

12
0:00:42.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This man was extremely successful:

13
0:00:45.28,000 --> 0:00:47,000
he was confident and powerful.

14
0:00:47.92,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.

15
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

16
0:00:56.76,000 --> 0:01:,000
Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system,

17
0:01:00.84,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which means that this person who used to be independent

18
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult.

19
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My uncle started using a walker to walk,

20
0:01:12.48,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and to take a turn,

21
0:01:13.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
he literally had to take one step at a time, like this,

22
0:01:17.8,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and it took forever.

23
0:01:20.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So this person, who used to be the center of attention

24
0:01:23.44,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in every family gathering,

25
0:01:25.52,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was suddenly hiding behind people.

26
0:01:28.4,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.

27
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And he's not the only one in the world.

28
0:01:35.28,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,

29
0:01:40.8,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and this number is only rising.

30
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:49,000
As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems,

31
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
one solution that solves it all,

32
0:01:52.64,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but it need not always be like that.

33
0:01:55.68,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You can also target simple problems

34
0:01:58.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact.

35
0:02:03.12,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's,

36
0:02:06.52,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but to make their everyday tasks much more simple,

37
0:02:09.72,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and then make an impact.

38
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?

39
0:02:16.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public

40
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:22,000
just out of embarrassment,

41
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.

42
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It works just purely on its form.

43
0:02:29.96,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors,

44
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.

45
0:02:38.8,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.

46
0:02:44.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person,

47
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.

48
0:02:53.92,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, well, one problem solved,

49
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
many more to go.

50
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
All this while, I was interviewing him,

51
0:03:01.08,000 --> 0:03:02,000
questioning him,

52
0:03:02.64,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information,

53
0:03:06.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or just answers to my questions.

54
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.

55
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks,

56
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.

57
0:03:19.8,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table,

58
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land,

59
0:03:29.08,000 --> 0:03:3,000
how does he climb a staircase?

60
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase

61
0:03:35.04,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like in the developed countries.

62
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:39,000
One actually has to climb the stairs.

63
0:03:39.92,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So he told me,

64
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Well, let me show you how I do it."

65
0:03:43.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Let's take a look at what I saw.

66
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So he took really long to reach this position,

67
0:03:51.64,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and then all this while, I'm thinking,

68
0:03:53.52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?

69
0:03:55.48,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?"

70
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And then ...

71
0:04:02.28,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And the turns, he took them so easily.

73
0:04:13.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So -- shocked?

74
0:04:14.92,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Well, I was too.

75
0:04:19.32,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So this person who could not walk on flat land

76
0:04:22.32,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.

77
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:29,000
On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.

78
0:04:30.399,000 --> 0:04:33,000
There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms

79
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and uses a walker,

80
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but the moment he's put on a cycle,

81
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:38,000
all his symptoms vanish,

82
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because it is a continuous motion.

83
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase

84
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
back to flat land.

85
0:04:47.88,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him,

86
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.

87
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause)

89
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He walked faster, right?

90
0:05:06.48,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Applause)

91
0:05:11.24,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I call this the staircase illusion,

92
0:05:14.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze,

93
0:05:18.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and this is called freezing of gait.

94
0:05:20.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So it happens a lot,

95
0:05:21.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms,

96
0:05:25.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
making them feel much more confident?

97
0:05:29.44,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You know, technology is not always it.

98
0:05:32.12,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What we need are human-centered solutions.

99
0:05:34.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I could have easily made it into a projection,

100
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or a Google Glass, or something like that.

101
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.

102
0:05:42.36,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This print could be taken into hospitals

103
0:05:45.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to make them feel much more welcome.

104
0:05:48.6,000 --> 0:05:51,000
What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient

105
0:05:51.72,000 --> 0:05:53,000
feel like my uncle felt that day.

106
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:57,000
He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.

107
0:05:59.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech,

108
0:06:03.96,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day.

109
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective?

110
0:06:12.32,000 --> 0:06:15,000
All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity,

111
0:06:16.32,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to go out there, observe.

112
0:06:18.6,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But let's not stop at that.

113
0:06:20.52,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Let's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them.

114
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Break them, boil them down into much smaller problems,

115
0:06:27.8,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and then find simple solutions for them.

116
0:06:30.32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Test these solutions, fail if needed,

117
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but with newer insights to make it better.

118
0:06:36.24,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions.

119
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions?

120
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.

121
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Thank you.

122
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.873,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"

3
0:00:17.901,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and when I worked on this film, I discovered something

4
0:00:19.781,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about how our brains work, and how our brains work

5
0:00:22.244,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is that, when we're sort of infused with

6
0:00:24.523,000 --> 0:00:28,000
either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,

7
0:00:28.769,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it changes and alters our perception of things.

8
0:00:31.177,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.

9
0:00:33.354,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create

10
0:00:36.862,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch

11
0:00:40.782,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for this particular movie, because I put it out there,

12
0:00:44.204,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment

13
0:00:46.261,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and bring a group of people like this in a projection room

14
0:00:49.869,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and play this stock footage, and when I played this

15
0:00:52.549,000 --> 0:00:54,000
stock footage, I simply wanted to find out

16
0:00:55.35,000 --> 0:00:58,000
what people remembered, what was memorable about it?

17
0:00:58.765,000 --> 0:01:,000
What should I actually try to replicate?

18
0:01:00.768,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What should I try to emulate to some degree?

19
0:01:04.539,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.

20
0:01:07.628,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And what I discovered is, because of the nature

21
0:01:10.31,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,

22
0:01:12.508,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there was an emotion that was built into it

23
0:01:14.461,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us

24
0:01:17.539,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and all these various things.

25
0:01:19.213,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after

26
0:01:21.245,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the screening was over, what they thought of it,

27
0:01:24.036,000 --> 0:01:26,000
what was your memorable shots, they changed them.

28
0:01:26.502,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They were -- had camera moves on them.

29
0:01:28.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,

30
0:01:31.556,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell

31
0:01:34.538,000 --> 0:01:35,000
were you looking at just a few minutes ago

32
0:01:35.905,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?

33
0:01:39.749,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually

34
0:01:43.597,000 --> 0:01:46,000
replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.

35
0:01:47.287,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,

36
0:01:51.269,000 --> 0:01:53,000
taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then

37
0:01:53.977,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the combination of all the different shots and all

38
0:01:56.419,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the different things put together created their sort of

39
0:01:58.347,000 --> 0:02:,000
collective consciousness of what they remembered

40
0:02:00.386,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it looked like, but not what it really looked like.

41
0:02:02.036,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."

42
0:02:05.034,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Launch noises)

43
0:02:09.501,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence

44
0:02:12.267,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,

45
0:02:14.328,000 --> 0:02:17,000
including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty

46
0:02:17.626,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with the subject matter.

47
0:02:19.35,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I basically shot everything with short lenses,

48
0:02:21.987,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which means that you're very close to the action,

49
0:02:23.904,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots

50
0:02:26.194,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically

51
0:02:28.834,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was setting up something that would remind you

52
0:02:30.818,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)

53
0:02:34.29,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is

54
0:02:36.821,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

55
0:02:40.422,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Music)

56
0:02:53.332,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

57
0:02:55.447,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)

58
0:02:58.238,000 --> 0:03:,000
Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.

59
0:03:00.678,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:02.836,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,

61
0:03:06.241,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I'm basically recreating the launch with

62
0:03:08.066,000 --> 0:03:12,000
fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw

63
0:03:12.405,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically

64
0:03:15.75,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,

65
0:03:18.567,000 --> 0:03:21,000
what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,

66
0:03:21.748,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that

67
0:03:24.183,000 --> 0:03:25,000
really kind of fascinating.

68
0:03:25.577,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,

69
0:03:28.553,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply

70
0:03:31.762,000 --> 0:03:34,000
take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.

71
0:03:35.332,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And that's simply what I did.

72
0:03:37.335,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,

73
0:03:39.812,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,

74
0:03:43.351,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you know, following the rocket all the way down,

75
0:03:46.183,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately

76
0:03:47.862,000 --> 0:03:5,000
trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.

77
0:03:51.362,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,

78
0:03:53.959,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,

79
0:03:56.964,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and he was there to basically double check my science.

80
0:04:00.483,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.

81
0:04:04.004,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:05.736,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I don't know why, but they thought they did.

83
0:04:08.324,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and

84
0:04:12.466,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself

85
0:04:15.272,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did

86
0:04:17.743,000 --> 0:04:19,000
didn't really suck that bad.

87
0:04:20.152,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little

88
0:04:23.412,000 --> 0:04:25,000
good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed

89
0:04:25.869,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to really check and see what we were doing,

90
0:04:28.406,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and basically give us our A plus report card,

91
0:04:31.392,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and so I showed him some shots we were working on,

92
0:04:33.357,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,

93
0:04:36.467,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)

94
0:04:39.556,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I showed him these two shots,

95
0:04:41.595,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then he basically told me what he thought.

96
0:04:45.012,000 --> 0:04:47,000
("That's wrong") (Laughter)

97
0:04:47.549,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Okay. (Laughter)

98
0:04:50.508,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's what you dream about.

99
0:04:52.432,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:55.432,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,

101
0:04:58.939,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.

102
0:05:02.393,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You would never have a rocket go up

103
0:05:03.642,000 --> 0:05:05,000
while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine

104
0:05:05.703,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the tragedy that could possibly happen with that?

105
0:05:07.758,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You would never, ever design a rocket like that."

106
0:05:10.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know

107
0:05:12.747,000 --> 0:05:14,000
if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot

108
0:05:14.757,000 --> 0:05:15,000
recreating one of America's finest moments with

109
0:05:16.685,000 --> 0:05:17,000
fire extinguishers.

110
0:05:18.344,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:20.703,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,

112
0:05:23.631,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --

113
0:05:25.908,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:27.607,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I'm just going to show you some footage.

115
0:05:29.644,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.

116
0:05:32.254,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.

117
0:05:34.677,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So I showed him this, and this is actual footage

118
0:05:36.716,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.

119
0:05:40.261,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.

120
0:05:45.537,000 --> 0:05:47,000
("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)

121
0:05:48.321,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned

122
0:05:51.555,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in that is that he remembered it differently.

123
0:05:54.037,000 --> 0:05:56,000
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry

124
0:05:56.381,000 --> 0:05:58,000
system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting

125
0:05:59.084,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds

126
0:06:01.307,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of thrust, built by the lowest bidder.

127
0:06:03.581,000 --> 0:06:05,000
He was hoping it was going to work out okay.

128
0:06:05.836,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

129
0:06:08.605,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So he twisted his memory around.

130
0:06:10.749,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not

131
0:06:13.823,000 --> 0:06:15,000
on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking

132
0:06:16.138,000 --> 0:06:18,000
any of this footage, and he just responded

133
0:06:18.364,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as he would respond, and I'll run this.

134
0:06:21.194,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me

135
0:06:23.628,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots

136
0:06:28.066,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find

137
0:06:33.064,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,

138
0:06:35.525,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we generated all that from scratch."

139
0:06:38.943,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"

140
0:06:42.847,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)

141
0:06:46.303,000 --> 0:06:47,000
RL: I think he's a great American.

142
0:06:48.23,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:52.011,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,

144
0:06:55.314,000 --> 0:06:56,000
doesn't end well.

145
0:06:57.054,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:59.835,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.

147
0:07:02.986,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So he basically set up, or basically shattered

148
0:07:05.267,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed

149
0:07:07.67,000 --> 0:07:1,000
was the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually

150
0:07:11.097,000 --> 0:07:13,000
two Mir subs going down to the real wreck,

151
0:07:13.44,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and he created this very haunting footage.

152
0:07:15.477,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these

153
0:07:18.35,000 --> 0:07:2,000
various different emotions, but he couldn't photograph

154
0:07:20.544,000 --> 0:07:22,000
everything, and to tell the story,

155
0:07:23.273,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,

156
0:07:25.123,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because now I have to recreate back to back

157
0:07:27.684,000 --> 0:07:3,000
what really happened and I had, I'm the only one

158
0:07:30.739,000 --> 0:07:34,000
who could really blow it at that point.

159
0:07:35.014,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So this is the footage he photographed,

160
0:07:37.054,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.

161
0:07:41.698,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb

162
0:07:44.195,000 --> 0:07:47,000
this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions

163
0:07:47.396,000 --> 0:07:49,000
when I was looking at it for the very first time.

164
0:07:50.073,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically

165
0:07:54.639,000 --> 0:07:55,000
see it come back to life.

166
0:07:56.024,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I automatically wanted to see this ship,

167
0:07:58.745,000 --> 0:08:,000
this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,

168
0:08:01.408,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,

169
0:08:04.484,000 --> 0:08:06,000
basically go back to what it looks like.

170
0:08:06.932,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you

171
0:08:10.392,000 --> 0:08:12,000
what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,

172
0:08:12.797,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,

173
0:08:16.396,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.

174
0:08:19.992,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found

175
0:08:21.973,000 --> 0:08:23,000
interesting is what we really were emoting to

176
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when you take a look at it.

177
0:08:25.678,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.

178
0:08:28.584,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, when you saw my footage,

179
0:08:30.547,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys

180
0:08:33.19,000 --> 0:08:35,000
flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs

181
0:08:36.187,000 --> 0:08:38,000
are actually about the size of small footballs,

182
0:08:38.792,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and shot in smoke.

183
0:08:40.825,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Jim went three miles went down, and I went about

184
0:08:43.035,000 --> 0:08:44,000
three miles away from the studio

185
0:08:44.633,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and photographed this in a garage.

186
0:08:47.233,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking

187
0:08:49.464,000 --> 0:08:52,000
at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,

188
0:08:52.576,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating

189
0:08:55.817,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,

190
0:09:00.309,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you transfer everything that you feel about it,

191
0:09:03.116,000 --> 0:09:05,000
this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.

192
0:09:05.508,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,

193
0:09:09.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and I found that that was a very interesting thing

194
0:09:11.24,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next

195
0:09:14.035,000 --> 0:09:15,000
effect that I'll show you, which is

196
0:09:15.83,000 --> 0:09:18,000
this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting

197
0:09:19.045,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,

198
0:09:22.998,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so it became a seamless experience for them,

199
0:09:25.65,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,

200
0:09:27.98,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I was showing you what you wanted to see.

201
0:09:30.901,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And the very next shot, right after this --

202
0:09:37.684,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So you can see what I was doing.

203
0:09:39.249,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,

204
0:09:41.043,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?

205
0:09:43.951,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,

206
0:09:45.512,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because he was photographing from the other,

207
0:09:46.783,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.

208
0:09:48.487,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.

209
0:09:51.857,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:58.175,000 --> 0:10:,000
Okay. So now the Titanic transition.

211
0:10:00.514,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically

212
0:10:03.665,000 --> 0:10:05,000
magically transplant from one state of the Titanic

213
0:10:06.582,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)

214
0:10:10.53,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Music)

215
0:10:13.97,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.

216
0:10:25.014,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

217
0:10:29.555,000 --> 0:10:31,000
RL: So, what I did is basically I had another

218
0:10:32.344,000 --> 0:10:34,000
screening room experience where I was basically tracking

219
0:10:35.182,000 --> 0:10:37,000
where I was looking, or where we were looking,

220
0:10:37.484,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow

221
0:10:39.902,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of the ship, and then at some point,

222
0:10:42.095,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'm changing the periphery of the shot,

223
0:10:44.113,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,

224
0:10:46.435,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and then I would run it every day, and then I would find

225
0:10:49.444,000 --> 0:10:52,000
exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them

226
0:10:52.511,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment

227
0:10:54.701,000 --> 0:10:56,000
my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.

228
0:10:57.259,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The moment my eye shifted, I immediately started

229
0:10:59.635,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to change them, so now somehow you missed

230
0:11:01.974,000 --> 0:11:03,000
where it started and where it stopped.

231
0:11:04.314,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And so I'll just show it one more time.

232
0:11:06.467,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains

233
0:11:09.664,000 --> 0:11:12,000
naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift

234
0:11:13.399,000 --> 0:11:14,000
your attention, something changes, and then I left

235
0:11:15.351,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be

236
0:11:17.494,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still

237
0:11:21.347,000 --> 0:11:24,000
on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.

238
0:11:24.677,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Or something like that. I just made that up.

239
0:11:26.686,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:29.155,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.

241
0:11:31.039,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)

242
0:11:34.51,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because

243
0:11:36.792,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the movie itself is about film illusions.

244
0:11:38.902,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence

245
0:11:41.767,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of vision that creates a motion picture,

246
0:11:44.585,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and one of the things I had to do is, we —

247
0:11:48.259,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,

248
0:11:51.586,000 --> 0:11:53,000
comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of

249
0:11:53.737,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted

250
0:11:55.965,000 --> 0:11:58,000
his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.

251
0:11:59.273,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly

252
0:12:01.394,000 --> 0:12:04,000
on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually

253
0:12:04.719,000 --> 0:12:08,000
move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.

254
0:12:09.583,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So let me show you the scene, and then I basically

255
0:12:12.046,000 --> 0:12:15,000
used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,

256
0:12:15.729,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving

257
0:12:18.903,000 --> 0:12:2,000
object, what is not moving appears to be moving,

258
0:12:21.672,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and what is moving appears to be stopped,

259
0:12:24.271,000 --> 0:12:26,000
so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not

260
0:12:27.186,000 --> 0:12:32,000
moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.

261
0:12:32.266,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So this is the shot. That's a little video of

262
0:12:35.297,000 --> 0:12:38,000
what you're looking at there, which is our little test,

263
0:12:38.579,000 --> 0:12:4,000
so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was

264
0:12:41.158,000 --> 0:12:43,000
sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part

265
0:12:43.315,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this

266
0:12:46.64,000 --> 0:12:48,000
sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.

267
0:12:49.158,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented

268
0:12:51.823,000 --> 0:12:55,000
like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,

269
0:12:56.468,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's

270
0:12:58.124,000 --> 0:13:,000
really hard to really get until you actually see it work,

271
0:13:00.505,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,

272
0:13:03.385,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?

273
0:13:05.607,000 --> 0:13:06,000
That doesn't move."

274
0:13:07.56,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

275
0:13:10.978,000 --> 0:13:13,000
"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."

276
0:13:14.954,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Precisely. (Laughter)

277
0:13:17.429,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Brings me to the next, and final --

278
0:13:20.224,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)

279
0:13:24.293,000 --> 0:13:27,000
This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)

280
0:13:28.083,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The next illustration is something that, there's like

281
0:13:32.51,000 --> 0:13:35,000
all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,

282
0:13:35.572,000 --> 0:13:37,000
especially if you're following somebody on a journey,

283
0:13:37.629,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and that journey basically tells something about

284
0:13:39.937,000 --> 0:13:41,000
their personality in a very concise way,

285
0:13:42.178,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"

286
0:13:44.561,000 --> 0:13:45,000
which is one of the great shots ever,

287
0:13:46.445,000 --> 0:13:49,000
a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill

288
0:13:49.822,000 --> 0:13:51,000
through what it feels like to be a gangster walk

289
0:13:51.958,000 --> 0:13:53,000
going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.

290
0:13:54.521,000 --> 0:13:57,000
He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo

291
0:13:58.028,000 --> 0:14:,000
to feel the same way, so we created this shot.

292
0:14:00.684,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Music)

293
0:14:04.001,000 --> 0:14:09,000
That's Hugo. (Music)

294
0:14:09.027,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And we felt that if we could basically move the camera

295
0:14:12.104,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy

296
0:14:14.794,000 --> 0:14:16,000
who is basically the master of his universe,

297
0:14:17.585,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes

298
0:14:20.044,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in the bowels of this particular train station

299
0:14:22.685,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that only he can actually navigate through

300
0:14:24.989,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that

301
0:14:27.288,000 --> 0:14:29,000
this is his normal, everyday sort of life,

302
0:14:29.595,000 --> 0:14:31,000
so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,

303
0:14:32.161,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically

304
0:14:34.777,000 --> 0:14:38,000
it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,

305
0:14:38.788,000 --> 0:14:41,000
so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,

306
0:14:42.31,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got

307
0:14:45.576,000 --> 0:14:46,000
when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.

308
0:14:47.138,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.

309
0:14:50.939,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times

310
0:14:54.124,000 --> 0:14:55,000
with two different boys.

311
0:14:55.311,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The one on the left is where the shot ends,

312
0:14:57.473,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and the shot on the right is where it takes over,

313
0:15:02.899,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,

314
0:15:06.404,000 --> 0:15:09,000
who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)

315
0:15:10.278,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig

316
0:15:12.127,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that we built for this. (Music)

317
0:15:14.591,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And so this is, and now this is set number three

318
0:15:18.142,000 --> 0:15:22,000
we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically

319
0:15:22.522,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the very last moment of the shot is actually

320
0:15:25.186,000 --> 0:15:27,000
the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes

321
0:15:27.468,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and various things like that, and it literally was done

322
0:15:29.513,000 --> 0:15:32,000
over five different sets, two different boys, different times,

323
0:15:32.81,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was

324
0:15:35.64,000 --> 0:15:39,000
sort of great for me was it was probably

325
0:15:40.335,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,

326
0:15:42.852,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,

327
0:15:45.44,000 --> 0:15:49,000
which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.

328
0:15:50.338,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,

329
0:15:53.148,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of

330
0:15:55.072,000 --> 0:15:56,000
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.

331
0:15:56.944,000 --> 0:15:58,000
What do you think was the reason?"

332
0:15:59.855,000 --> 0:16:,000
And he said, "Because no one knows

333
0:16:01.265,000 --> 0:16:02,000
you had anything to do with it."

334
0:16:03.231,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Laughter)

335
0:16:06.037,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So, all I can say is, thank you,

336
0:16:09.951,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)

337
0:16:15.151,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Applause)

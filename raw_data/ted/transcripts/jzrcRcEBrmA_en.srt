1
0:00:13.206,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:14.5,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Herman,

3
0:00:15.73,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I've always been struck by how the most important, impactful,

4
0:00:21.855,000 --> 0:00:24,000
tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society

5
0:00:24.879,000 --> 0:00:25,000
always come from those things

6
0:00:26.633,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that we least think are going to have that impact.

7
0:00:29.601,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I mean, as a computer scientist,

8
0:00:31.188,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms,

9
0:00:34.776,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and depending upon who you ask,

10
0:00:36.999,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it's now involved in toppling elections.

11
0:00:39.872,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I remember when cryptocurrency or automated trading

12
0:00:42.911,000 --> 0:00:44,000
were sort of ideas by a few renegades

13
0:00:45.78,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading,

14
0:00:48.855,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or online, for cryptocurrency,

15
0:00:50.308,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate.

16
0:00:53.328,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I think each of you can recall that moment

17
0:00:55.514,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing,

18
0:00:59.859,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is.

19
0:01:02.764,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected.

20
0:01:06.201,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The reality is that, you know, from my perspective,

21
0:01:10.602,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I think that we're about to encounter that again.

22
0:01:12.927,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I think one of the biggest,

23
0:01:14.467,000 --> 0:01:16,000
most impactful changes in the way we live our lives,

24
0:01:16.927,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to the ways we're educated,

25
0:01:18.268,000 --> 0:01:2,000
probably even to how we end up making an income,

26
0:01:20.855,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is about to come not from AI,

27
0:01:22.45,000 --> 0:01:24,000
not from space travel or biotech --

28
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:26,000
these are all very important future inventions --

29
0:01:27.07,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but in the next five years,

30
0:01:28.538,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I think it's going to come from video games.

31
0:01:34.229,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So that's a bold claim, OK.

32
0:01:35.887,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I see some skeptical faces in the audience.

33
0:01:38.149,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But if we take a moment

34
0:01:39.356,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today,

35
0:01:42.919,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and what just a little bit of technological advancement

36
0:01:46.363,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is about to create,

37
0:01:47.561,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it starts to become more of an inevitability.

38
0:01:49.704,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying.

39
0:01:52.252,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So let's just take a moment to think about scale.

40
0:01:54.571,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I mean, there's already 2.6 billion people who play games.

41
0:01:57.737,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the reality is that's a billion more than five years ago.

42
0:02:00.912,000 --> 0:02:01,000
A billion more people in that time.

43
0:02:02.825,000 --> 0:02:05,000
No religion, no media, nothing has spread like that.

44
0:02:06.325,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And there's likely to be a billion more

45
0:02:08.482,000 --> 0:02:1,000
when Africa and India gain the infrastructure

46
0:02:11.488,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to sort of fully realize the possibilities of gaming.

47
0:02:14.001,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But what I find really special is -- and this often shocks a lot of people --

48
0:02:17.658,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is that the average age of a gamer, like, have a guess, think about it.

49
0:02:21.042,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12.

50
0:02:24.983,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's 34.

51
0:02:26.197,000 --> 0:02:27,000
[Average age of an American gamer]

52
0:02:27.933,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's older than me.

53
0:02:29.577,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And that tells us something,

54
0:02:30.967,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that this isn't entertainment for children anymore.

55
0:02:33.419,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is already a medium like literature or anything else

56
0:02:36.117,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives.

57
0:02:38.406,000 --> 0:02:4,000
One stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming

58
0:02:41.311,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the last sort of 15, 20 years

59
0:02:42.93,000 --> 0:02:43,000
generally don't stop.

60
0:02:44.12,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Something changed in the way that this medium is organized.

61
0:02:46.958,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right?

62
0:02:50.114,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You've heard some examples today,

63
0:02:51.792,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but people are earning an income playing games.

64
0:02:54.53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And not in the obvious ways.

65
0:02:55.904,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes,

66
0:02:57.753,000 --> 0:02:59,000
there's the opportunity to make money in a competitive way.

67
0:03:00.562,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But there's also people earning incomes modding games, building content in them,

68
0:03:04.427,000 --> 0:03:05,000
doing art in them.

69
0:03:05.633,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I mean, there's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance,

70
0:03:09.792,000 --> 0:03:11,000
happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room.

71
0:03:12.205,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And it's being ignored.

72
0:03:14.085,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, what's even more exciting for me is what's about to happen.

73
0:03:17.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And when you think about gaming,

74
0:03:19.324,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you're probably already imagining

75
0:03:20.935,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that it features these massive, infinite worlds,

76
0:03:23.22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but the truth is,

77
0:03:24.395,000 --> 0:03:26,000
games have been deeply limited for a very long time

78
0:03:26.855,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in a way that kind of we in the industry

79
0:03:28.832,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have tried very hard to cover up with as much trickery as possible.

80
0:03:32.022,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment,

81
0:03:35.165,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is the notion of a theater.

82
0:03:36.497,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For the last 10 years,

83
0:03:37.673,000 --> 0:03:4,000
games have massively advanced the visual effects,

84
0:03:41.014,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the physical immersion, the front end of games.

85
0:03:43.68,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But behind the scenes,

86
0:03:45.03,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the actual experiential reality of a game world

87
0:03:48.038,000 --> 0:03:49,000
has remained woefully limited.

88
0:03:49.934,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'll put that in perspective for a moment.

89
0:03:51.998,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I could leave this theater right now,

90
0:03:53.887,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I could do some graffiti, get in a fight, fall in love.

91
0:03:57.085,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I might actually do all of those things after this,

92
0:03:59.506,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but the point is that all of that would have consequence.

93
0:04:02.22,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It would ripple through reality --

94
0:04:03.932,000 --> 0:04:05,000
all of you could interact with that at the same time.

95
0:04:06.44,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It would be persistent.

96
0:04:07.654,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And those are very important qualities to what makes the real world real.

97
0:04:11.204,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, behind the scenes in games,

98
0:04:12.792,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we've had a limit for a very long time.

99
0:04:14.705,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the limit is, behind the visuals,

100
0:04:16.53,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the actual information being exchanged between players or entities

101
0:04:20.491,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in a single game world

102
0:04:21.792,000 --> 0:04:22,000
has been deeply bounded

103
0:04:23.777,000 --> 0:04:26,000
by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server

104
0:04:27.268,000 --> 0:04:28,000
or a single machine.

105
0:04:28.49,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Even The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds.

106
0:04:32.355,000 --> 0:04:34,000
When you hear about concerts in Fortnite,

107
0:04:34.442,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts.

108
0:04:37.391,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You know, individual, as was said earlier today,

109
0:04:39.776,000 --> 0:04:4,000
campfires or couches.

110
0:04:41.695,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together.

111
0:04:44.593,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Let's take a moment to just really understand what that means.

112
0:04:47.568,000 --> 0:04:49,000
When you look at a game, you might see this, beautiful visuals,

113
0:04:50.56,000 --> 0:04:52,000
all of these things happening in front of you.

114
0:04:52.753,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But behind the scenes in an online game,

115
0:04:54.722,000 --> 0:04:55,000
this is what it looks like.

116
0:04:56.049,000 --> 0:04:57,000
To a computer scientist,

117
0:04:57.256,000 --> 0:04:59,000
all you see is just a little bit of information

118
0:04:59.496,000 --> 0:05:02,000
being exchanged by a tiny handful of meaningful entities or objects.

119
0:05:02.779,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You might be thinking, "I've played in an infinite world."

120
0:05:05.857,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well it's more that you've played on a treadmill.

121
0:05:08.279,000 --> 0:05:1,000
As you've been walking through that world,

122
0:05:10.303,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not in to vanish,

123
0:05:14.421,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and the parts of it in front of you to appear.

124
0:05:16.591,000 --> 0:05:18,000
A good trick, but not the basis for the revolution

125
0:05:18.982,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that I promised you in the beginning of this talk.

126
0:05:21.365,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But the reality is, for those of you that are passionate gamers

127
0:05:24.398,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and might be excited about this,

128
0:05:25.964,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and for those of you that are afraid and may not be,

129
0:05:28.442,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all of that is about to change.

130
0:05:29.997,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Because finally, the technology is in place

131
0:05:32.077,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to go well beyond the limits that we've previously seen.

132
0:05:34.809,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I've dedicated my career to this,

133
0:05:36.438,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there are many others working on the problem --

134
0:05:38.66,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'd hardly take credit for it myself,

135
0:05:40.487,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but we're at the point now where we can finally

136
0:05:42.735,000 --> 0:05:43,000
do this impossible hard thing

137
0:05:44.471,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of weaving together thousands of disparate machines

138
0:05:47.487,000 --> 0:05:48,000
into single simulations

139
0:05:49.188,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that are convenient enough to not be one-offs,

140
0:05:51.681,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but to be buildable by anybody.

141
0:05:53.346,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And to be at the point

142
0:05:54.554,000 --> 0:05:57,000
where we can start to experience those things that we can't yet fathom.

143
0:05:57.928,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Let's just take a moment to visualize that.

144
0:06:00.121,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I'm talking about not individual little simulations

145
0:06:03.027,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but a massive possibility of huge networks of interaction.

146
0:06:07.103,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Massive global events that can happen inside that.

147
0:06:09.476,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Things that even in the real world

148
0:06:11.126,000 --> 0:06:13,000
become challenging to produce at that kind of scale.

149
0:06:13.593,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I know some of you are gamers,

150
0:06:15.315,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so I'm going to show you some footage of some things

151
0:06:17.864,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do, from some of our partners.

152
0:06:21.03,000 --> 0:06:22,000
TED and me had a back-and-forth on this.

153
0:06:22.983,000 --> 0:06:24,000
These are a few things that not many people have seen before,

154
0:06:25.897,000 --> 0:06:27,000
some new experiences powered by this type of technology.

155
0:06:28.605,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'll just [take] a moment to show you some of this stuff.

156
0:06:31.354,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is a single game world

157
0:06:32.689,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict.

158
0:06:36.346,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It also has its own ecosystem,

159
0:06:39.45,000 --> 0:06:4,000
its own sense of predator and prey.

160
0:06:41.205,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Every single object you see here is simulated in some way.

161
0:06:44.038,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world,

162
0:06:47.469,000 --> 0:06:48,000
NetEase, a huge Chinese company.

163
0:06:49.072,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And they've made an assistant creative simulation

164
0:06:51.445,000 --> 0:06:53,000
where groups of players can cocreate together,

165
0:06:53.739,000 --> 0:06:54,000
across multiple devices,

166
0:06:54.934,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in a world that doesn't vanish when you're done.

167
0:06:57.229,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's a place to tell stories and have adventures.

168
0:06:59.622,000 --> 0:07:,000
Even the weather is simulated.

169
0:07:01.086,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And that's kind of awesome.

170
0:07:02.882,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And this is my personal favorite.

171
0:07:04.51,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This is a group of people, pioneers in Berlin,

172
0:07:06.692,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a group called Klang Games,

173
0:07:08.025,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and they're completely insane, and they'll love me for saying that.

174
0:07:11.215,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And they found a way to model, basically, an entire planet.

175
0:07:14.001,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They're going to have a simulation with millions of non-player characters

176
0:07:17.492,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and players engaging.

177
0:07:18.725,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They actually grabbed Lawrence Lessig

178
0:07:20.584,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to help understand the political ramifications

179
0:07:22.758,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of the world they're creating.

180
0:07:24.266,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is the sort of astounding set of experiences,

181
0:07:26.656,000 --> 0:07:27,000
well beyond what we might have imagined,

182
0:07:28.648,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that are now going to be possible.

183
0:07:30.323,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And that's just the first step in this technology.

184
0:07:32.712,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So if we step beyond that, what happens?

185
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Well, computer science tends to be all exponential,

186
0:07:38.568,000 --> 0:07:39,000
once we crack the really hard problems.

187
0:07:40.457,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And I'm pretty sure that very soon,

188
0:07:42.171,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we're going to be in a place where we can make

189
0:07:44.402,000 --> 0:07:46,000
this type of computational power look like nothing.

190
0:07:46.807,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And when that happens, the opportunities ...

191
0:07:49.911,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's worth taking a moment to try to imagine what I'm talking about here.

192
0:07:53.389,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Hundreds of thousands or millions of people

193
0:07:55.489,000 --> 0:07:56,000
being able to coinhabit the same space.

194
0:07:57.379,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The last time any of us as a species

195
0:07:59.737,000 --> 0:08:01,000
had the opportunity to build or do something together

196
0:08:02.27,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with that may people was in antiquity.

197
0:08:04.478,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And the circumstances were less than optimal, shall we say.

198
0:08:08.064,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Mostly conflicts or building pyramids.

199
0:08:10.105,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Not necessarily the best thing for us to be spending our time doing.

200
0:08:13.367,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But if you bring together that many people,

201
0:08:15.411,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the kind of shared experience that can create ...

202
0:08:18.363,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I think it exercises a social muscle in us

203
0:08:21.228,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we've lost and forgotten.

204
0:08:22.895,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Going even beyond that,

205
0:08:24.101,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I want to take a moment to think about what it means

206
0:08:26.577,000 --> 0:08:27,000
for relationships, for identity.

207
0:08:28.136,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If we can give each other worlds, experiences at scale

208
0:08:31.112,000 --> 0:08:33,000
where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time,

209
0:08:33.546,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we can change what it means to be an individual.

210
0:08:35.847,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We can go beyond a single identity

211
0:08:37.506,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to a diverse set of personal identities.

212
0:08:40.006,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The gender, the race, the personality traits you were born with

213
0:08:43.807,000 --> 0:08:46,000
might be something you want to experiment differently with.

214
0:08:46.926,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You might be someone that wants to be more than one person.

215
0:08:49.736,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We all are, inside, multiple people.

216
0:08:51.823,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We rarely get the opportunity to flex that.

217
0:08:53.982,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's also about empathy.

218
0:08:55.457,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I have a grandmother

219
0:08:56.641,000 --> 0:08:58,000
who I have literally nothing in common with.

220
0:08:58.72,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I love her to bits,

221
0:08:59.919,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but every story she has begins in 1940 and ends sometime in 1950.

222
0:09:03.921,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And every story I have is like 50 years later.

223
0:09:06.292,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But if we could coinhabit,

224
0:09:07.804,000 --> 0:09:08,000
co-experience things together,

225
0:09:09.688,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context,

226
0:09:12.545,000 --> 0:09:13,000
create opportunities together,

227
0:09:14.244,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that changes things, that bonds people in different ways.

228
0:09:17.315,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many differences,

229
0:09:21.538,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and really made us more who we are in the presence of other people.

230
0:09:24.722,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I think games could really start to create

231
0:09:27.198,000 --> 0:09:28,000
an opportunity for us to empathize again.

232
0:09:29.175,000 --> 0:09:31,000
To have shared adversity, shared opportunity.

233
0:09:31.421,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I mean, statistically, at this moment in time,

234
0:09:33.913,000 --> 0:09:36,000
there are people who are on the opposite sides of a conflict,

235
0:09:37.676,000 --> 0:09:39,000
who have been matchmade together into a game

236
0:09:40.033,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and don't even know it.

237
0:09:41.826,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's an incredible opportunity to change the way we look at things.

238
0:09:45.121,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Finally, for those of you who perhaps are more cynical about all of this,

239
0:09:48.584,000 --> 0:09:51,000
who maybe don't think that virtual worlds and games are your cup of tea.

240
0:09:52.001,000 --> 0:09:53,000
There's a reality you have to accept,

241
0:09:53.81,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and that is that the economic impact of what I'm talking about

242
0:09:56.763,000 --> 0:09:57,000
will be profound.

243
0:09:57.945,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Right now, thousands of people have full-time jobs in gaming.

244
0:10:00.844,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Soon, it will be millions of people.

245
0:10:03.609,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Wherever there's a mobile phone, there will be a job.

246
0:10:06.173,000 --> 0:10:08,000
An opportunity for something that is creative and rich

247
0:10:09.093,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and gives you an income, no matter what country you're in,

248
0:10:11.847,000 --> 0:10:14,000
no matter what skills or opportunities you might think you have.

249
0:10:15.244,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Probably the first dollar most kids born today make

250
0:10:17.911,000 --> 0:10:18,000
might be in a game.

251
0:10:19.117,000 --> 0:10:2,000
That will be the new paper route,

252
0:10:20.752,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that will be the new opportunity for an income

253
0:10:22.951,000 --> 0:10:23,000
at the earliest time in your life.

254
0:10:24.598,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So I kind of want to end with almost a plea,

255
0:10:28.486,000 --> 0:10:29,000
really, more than thoughts.

256
0:10:30.836,000 --> 0:10:32,000
A sense of, I think, how we need to face this new opportunity

257
0:10:33.735,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a little differently to some we have in the past.

258
0:10:36.102,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's so hypocritical for yet another technologist

259
0:10:38.458,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to stand up on stage and say,

260
0:10:39.888,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"The future will be great, technology will fix it."

261
0:10:42.305,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And the reality is, this is going to have downsides.

262
0:10:44.828,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But those downsides will only be amplified

263
0:10:46.998,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if we approach, once again, with cynicism and derision,

264
0:10:50.395,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the opportunities that this presents.

265
0:10:52.252,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The worst thing that we could possibly do

266
0:10:54.323,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is let the same four or five companies

267
0:10:56.342,000 --> 0:10:58,000
end up dominating yet another adjacent space.

268
0:10:59.363,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

269
0:11:01.752,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Because they're not just going to define how and who makes money from this.

270
0:11:05.942,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The reality is, we're now talking about defining how we think,

271
0:11:09.902,000 --> 0:11:11,000
what the rules are around identity and collaboration,

272
0:11:12.522,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the rules of the world we live in.

273
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This has got to be something we all own,

274
0:11:16.18,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we all cocreate.

275
0:11:17.807,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, my final plea is really to those engineers,

276
0:11:20.823,000 --> 0:11:23,000
those scientists, those artists in the audience today.

277
0:11:24.085,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Maybe some of you dreamed of working on space travel.

278
0:11:27.18,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The reality is, there are worlds you can build right here, right now,

279
0:11:30.696,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that can transform people's lives.

280
0:11:32.696,000 --> 0:11:34,000
There are still huge technological frontiers

281
0:11:35.403,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that need to be overcome here,

282
0:11:36.871,000 --> 0:11:38,000
akin to those we faced when building the early internet.

283
0:11:39.53,000 --> 0:11:41,000
All the technology behind virtual worlds is different.

284
0:11:42.125,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So, my plea to you is this.

285
0:11:43.761,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Let's engage, let's all engage,

286
0:11:45.928,000 --> 0:11:48,000
let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way,

287
0:11:49.778,000 --> 0:11:52,000
rather than once again have be done to us.

288
0:11:52.817,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you.

289
0:11:53.992,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Applause)

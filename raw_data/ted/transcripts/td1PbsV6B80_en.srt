1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I grew up in New York City,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
between Harlem and the Bronx.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Growing up as a boy, we were taught

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
had to be courageous, dominating --

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
no pain, no emotions,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with the exception of anger --

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and definitely no fear;

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that men are in charge,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which means women are not;

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that men lead,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and you should just follow and do what we say;

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that men are superior; women are inferior;

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that men are strong; women are weak;

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that women are of less value,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
property of men,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and objects,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
particularly sexual objects.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I've later come to know that to be

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the collective socialization of men,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
better known

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as the "man box."

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
See this man box has in it

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
all the ingredients

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of how we define what it means to be a man.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
there are some wonderful, wonderful,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
absolutely wonderful things

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
about being a man.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But at the same time,

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there's some stuff

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that's just straight up twisted,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and we really need to begin

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to challenge, look at it

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and really get in the process

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of deconstructing, redefining,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
what we come to know as manhood.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They're 11 and 12.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Kendall and Jay.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And when they were about five and six,

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
four and five,

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Jay could come to me,

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
come to me crying.

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It didn't matter what she was crying about,

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
just cry, cry it out.

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.

53
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now Kendall on the other hand --

54
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
he'd come to me crying,

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a clock would go off.

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,

59
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which means, by the time he got to me,

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Hold your head up. Look at me.

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Explain to me what's wrong.

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Why are you crying?"

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And out of my own frustration

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of my role and responsibility

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of building him up as a man

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to fit into these guidelines

69
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and these structures that are defining this man box,

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I would find myself saying things like,

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"Just go in your room.

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Just go on, go on in your room.

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Sit down,

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
get yourself together

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and come back and talk to me

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when you can talk to me like a --" what?

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Audience: Man.)

78
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Like a man.

79
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And he's five years old.

80
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And as I grow in life,

81
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I would say to myself,

82
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"My God, what's wrong with me?

83
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"

84
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I think back.

85
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I think back to my father.

86
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There was a time in my life

87
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.

88
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
My brother, Henry, he died tragically

89
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when we were teenagers.

90
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We lived in New York City, as I said.

91
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We lived in the Bronx at the time,

92
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,

93
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it was about two hours outside of the city.

94
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And as we were preparing

95
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to come back from the burial,

96
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the cars stopped at the bathroom

97
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to let folks take care of themselves

98
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
before the long ride back to the city.

99
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the limousine empties out.

100
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,

101
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,

102
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and no sooner than the women got out,

103
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
he burst out crying.

104
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He didn't want cry in front of me,

105
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,

106
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and it was better me than to allow himself

107
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.

108
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And this is a man

109
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who, 10 minutes ago,

110
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
had just put his teenage son

111
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the ground --

112
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
something I just can't even imagine.

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The thing that sticks with me the most

114
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is that he was apologizing to me

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for crying in front of me,

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,

117
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
lifting me up,

118
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for not crying.

119
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I come to also look at this

120
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as this fear that we have as men,

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
this fear that just has us paralyzed,

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
holding us hostage

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to this man box.

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I can remember speaking

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and I asked him, I said,

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"How would you feel if,

128
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in front of all the players,

129
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now I expected him to say something like,

131
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.

132
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
No, the boy said to me --

133
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the boy said to me,

134
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"It would destroy me."

135
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And I said to myself,

136
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"God, if it would destroy him

137
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to be called a girl,

138
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
what are we then teaching him

139
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about girls?"

140
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

141
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It took me back to a time

142
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
when I was about 12 years old.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
At this time we're living in the Bronx,

145
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.

146
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He was about 16 years old,

147
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.

148
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.

149
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.

150
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,

151
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"

152
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.

153
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He was a troubled kid.

154
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.

155
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
He was being raised by his grandmother.

156
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
His father wasn't on the set.

157
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
His grandmother had two jobs.

158
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He was home alone a lot.

159
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,

160
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we looked up to this dude, man.

161
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He was cool. He was fine.

162
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."

163
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He was having sex.

164
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We all looked up to him.

165
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --

166
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.

167
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."

168
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.

169
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."

170
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Johnny call, you go.

171
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I run right upstairs.

172
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"

173
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now I immediately knew what he meant.

174
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Because for me growing up at that time,

175
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and our relationship with this man box,

176
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:

177
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
sex or drugs --

178
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and we weren't doing drugs.

179
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Now my box, my card,

180
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
my man box card,

181
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
was immediately in jeopardy.

182
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Two things: One, I never had sex.

183
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We don't talk about that as men.

184
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,

185
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the first time you had sex.

186
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.

187
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
There ain't no first time.

188
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

189
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.

190
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.

191
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Women are objects,

192
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
especially sexual objects.

193
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.

194
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,

195
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."

196
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
He told me to go in his room.

197
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.

198
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
She's 16 years old.

199
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
She's nude.

200
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,

201
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
higher-functioning at times than others.

202
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.

203
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.

204
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.

205
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Because, while Sheila never said no,

206
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
she also never said yes.

207
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.

208
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So when I go in the room, I close the door.

209
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Folks, I'm petrified.

210
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room

211
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and see that I'm not doing anything,

212
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.

213
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;

214
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.

215
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So in my 12 years of wisdom,

216
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I zip my pants down,

217
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I walk out into the room,

218
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and lo and behold to me,

219
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
while I was in the room with Sheila,

220
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

221
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So now there's a living room full of guys.

222
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.

223
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And they asked me how was it,

224
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I say to them, "It was good,"

225
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I zip my pants up in front of them,

226
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and I head for the door.

227
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now I say this all with remorse,

228
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,

229
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,

230
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because I didn't get caught.

231
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.

232
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This fear, getting outside the man box,

233
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
totally enveloped me.

234
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It was way more important to me,

235
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
about me and my man box card

236
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
than about Sheila

237
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and what was happening to her.

238
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
See collectively, we as men

239
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are taught to have less value in women,

240
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to view them as property and the objects of men.

241
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.

242
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We as men, good men,

243
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the large majority of men,

244
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we operate on the foundation

245
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of this whole collective socialization.

246
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.

247
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
You see, we have to come to understand

248
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation

249
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and the violence can't happen without it.

250
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So we're very much a part of the solution

251
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
as well as the problem.

252
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The center for disease control says

253
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,

254
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is the number one health concern for women

255
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in this country and abroad.

256
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So quickly, I'd like to just say,

257
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

258
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The world I envision for her --

259
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?

260
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I need you on board. I need you with me.

261
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I need you working with me and me working with you

262
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
on how we raise our sons

263
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and teach them to be men --

264
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that it's okay to not be dominating,

265
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,

266
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that it's okay to promote equality,

267
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,

268
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that it's okay to be whole,

269
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that my liberation as a man

270
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)

271
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,

272
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I asked a nine-year-old boy,

273
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"What would life be like for you,

274
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"

275
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
He said to me, "I would be free."

276
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you folks.

277
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Applause)

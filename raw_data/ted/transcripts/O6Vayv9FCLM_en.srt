1
0:00:13.028,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As you've probably noticed,

2
0:00:14.755,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in recent years, a lot of western forests have burned

3
0:00:17.956,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in large and destructive wildfires.

4
0:00:22.84,000 --> 0:00:23,000
If you're like me --

5
0:00:24.087,000 --> 0:00:28,000
this western landscape is actually why my family and I live here.

6
0:00:29.558,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And as a scientist and a father,

7
0:00:31.872,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've become deeply concerned about what we're leaving behind

8
0:00:35.967,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for our kids, and now my five grandkids.

9
0:00:40.756,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In the US, an area that's larger than the state of Oregon has burned

10
0:00:45.653,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in just the last 10 years,

11
0:00:48.342,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed.

12
0:00:53.098,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Acres burned and homes destroyed have steadily increased

13
0:00:57.886,000 --> 0:00:59,000
over the last three decades,

14
0:01:02.328,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and individual fires that are bigger than 100,000 acres --

15
0:01:07.808,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they're actually on the rise.

16
0:01:09.46,000 --> 0:01:11,000
These are what we call "megafires."

17
0:01:13.229,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Megafires are the result of the way we've managed this western landscape

18
0:01:18.023,000 --> 0:01:2,000
over the last 150 years

19
0:01:20.663,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in a steadily warming climate.

20
0:01:23.89,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Much of the destruction that we are currently seeing

21
0:01:27.6,000 --> 0:01:28,000
could actually have been avoided.

22
0:01:30.616,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I've spent my entire career studying these western landscapes,

23
0:01:34.162,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the science is pretty clear:

24
0:01:36.911,000 --> 0:01:4,000
if we don't change a few of our fire-management habits,

25
0:01:41.996,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we're going to lose many more of our beloved forests.

26
0:01:46.062,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Some won't recover in our lifetime

27
0:01:49.411,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or my kids' lifetime.

28
0:01:51.603,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's time we confront some tough truths about wildfires,

29
0:01:56.006,000 --> 0:02:,000
and come to understand that we need to learn to better live with them

30
0:02:01.162,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and change how they come to our forests,

31
0:02:04.829,000 --> 0:02:05,000
our homes

32
0:02:07.047,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and our communities.

33
0:02:09.654,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So why is this happening?

34
0:02:11.508,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Well, that's what I want to talk to you about today.

35
0:02:16.18,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You see this forest?

36
0:02:20.536,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Isn't it beautiful?

37
0:02:29.877,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, the forests that we see today

38
0:02:33.108,000 --> 0:02:38,000
look nothing like the forests of 100 or 150 years ago.

39
0:02:39.318,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Thankfully, panoramic photos were taken in the 1930s

40
0:02:43.005,000 --> 0:02:46,000
from thousands of western mountaintop lookouts,

41
0:02:46.917,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they show a fair approximation

42
0:02:49.38,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of the forest that we inherited.

43
0:02:52.441,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The best word to describe these forests of old is "patchy."

44
0:02:57.303,000 --> 0:03:,000
The historical forest landscape was this constantly evolving patchwork

45
0:03:01.325,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of open and closed canopy forests of all ages,

46
0:03:05.108,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and there was so much evidence of fire.

47
0:03:09.759,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And most fires were pretty small by today's standards.

48
0:03:14.07,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And it's important to understand that this landscape was open,

49
0:03:18.102,000 --> 0:03:2,000
with meadows and open canopy forests,

50
0:03:20.648,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it was the grasses of the meadows

51
0:03:22.948,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and in the grassy understories of the open forest

52
0:03:26.444,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that many of the wildfires were carried.

53
0:03:31.797,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There were other forces at work, too, shaping this historical patchwork:

54
0:03:35.883,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for example, topography, whether a place faces north or south

55
0:03:39.727,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or it's on a ridge top or in a valley bottom;

56
0:03:42.449,000 --> 0:03:44,000
elevation, how far up the mountain it is;

57
0:03:45.318,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and weather, whether a place gets a lot of snow and rain,

58
0:03:49.938,000 --> 0:03:51,000
sunlight and warmth.

59
0:03:52.01,000 --> 0:03:55,000
These things all worked together

60
0:03:55.103,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to shape the way the forest grew.

61
0:03:57.974,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the way the forest grew shaped the way fire behaved

62
0:04:03.163,000 --> 0:04:04,000
on the landscape.

63
0:04:05.431,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There was crosstalk between the patterns and the processes.

64
0:04:10.704,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You can see the new dry forest.

65
0:04:12.625,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Trees were open grown and fairly far apart.

66
0:04:15.851,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Fires were frequent here, and when they occurred,

67
0:04:18.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
they weren't that severe,

68
0:04:19.922,000 --> 0:04:2,000
while further up the mountain,

69
0:04:21.376,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in the moist and the cold forests,

70
0:04:23.523,000 --> 0:04:26,000
trees were more densely grown and fires were less frequent,

71
0:04:26.785,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but when they occurred, they were quite a bit more severe.

72
0:04:30.127,000 --> 0:04:33,000
These different forest types, the environments that they grew in

73
0:04:33.794,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and fire severity -- they all worked together

74
0:04:36.881,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to shape this historical patchwork.

75
0:04:40.429,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And there was so much power

76
0:04:43.837,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in this patchwork.

77
0:04:45.904,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It provided a natural mechanism

78
0:04:48.455,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to resist the spread of future fires across the landscape.

79
0:04:53.002,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Once a patch of forest burned,

80
0:04:55.172,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it helped to prevent the flow of fire across the landscape.

81
0:04:59.046,000 --> 0:05:,000
A way to think about it is,

82
0:05:00.561,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the burned patches helped the rest of the forest

83
0:05:05.148,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to be forest.

84
0:05:08.677,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Let's add humans to the mix.

85
0:05:11.144,000 --> 0:05:14,000
For 10,000 years, Native Americans lived on this landscape,

86
0:05:14.893,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and they intentionally burned it -- a lot.

87
0:05:19.284,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They used fire to burn meadows and to thin certain forests

88
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
so they could grow more food.

89
0:05:25.269,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They used fire to increase graze

90
0:05:28.298,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for the deer and the elk and the bison that they hunted.

91
0:05:32.158,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And most importantly, they figured out

92
0:05:34.695,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if they burned in the spring and the fall,

93
0:05:37.345,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they could avoid the out-of-control fires of summer.

94
0:05:41.508,000 --> 0:05:45,000
European settlement -- it occurred much later, in the mid-1800s,

95
0:05:46.016,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and by the 1880s, livestock grazing was in high gear.

96
0:05:50.315,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I mean, if you think about it, the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses

97
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which had been the conveyer belt for the historical fires,

98
0:05:58.185,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and this prevented once-frequent fires from thinning out trees

99
0:06:02.303,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and burning up dead wood.

100
0:06:04.634,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Later came roads and railroads, and they acted as potent firebreaks,

101
0:06:09.737,000 --> 0:06:12,000
interrupting further the flow of fire across this landscape.

102
0:06:13.733,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And then something happened which caused a sudden pivot

103
0:06:17.617,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in our society.

104
0:06:19.489,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In 1910, we had a huge wildfire.

105
0:06:23.586,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was the size of the state of Connecticut.

106
0:06:27.275,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We called it "the Big Burn."

107
0:06:29.939,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It stretched from eastern Washington to western Montana,

108
0:06:33.912,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and it burned, in a few days, three million acres,

109
0:06:37.619,000 --> 0:06:41,000
devoured several towns, and it killed 87 people.

110
0:06:42.104,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Most of them were firefighters.

111
0:06:45.178,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Because of the Big Burn, wildfire became public enemy number one,

112
0:06:49.185,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and this would shape the way that we would think about wildfire

113
0:06:52.63,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in our society

114
0:06:53.935,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for the next hundred years.

115
0:06:56.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thereafter, the Forest Service, just five years young at the time,

116
0:07:00.335,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was tasked with the responsibility of putting out all wildfires

117
0:07:05.491,000 --> 0:07:08,000
on 193 million acres of public lands,

118
0:07:09.057,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and they took this responsibility

119
0:07:11.021,000 --> 0:07:12,000
very seriously.

120
0:07:12.872,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They developed this unequaled ability to put fires out,

121
0:07:16.846,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and they put out 95 to 98 percent

122
0:07:20.122,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of all fires every single year in the US.

123
0:07:25.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And from this point on, it was now fire suppression

124
0:07:29.387,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and not wildfires

125
0:07:30.941,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that would become a prime shaper of our forests.

126
0:07:35.943,000 --> 0:07:38,000
After World War II, timber harvesting got going in the west,

127
0:07:39.467,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the logging removed the large and the old trees.

128
0:07:42.614,000 --> 0:07:47,000
These were survivors of centuries of wildfires.

129
0:07:47.919,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And the forest filled in.

130
0:07:49.875,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Thin-barked, fire-sensitive small trees filled in the gaps,

131
0:07:54.82,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and our forests became dense, with trees so layered and close together

132
0:08:00.79,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that they were touching each other.

133
0:08:03.357,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So fires were unintentionally blocked by roads and railroads,

134
0:08:07.299,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the cattle and sheep ate the grass,

135
0:08:09.758,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then along comes fire suppression and logging, removing the big trees,

136
0:08:14.102,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and you know what happened?

137
0:08:15.451,000 --> 0:08:17,000
All these factors worked together

138
0:08:17.729,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to allow the forest to fill in,

139
0:08:20.638,000 --> 0:08:23,000
creating what I call the current epidemic of trees.

140
0:08:25.163,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

141
0:08:28.678,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Go figure.

142
0:08:29.878,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:30.949,000 --> 0:08:33,000
More trees than the landscape can support.

144
0:08:35.506,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So when you compare what forests looked like 100 years ago and today,

145
0:08:40.29,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the change is actually remarkable.

146
0:08:42.8,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Notice how the patchwork has filled in.

147
0:08:45.234,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Dry south slopes --

148
0:08:46.806,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they're now covered with trees.

149
0:08:49.843,000 --> 0:08:51,000
A patchwork that was once sculptured by mostly small

150
0:08:52.846,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and sort of medium-sized fires

151
0:08:54.628,000 --> 0:08:55,000
has filled in.

152
0:08:56.145,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Do you see the blanket of trees?

153
0:08:58.679,000 --> 0:09:,000
After just 150 years,

154
0:09:00.974,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we have a dense carpet of forest.

155
0:09:03.555,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But there's more.

156
0:09:05.312,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Because trees are growing so close together,

157
0:09:08.291,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and because tree species, tree sizes and ages

158
0:09:11.643,000 --> 0:09:14,000
are so similar across large areas,

159
0:09:15.314,000 --> 0:09:18,000
fires not only move easily from acre to acre,

160
0:09:18.365,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but now, so do diseases and insect outbreaks,

161
0:09:23.896,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which are killing or reducing the vitality

162
0:09:27.248,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of really large sections of forest now.

163
0:09:30.488,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And after a century without fire,

164
0:09:33.371,000 --> 0:09:36,000
dead branches and downed trees on the forest floor,

165
0:09:36.974,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they're at powder-keg levels.

166
0:09:39.956,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What's more, our summers are getting hotter

167
0:09:42.605,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and they're getting drier

168
0:09:44.784,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they're getting windier.

169
0:09:47.163,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And the fire season is now 40 to 80 days longer each year.

170
0:09:53.168,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Because of this, climatologists are predicting

171
0:09:55.692,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that the area burned since 2000

172
0:09:58.936,000 --> 0:10:,000
will double or triple

173
0:10:01.745,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in the next three decades.

174
0:10:05.015,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And we're building houses in the middle of this.

175
0:10:08.413,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Two recently published studies tell us

176
0:10:10.546,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that more than 60 percent of all new housing starts are being built

177
0:10:15.107,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in this flammable and dangerous mess.

178
0:10:19.145,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So when we do get a fire,

179
0:10:21.722,000 --> 0:10:25,000
large areas can literally go up in smoke.

180
0:10:28.363,000 --> 0:10:29,000
How do you feel now

181
0:10:31.58,000 --> 0:10:32,000
about the forest image

182
0:10:34.07,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that I first showed you?

183
0:10:35.773,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It scares the heck out of me.

184
0:10:39.729,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So what do we do?

185
0:10:42.01,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We need to restore the power of the patchwork.

186
0:10:45.544,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We need to put the right kind of fire

187
0:10:48.717,000 --> 0:10:49,000
back into the system again.

188
0:10:50.643,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's how we can resize the severity of many of our future fires.

189
0:10:57.277,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And the silver lining is that we have tools

190
0:10:59.77,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and we have know-how to do this.

191
0:11:02.268,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Let's look at some of the tools.

192
0:11:04.431,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We can use prescribed burning to intentionally thin out trees

193
0:11:09.222,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and burn up dead fuels.

194
0:11:11.74,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We do this to systematically reduce them and keep them reduced.

195
0:11:16.785,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And what is that going to do?

196
0:11:18.191,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's going to create already-burned patches on the landscape

197
0:11:21.089,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that will resist the flow of future fires.

198
0:11:24.389,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We can combine mechanical thinning with some of these treatments

199
0:11:27.725,000 --> 0:11:28,000
where it's appropriate to do so,

200
0:11:29.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and capture some commercial value

201
0:11:31.238,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and perhaps underwrite some of these treatments,

202
0:11:34.193,000 --> 0:11:36,000
especially around urban areas.

203
0:11:36.766,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And the best news of all is that prescribed burning produces

204
0:11:40.021,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so much less smoke than wildfires do.

205
0:11:43.701,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's not even close.

206
0:11:45.074,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But there's a hitch:

207
0:11:46.962,000 --> 0:11:5,000
prescribed burning smoke is currently regulated under air quality rules

208
0:11:51.975,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as an avoidable nuisance.

209
0:11:54.557,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But wildfire smoke?

210
0:11:56.262,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It simply gets a pass.

211
0:12:00.153,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs)

212
0:12:02.742,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So you know what happens?

213
0:12:04.041,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We do far too little prescribed burning,

214
0:12:07.312,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and we continually eat smoke in the summers

215
0:12:11.147,000 --> 0:12:12,000
from megafires.

216
0:12:12.572,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We all need to work together to get this changed.

217
0:12:16.711,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And finally, there's managed wildfires.

218
0:12:18.696,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Instead of putting all the fires out,

219
0:12:21.903,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we need to put some of them back to work

220
0:12:24.456,000 --> 0:12:26,000
thinning forests and reducing dead fuels.

221
0:12:28.005,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We can herd them around the landscape

222
0:12:30.696,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when it's appropriate to do so

223
0:12:32.633,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to help restore the power of the patchwork.

224
0:12:38.623,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And as you've probably figured out by now,

225
0:12:42.386,000 --> 0:12:44,000
this is actually a social problem.

226
0:12:44.616,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's got ecological and climate explanations,

227
0:12:47.623,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but it's a social problem, and it will take us humans to solve it.

228
0:12:53.026,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Public support for these tools is poor.

229
0:12:55.482,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Prescribed burning and managed wildfires are not well-supported.

230
0:12:59.188,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We actually all simply want fires to magically go away

231
0:13:04.455,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and take that pesky smoke with them, don't we?

232
0:13:09.122,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But there is no future without lots of fire and lots of smoke.

233
0:13:14.174,000 --> 0:13:16,000
That option is actually not on the table.

234
0:13:19.038,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Until we, the owners of public lands, make it our high priority

235
0:13:24.243,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to do something about the current situation,

236
0:13:28.002,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we're going to experience continued losses to megafires.

237
0:13:31.647,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So it's up to us.

238
0:13:33.569,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We can spread this message to our lawmakers,

239
0:13:36.312,000 --> 0:13:39,000
folks who can help us manage our fires

240
0:13:40.265,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and our forests.

241
0:13:45.68,000 --> 0:13:46,000
If we're unsuccessful,

242
0:13:49.19,000 --> 0:13:51,000
where will you go to play

243
0:13:52.14,000 --> 0:13:54,000
when your favorite places are burned black?

244
0:13:57.096,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Where will you go

245
0:13:59.298,000 --> 0:14:,000
to breathe deep

246
0:14:02.052,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and slow?

247
0:14:04.08,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Thank you.

248
0:14:05.278,000 --> 0:14:09,000
(Applause)

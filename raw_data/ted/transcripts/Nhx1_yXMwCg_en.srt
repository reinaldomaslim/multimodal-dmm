1
0:00:12.397,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When we talk about corruption,

2
0:00:14.852,000 --> 0:00:17,000
there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.

3
0:00:18.322,000 --> 0:00:2,000
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.

4
0:00:20.65,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.

5
0:00:23.839,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Until his death in 2006,

6
0:00:25.827,000 --> 0:00:28,000
he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan,

7
0:00:29.133,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a Central Asian country rich in natural gas.

8
0:00:32.898,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.

9
0:00:36.848,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And one renamed the months of the year

10
0:00:39.093,000 --> 0:00:42,000
including after himself and his mother.

11
0:00:42.243,000 --> 0:00:44,000
He spent millions of dollars

12
0:00:44.277,000 --> 0:00:46,000
creating a bizarre personality cult,

13
0:00:47.097,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and his crowning glory was the building

14
0:00:49.066,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself

15
0:00:53.106,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which stood proudly in the capital's central square

16
0:00:56.17,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and rotated to follow the sun.

17
0:00:59.162,000 --> 0:01:01,000
He was a slightly unusual guy.

18
0:01:01.935,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And then there's that cliché,

19
0:01:03.792,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the African dictator or minister or official.

20
0:01:07.191,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There's Teodorín Obiang.

21
0:01:10.302,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea,

22
0:01:14.533,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a West African nation that has exported

23
0:01:17.657,000 --> 0:01:2,000
billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s

24
0:01:21.138,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and yet has a truly appalling human rights record.

25
0:01:25.182,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The vast majority of its people

26
0:01:27.076,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are living in really miserable poverty

27
0:01:30.031,000 --> 0:01:32,000
despite an income per capita that's on a par

28
0:01:32.151,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with that of Portugal.

29
0:01:34.649,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself

30
0:01:37.354,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.

31
0:01:41.786,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I've been up to its front gates.

32
0:01:42.887,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.

33
0:01:45.982,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He bought an €18 million art collection

34
0:01:49.701,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent,

35
0:01:53.84,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a stack of fabulous sports cars,

36
0:01:55.388,000 --> 0:01:57,000
some costing a million dollars apiece --

37
0:01:57.943,000 --> 0:01:59,000
oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.

38
0:02:00.259,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now get this:

39
0:02:01.62,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Until recently, he was earning an official monthly salary

40
0:02:05.761,000 --> 0:02:09,000
of less than 7,000 dollars.

41
0:02:09.915,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And there's Dan Etete.

42
0:02:11.968,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria

43
0:02:14.612,000 --> 0:02:15,000
under President Abacha,

44
0:02:16.586,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.

45
0:02:20.088,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We've spent a great deal of time

46
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
investigating a $1 billion --

47
0:02:24.731,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that's right, a $1 billion —

48
0:02:26.494,000 --> 0:02:28,000
oil deal that he was involved with,

49
0:02:29.155,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and what we found was pretty shocking,

50
0:02:31.107,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but more about that later.

51
0:02:33.873,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So it's easy to think that corruption happens

52
0:02:37.39,000 --> 0:02:38,000
somewhere over there,

53
0:02:39.25,000 --> 0:02:41,000
carried out by a bunch of greedy despots

54
0:02:41.706,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and individuals up to no good in countries

55
0:02:43.73,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that we, personally, may know very little about

56
0:02:46.738,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and feel really unconnected to

57
0:02:48.427,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and unaffected by what might be going on.

58
0:02:51.915,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But does it just happen over there?

59
0:02:55.158,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.

60
0:02:58.437,000 --> 0:03:,000
My first job out of university

61
0:03:01.218,000 --> 0:03:04,000
was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.

62
0:03:05.202,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that's how my relationship with corruption really began.

63
0:03:09.431,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In 1993, with two friends who were colleagues,

64
0:03:12.439,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,

65
0:03:15.242,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we set up an organization called Global Witness.

66
0:03:18.843,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Our first campaign was investigating the role

67
0:03:21.593,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.

68
0:03:25.899,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So a few years later, and it's now 1997,

69
0:03:28.942,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.

70
0:03:33.703,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Perhaps you saw the film,

71
0:03:35.43,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"

72
0:03:37.121,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.

73
0:03:38.698,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, some of that sprang from our work.

74
0:03:42.153,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims

75
0:03:44.869,000 --> 0:03:46,000
who were struggling to survive on the streets

76
0:03:47.049,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and war orphans living in sewers under the streets,

77
0:03:50.137,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and a tiny, very wealthy elite

78
0:03:52.226,000 --> 0:03:55,000
who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.

79
0:03:55.445,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And it was a slightly crazy place.

80
0:03:58.206,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room

81
0:04:01.89,000 --> 0:04:04,000
feeling just totally overwhelmed.

82
0:04:04.95,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.

83
0:04:07.306,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there

84
0:04:10.208,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who, well, they talked about a different problem:

85
0:04:12.576,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale

86
0:04:15.997,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and millions of oil dollars going missing.

87
0:04:19.331,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And for what was then a very small organization

88
0:04:21.792,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of just a few people,

89
0:04:23.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that

90
0:04:26.682,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was an enormous challenge.

91
0:04:29.153,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And in the years that I've been,

92
0:04:30.701,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and we've all been campaigning and investigating,

93
0:04:33.255,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption

94
0:04:35.519,000 --> 0:04:37,000
on a global, massive scale possible,

95
0:04:37.787,000 --> 0:04:4,000
well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power

96
0:04:40.921,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."

97
0:04:43.36,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I mean, yes, it's all of those,

98
0:04:45.397,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but corruption, it's made possible by the actions

99
0:04:48.349,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of global facilitators.

100
0:04:51.97,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.

101
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, they're all people we've investigated,

102
0:04:56.677,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone.

103
0:04:59.463,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up

104
0:05:01.903,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with high-end art and luxury houses without help.

105
0:05:05.742,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He did business with global banks.

106
0:05:07.917,000 --> 0:05:1,000
A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him,

107
0:05:11.756,000 --> 0:05:13,000
one of which was used to buy the art,

108
0:05:14.154,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and American banks, well, they funneled

109
0:05:16.795,000 --> 0:05:18,000
73 million dollars into the States,

110
0:05:19.731,000 --> 0:05:23,000
some of which was used to buy that California mansion.

111
0:05:23.83,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And he didn't do all of this in his own name either.

112
0:05:26.738,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He used shell companies.

113
0:05:28.492,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He used one to buy the property, and another,

114
0:05:30.826,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which was in somebody else's name,

115
0:05:32.912,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.

116
0:05:36.91,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And then there's Dan Etete.

117
0:05:39.138,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Well, when he was oil minister,

118
0:05:41.22,000 --> 0:05:46,000
he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars

119
0:05:46.35,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to a company that, guess what, yeah,

120
0:05:49.184,000 --> 0:05:51,000
he was the hidden owner of.

121
0:05:51.567,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now, it was then much later traded on

122
0:05:54.969,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government --

123
0:05:57.565,000 --> 0:05:59,000
now I have to be careful what I say here —

124
0:05:59.647,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni,

125
0:06:03.796,000 --> 0:06:05,000
two of the biggest oil companies around.

126
0:06:06.45,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption,

127
0:06:08.903,000 --> 0:06:1,000
well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries

128
0:06:11.346,000 --> 0:06:14,000
like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.

129
0:06:14.545,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This engine, well, it's driven

130
0:06:16.869,000 --> 0:06:18,000
by our international banking system,

131
0:06:19.235,000 --> 0:06:21,000
by the problem of anonymous shell companies,

132
0:06:21.778,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and by the secrecy that we have afforded

133
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
big oil, gas and mining operations,

134
0:06:27.129,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and, most of all, by the failure of our politicians

135
0:06:30.862,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to back up their rhetoric and do something

136
0:06:32.937,000 --> 0:06:36,000
really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff.

137
0:06:37.929,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now let's take the banks first.

138
0:06:39.94,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, it's not going to come as any surprise

139
0:06:42.274,000 --> 0:06:46,000
for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money,

140
0:06:46.586,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too.

141
0:06:51.13,000 --> 0:06:54,000
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.

142
0:06:54.237,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now this region, it has just five percent

143
0:06:57.876,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of its forests left intact. Five percent.

144
0:07:03.292,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So how did that happen?

145
0:07:04.627,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Well, because an elite and its facilitators

146
0:07:07.683,000 --> 0:07:09,000
have been making millions of dollars

147
0:07:09.857,000 --> 0:07:12,000
from supporting logging on an industrial scale

148
0:07:13.388,000 --> 0:07:15,000
for many years.

149
0:07:15.794,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we sent an undercover investigator in

150
0:07:18.048,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite,

151
0:07:21.638,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry,

152
0:07:24.969,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and you can see that on YouTube,

153
0:07:27.219,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but it proved what we had long suspected,

154
0:07:29.196,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because it showed how the state's chief minister,

155
0:07:32.693,000 --> 0:07:33,000
despite his later denials,

156
0:07:34.603,000 --> 0:07:37,000
used his control over land and forest licenses

157
0:07:38.002,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to enrich himself and his family.

158
0:07:41.033,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled

159
0:07:45.632,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the region's largest logging companies

160
0:07:47.641,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that were responsible for some of that destruction

161
0:07:50.046,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in Sarawak and elsewhere.

162
0:07:52.633,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process,

163
0:07:56.341,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but it earned around 130 million dollars.

164
0:08:00.161,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now shortly after our exposé,

165
0:08:02.497,000 --> 0:08:04,000
very shortly after our exposé earlier this year,

166
0:08:05.099,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the bank announced a policy review on this.

167
0:08:08.103,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And is this progress? Maybe,

168
0:08:10.689,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but we're going to be keeping a very close eye

169
0:08:13.192,000 --> 0:08:15,000
on that case.

170
0:08:15.529,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.

171
0:08:18.942,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think,

172
0:08:21.771,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and we all know they're used quite a bit

173
0:08:24.267,000 --> 0:08:26,000
by people and companies who are trying to avoid

174
0:08:26.853,000 --> 0:08:29,000
paying their proper dues to society,

175
0:08:29.9,000 --> 0:08:31,000
also known as taxes.

176
0:08:31.953,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But what doesn't usually come to light

177
0:08:34.862,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is how shell companies are used to steal

178
0:08:39.412,000 --> 0:08:42,000
huge sums of money, transformational sums of money,

179
0:08:42.784,000 --> 0:08:44,000
from poor countries.

180
0:08:44.83,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated,

181
0:08:48.25,000 --> 0:08:5,000
shell companies have appeared,

182
0:08:50.462,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and sometimes it's been impossible to find out

183
0:08:52.822,000 --> 0:08:55,000
who is really involved in the deal.

184
0:08:56.334,000 --> 0:08:58,000
A recent study by the World Bank

185
0:08:58.662,000 --> 0:09:,000
looked at 200 cases of corruption.

186
0:09:01.612,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It found that over 70 percent of those cases

187
0:09:04.702,000 --> 0:09:06,000
had used anonymous shell companies,

188
0:09:07.656,000 --> 0:09:1,000
totaling almost 56 billion dollars.

189
0:09:11.038,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now many of these companies were in America

190
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or the United Kingdom,

191
0:09:14.61,000 --> 0:09:16,000
its overseas territories and Crown dependencies,

192
0:09:17.011,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and so it's not just an offshore problem,

193
0:09:19.265,000 --> 0:09:21,000
it's an on-shore one too.

194
0:09:21.557,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You see, shell companies, they're central

195
0:09:23.696,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites

196
0:09:26.95,000 --> 0:09:29,000
rather than ordinary citizens.

197
0:09:29.974,000 --> 0:09:32,000
One striking recent case that we've investigated

198
0:09:33.22,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo

199
0:09:36.196,000 --> 0:09:4,000
sold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets

200
0:09:40.553,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands.

201
0:09:43.907,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So we spoke to sources in country,

202
0:09:46.179,000 --> 0:09:49,000
trawled through company documents and other information

203
0:09:49.215,000 --> 0:09:53,000
trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.

204
0:09:53.27,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies

205
0:09:56.095,000 --> 0:09:58,000
had quickly flipped many of the assets on

206
0:09:58.611,000 --> 0:10:02,000
for huge profits to major international mining companies

207
0:10:02.832,000 --> 0:10:04,000
listed in London.

208
0:10:05.195,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan,

209
0:10:08.451,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they've calculated that Congo may have lost

210
0:10:11.339,000 --> 0:10:16,000
more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.

211
0:10:16.443,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That's almost twice

212
0:10:18.696,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the country's annual health and education budget combined.

213
0:10:24.336,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?

214
0:10:26.962,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Well, the answer to that question,

215
0:10:28.62,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and who was really involved and what really happened,

216
0:10:30.514,000 --> 0:10:32,000
well that's going to probably remain locked away

217
0:10:33.017,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands

218
0:10:36.166,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and elsewhere unless we all do something about it.

219
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And how about the oil, gas and mining companies?

220
0:10:43.987,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Okay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them.

221
0:10:46.701,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.

222
0:10:48.821,000 --> 0:10:52,000
There's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?

223
0:10:53.254,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Well, because there's a lot at stake.

224
0:10:55.454,000 --> 0:10:59,000
In 2011, natural resource exports

225
0:10:59.551,000 --> 0:11:02,000
outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one

226
0:11:03.063,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one.

227
0:11:07.486,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities

228
0:11:11.123,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and hospitals and business startups,

229
0:11:13.1,000 --> 0:11:15,000
many of which haven't materialized and never will

230
0:11:15.458,000 --> 0:11:19,000
because some of that money has simply been stolen away.

231
0:11:19.789,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies,

232
0:11:22.194,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal.

233
0:11:25.21,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit

234
0:11:28.499,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because it's a very live issue, and our lawyers

235
0:11:30.796,000 --> 0:11:32,000
have been through this in some detail

236
0:11:32.986,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and they want me to get it right.

237
0:11:36.296,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward.

238
0:11:40.469,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni

239
0:11:42.569,000 --> 0:11:44,000
paid the Nigerian government for the block.

240
0:11:45.543,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The Nigerian government transferred

241
0:11:47.706,000 --> 0:11:49,000
precisely the same amount, to the very dollar,

242
0:11:50.53,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to an account earmarked for a shell company

243
0:11:55.145,000 --> 0:11:57,000
whose hidden owner was Etete.

244
0:11:57.271,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.

245
0:12:00.66,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And here's the thing.

246
0:12:02.117,000 --> 0:12:03,000
After many months of digging around

247
0:12:03.994,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents,

248
0:12:07.529,000 --> 0:12:08,000
we found evidence that, in fact,

249
0:12:09.484,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Shell and Eni had known that the funds

250
0:12:12.913,000 --> 0:12:15,000
would be transferred to that shell company,

251
0:12:15.988,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and frankly, it's hard to believe they didn't know

252
0:12:19.695,000 --> 0:12:22,000
who they were really dealing with there.

253
0:12:22.986,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts

254
0:12:26.074,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to find out where the money in deals like this went.

255
0:12:28.603,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I mean, these are state assets.

256
0:12:30.172,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They're supposed to be used for the benefit

257
0:12:31.638,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of the people in the country.

258
0:12:33.371,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But in some countries, citizens and journalists

259
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
who are trying to expose stories like this

260
0:12:38.584,000 --> 0:12:39,000
have been harassed and arrested

261
0:12:40.085,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and some have even risked their lives to do so.

262
0:12:44.54,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And finally, well, there are those who believe

263
0:12:48.344,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that corruption is unavoidable.

264
0:12:50.668,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It's just how some business is done.

265
0:12:52.817,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's too complex and difficult to change.

266
0:12:55.382,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So in effect, what? We just accept it.

267
0:12:58.309,000 --> 0:13:,000
But as a campaigner and investigator,

268
0:13:00.702,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I have a different view,

269
0:13:01.753,000 --> 0:13:03,000
because I've seen what can happen

270
0:13:03.923,000 --> 0:13:05,000
when an idea gains momentum.

271
0:13:06.477,000 --> 0:13:08,000
In the oil and mining sector, for example,

272
0:13:09.221,000 --> 0:13:1,000
there is now the beginning

273
0:13:10.484,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of a truly worldwide transparency standard

274
0:13:13.733,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that could tackle some of these problems.

275
0:13:16.753,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In 1999, when Global Witness called

276
0:13:19.175,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent,

277
0:13:22.514,000 --> 0:13:25,000
well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté

278
0:13:26.303,000 --> 0:13:28,000
of that small idea.

279
0:13:28.406,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But literally hundreds of civil society groups

280
0:13:31.976,000 --> 0:13:32,000
from around the world came together

281
0:13:33.854,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to fight for transparency,

282
0:13:35.463,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.

283
0:13:39.444,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Two thirds of the value

284
0:13:41.416,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of the world's oil and mining companies

285
0:13:43.736,000 --> 0:13:46,000
are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds.

286
0:13:47.507,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So this is change happening.

287
0:13:48.98,000 --> 0:13:49,000
This is progress.

288
0:13:50.87,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But we're not there yet, by far.

289
0:13:53.993,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Because it really isn't about corruption

290
0:13:56.239,000 --> 0:13:58,000
somewhere over there, is it?

291
0:13:58.354,000 --> 0:14:,000
In a globalized world, corruption

292
0:14:00.559,000 --> 0:14:02,000
is a truly globalized business,

293
0:14:02.822,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and one that needs global solutions,

294
0:14:04.937,000 --> 0:14:07,000
supported and pushed by us all, as global citizens,

295
0:14:08.937,000 --> 0:14:09,000
right here.

296
0:14:10.099,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you.

297
0:14:11.289,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

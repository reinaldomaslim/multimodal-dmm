1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
tell a very well known interviewer on television,

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I just wish it were more organized."

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So ...

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If I controlled the Internet,

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
you could auction your broken heart on eBay.

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Take the money; go to Amazon;

10
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
If I were in charge of the Internet,

14
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,

16
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
U-turn on silent treatment,

17
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.

18
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.

19
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,

20
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but I still stretch miles in all directions.

21
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com

22
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
would be one big website.

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That way you could listen to cool music

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
while you pretend to look for a job

25
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and you're really just chattin' with your pals.

26
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.

28
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They would not email you back

30
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter) --

31
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but you'd get an automated reply.

32
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Their name in your inbox

34
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter) --

35
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it's all you wanted anyway.

36
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.

37
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.

39
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."

40
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:1,000
If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop

41
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,

42
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.

43
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."

44
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now follow me, OK?

45
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.

47
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
One, two, three.

48
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.

49
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That is my grandfather.

50
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.

51
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
He forms an attachment to

52
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,

53
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,

54
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
who grows up to be me --

55
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the guy who usually goes too far.

56
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So if I were emperor of the Internet,

57
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?

58
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But at that point, I would probably

59
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:58,000
already have the lowest possible mortgage

60
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
and the most enlarged possible penis

61
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter) --

62
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.

63
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I wouldn't need it.

64
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,

65
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that --

66
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
pop! -- I'd go wireless.

67
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.

69
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus

70
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized

71
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,

72
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you want to bet just how whack and un-PC

73
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking

74
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?

75
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I guess it's just like life.

76
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It is not a question of if you can --

77
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's: do ya?

78
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We can interfere with the interface.

79
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace

80
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
every lucky time we log on.

81
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You don't say a prayer.

82
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You don't write a psalm.

83
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You don't chant an "om."

84
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of

85
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:05,000
at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.

86
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Thank you, TED.

87
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Applause)

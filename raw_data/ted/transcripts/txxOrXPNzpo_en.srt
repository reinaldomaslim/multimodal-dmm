2
0:00:15.83,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Photography has been my passion

3
0:00:17.316,000 --> 0:00:19,000
ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,

4
0:00:20.094,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but today I want to share with you

5
0:00:22.454,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the 15 most treasured photos of mine,

6
0:00:25.736,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I didn't take any of them.

7
0:00:27.331,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There were no art directors, no stylists,

8
0:00:30.222,000 --> 0:00:34,000
no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.

9
0:00:34.658,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.

10
0:00:38.934,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My story begins

11
0:00:40.446,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,

12
0:00:42.964,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter

13
0:00:45.727,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.

14
0:00:50.163,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,

15
0:00:53.704,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so we decided to take the same picture.

16
0:00:57.103,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Well you can see where this is going.

17
0:00:59.352,000 --> 0:01:,000
Approaching my daughter's third birthday,

18
0:01:01.086,000 --> 0:01:03,000
my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York

19
0:01:03.528,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"

20
0:01:07.659,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.

21
0:01:10.686,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You know, it's remarkable how universal

22
0:01:14.003,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.

23
0:01:17.119,000 --> 0:01:21,000
No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.

24
0:01:22.021,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.

25
0:01:25.685,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's really become sacred to us.

26
0:01:27.686,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,

27
0:01:30.317,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day

28
0:01:34.532,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in ways a five-year-old could understand.

29
0:01:37.292,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So these photos are far more than proxies

30
0:01:39.899,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for a single moment, or even a specific trip.

31
0:01:43.04,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They're also ways for us to freeze time

32
0:01:46.203,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for one week in October

33
0:01:50.119,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and reflect on our times

34
0:01:52.467,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and how we change from year to year,

35
0:01:54.619,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and not just physically, but in every way.

36
0:01:57.74,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Because while we take the same photo,

37
0:02:00.107,000 --> 0:02:02,000
our perspectives change,

38
0:02:02.315,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and she reaches new milestones,

39
0:02:05.668,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I get to see life through her eyes,

40
0:02:08.147,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and how she interacts with and sees everything.

41
0:02:12.872,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This very focused time we get to spend together

42
0:02:15.635,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.

43
0:02:21.122,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Recently, on one trip, we were walking,

44
0:02:24.183,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and she stops dead in her tracks,

45
0:02:26.355,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and she points to a red awning of the doll store

46
0:02:29.826,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that she loved when she was little

47
0:02:32.25,000 --> 0:02:34,000
on our earlier trips.

48
0:02:34.522,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And she describes to me the feeling she felt

49
0:02:37.154,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.

50
0:02:40.538,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest

51
0:02:43.567,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when she saw that place for the very first time

52
0:02:46.228,000 --> 0:02:48,000
nine years earlier.

53
0:02:48.9,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And now what she's looking at in New York

54
0:02:51.028,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are colleges,

55
0:02:52.952,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because she's determined to go to school in New York.

56
0:02:56.252,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And it hit me: One of the most important things

57
0:02:59.133,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we all make are memories.

58
0:03:03.142,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role

59
0:03:06.366,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in consciously creating memories.

60
0:03:10.299,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,

61
0:03:13.078,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm not in many of the family photos.

62
0:03:14.732,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'm always the one taking the picture.

63
0:03:17.231,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I want to encourage everyone today

64
0:03:19.686,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to get in the shot,

65
0:03:21.785,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,

66
0:03:24.564,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"Will you take our picture?"

67
0:03:26.606,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Thank you. (Applause)

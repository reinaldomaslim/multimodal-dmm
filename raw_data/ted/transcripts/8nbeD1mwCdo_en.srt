1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When was I was 21 years old,

2
0:00:15.04,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I had all this physics homework.

3
0:00:17.8,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Physics homework requires taking breaks,

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and Wikipedia was relatively new, so I took a lot of breaks there.

5
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I kept going back to the same articles,

6
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:27,000
reading them again and again,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.

8
0:00:33.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
How cool would it be to visit these places

9
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and what would it take to do so?

10
0:00:38.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Well, here we are

11
0:00:39.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane

12
0:00:41.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
operated by NASA

13
0:00:43.64,000 --> 0:00:44,000
flying over the Greenland ice sheet.

14
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's a lot to see here,

15
0:00:48.04,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but there's more that is hidden,

16
0:00:49.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
waiting to be uncovered.

17
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me

18
0:00:54.68,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is that there's liquid water hidden inside the ice sheet,

19
0:00:58.68,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because we didn't know that yet.

20
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I did learn on Wikipedia that the Greenland ice sheet is huge,

21
0:01:05.6,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the size of Mexico,

22
0:01:06.92,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and its ice from top to bottom is two miles thick.

23
0:01:10.72,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it's not just static.

24
0:01:12.6,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The ice flows like a river downhill towards the ocean.

25
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
As it flows around bends,

26
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it deforms and cracks.

27
0:01:21.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,

28
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which are located in one of the most remote physical environments

29
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
remaining on earth.

30
0:01:29.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
To work in glaciology right now is like getting in on the ground floor

31
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at Facebook in the 2000s.

32
0:01:35.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:37.12,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Our capability to fly airplanes and satellites over the ice sheets

34
0:01:40.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is revolutionizing glaciology.

35
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's just starting to do for science

36
0:01:44.48,000 --> 0:01:46,000
what the smartphone has done for social media.

37
0:01:47.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The satellites are reporting a wealth of observations

38
0:01:50.32,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that are revealing new hidden facts about the ice sheets continuously.

39
0:01:55.4,000 --> 0:01:58,000
For instance, we have observations of the size of the Greenland ice sheet

40
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
every month going back to 2002.

41
0:02:02.32,000 --> 0:02:04,000
You can look towards the bottom of the screen here

42
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to see the month and the year go forward.

43
0:02:06.72,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You can see that some areas of the ice sheet melt

44
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or lose ice in the summer.

45
0:02:11.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Other areas experience snowfall

46
0:02:13.72,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or gain ice back in the winter.

47
0:02:16.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed by an overall rate of mass loss

48
0:02:21.72,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that would have stunned a glaciologist 50 years ago.

49
0:02:25.04,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We never thought that an ice sheet could lose mass into the ocean this quickly.

50
0:02:31.32,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Since these measurements began in 2002,

51
0:02:33.92,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the ice sheet has lost so much ice

52
0:02:36.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that if that water were piled up on our smallest continent,

53
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it would drown Australia knee-deep.

54
0:02:42.84,000 --> 0:02:43,000
How is this possible?

55
0:02:45.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.

56
0:02:48.64,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We used radar to image the hills, valleys, mountains and depressions

57
0:02:53.12,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that the ice flows over.

58
0:02:54.96,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels the size of the Grand Canyon

59
0:02:58.48,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that funnel ice and water off of Greenland and into the ocean.

60
0:03:04.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The reason that radar can reveal the bedrock

61
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that ice is entirely transparent to radar.

62
0:03:09.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
You can do an experiment.

63
0:03:11.32,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Go home and put an ice cube in the microwave.

64
0:03:14.92,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It won't melt,

65
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because microwaves, or radar,

66
0:03:18.84,000 --> 0:03:2,000
pass straight through the ice without interacting.

67
0:03:22.76,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If you want to melt your ice cube, you have to get it wet,

68
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because water heats up easily in the microwave.

69
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That's the whole principle the microwave oven is designed around.

70
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Radar can see water.

71
0:03:35.12,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And radar has revealed a vast pool of liquid water

72
0:03:38.84,000 --> 0:03:39,000
hidden under my colleague Olivia,

73
0:03:40.8,000 --> 0:03:41,000
seven stories beneath her feet.

74
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Here, she's used a pump

75
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to bring some of that water back to the ice sheet's surface.

76
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Just six years ago, we had no idea this glacier aquifer existed.

77
0:03:53.84,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The aquifer formed

78
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
when snow melts in the summer sun

79
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and trickles downward.

80
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It puddles up in huge pools.

81
0:04:02.6,000 --> 0:04:04,000
From there, the snow acts as an igloo,

82
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
insulating this water from the cold and the wind above.

83
0:04:09.12,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So the water can stay hidden in the ice sheet

84
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in liquid form year after year.

85
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The question is, what happens next?

86
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Does the water stay there forever?

87
0:04:19.48,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It could.

88
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or does it find a way out to reach the global ocean?

89
0:04:24.4,000 --> 0:04:27,000
One possible way for the water to reach the bedrock

90
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and from there the ocean

91
0:04:29.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.

92
0:04:32.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
When cracks fill with water,

93
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the weight of the water forces them deeper and deeper.

94
0:04:37.6,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is how fracking works

95
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to extract natural gas from deep within the earth.

96
0:04:42.08,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.

97
0:04:44.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
All it takes is a crack to get started.

98
0:04:47.92,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Well, we recently discovered

99
0:04:50.2,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that there are cracks available in the Greenland ice sheet

100
0:04:54.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
near this glacier aquifer.

101
0:04:56.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You can fly over most of the Greenland ice sheet

102
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and see nothing,

103
0:04:59.96,000 --> 0:05:01,000
no cracks, no features on the surface,

104
0:05:02.88,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but as this helicopter flies towards the coast,

105
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the path that water would take on its quest to flow downhill,

106
0:05:09.72,000 --> 0:05:1,000
one crack appears,

107
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
then another and another.

108
0:05:14.84,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Are these cracks filled with liquid water?

109
0:05:17.44,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And if so, how deep do they take that water?

110
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Can they take it to the bedrock

111
0:05:21.64,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and the ocean?

112
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:24,000
To answer these questions,

113
0:05:24.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we need something beyond remote sensing data.

114
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We need numeric models.

115
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I write numeric models that run on supercomputers.

116
0:05:34.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
A numeric model is simply a set of equations

117
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that works together to describe something.

118
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It can be as simple as the next number in a sequence --

119
0:05:42.52,000 --> 0:05:44,000
one, three, five, seven --

120
0:05:45.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or it can be a more complex set of equations

121
0:05:47.72,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that predict the future

122
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
based on known conditions in the present.

123
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In our case, what are the equations for how ice cracks?

124
0:05:56.24,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, engineers already have a very good understanding

125
0:05:59.84,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of how aluminum, steel and plastics fracture under stress.

126
0:06:04.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's an important problem in our society.

127
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And it turns out that the engineering equations

128
0:06:10.04,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for how materials fracture

129
0:06:11.64,000 --> 0:06:13,000
are not that different from my physics homework.

130
0:06:14.4,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,

131
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and then I had a numeric model for how a crevasse can fracture

132
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when filled with water from the aquifer.

133
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is the power of math.

134
0:06:25.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It can help us understand real processes in our world.

135
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'll show you now the results of my numeric model,

136
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but first I should point out

137
0:06:34.2,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that the crevasse is about a thousand times narrower than it is deep,

138
0:06:38.04,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so in the main panel here,

139
0:06:39.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we've zoomed in to better see the details.

140
0:06:41.68,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You can look to the smaller panel on the right

141
0:06:43.88,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to see the true scale for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.

142
0:06:48.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
As the aquifer water flows into the crevasse,

143
0:06:51.04,000 --> 0:06:54,000
some of it refreezes in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.

144
0:06:55.04,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's about as cold as your kitchen freezer.

145
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But this loss can be overcome

146
0:06:59.56,000 --> 0:07:02,000
if the flow rate in from the glacier aquifer is high enough.

147
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In our case, it is,

148
0:07:05.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and the aquifer water drives the crevasse all the way to the base of the ice sheet

149
0:07:09.68,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a thousand meters below.

150
0:07:12.8,000 --> 0:07:14,000
From there, it has a clear path to reach the ocean.

151
0:07:16.48,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So the aquifer water is a part

152
0:07:18.84,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of the three millimeters per year of sea level rise

153
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we experience as a global society.

154
0:07:26.52,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But there's more:

155
0:07:27.8,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the aquifer water might be punching above its weight.

156
0:07:31.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The ice flows in complex ways.

157
0:07:35.04,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In some places, the ice flows very fast.

158
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There tends to be water at the base of the ice sheet here.

159
0:07:41.4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In other places, not so fast.

160
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Usually, there's not water present at the base there.

161
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now that we know the aquifer water is getting to the base of the ice sheet,

162
0:07:50.4,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the next question is:

163
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Is it making the ice itself flow faster into the ocean?

164
0:07:58.08,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We're trying to uncover these mysteries hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet

165
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so that we can better plan for the sea level rise it holds.

166
0:08:06.12,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The amount of ice that Greenland has lost since 2002

167
0:08:09.48,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is just a small fraction of what that ice sheet holds.

168
0:08:14.12,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines that operate on long timescales.

169
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In the next 80 years, global sea levels will rise at least 20 centimeters,

170
0:08:24.6,000 --> 0:08:26,000
perhaps as much as one meter,

171
0:08:26.8,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and maybe more.

172
0:08:28.6,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Our understanding of future sea level rise is good,

173
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but our projections have a wide range.

174
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's our role as glaciologists and scientists

175
0:08:37.36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to narrow these uncertainties.

176
0:08:40.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
How much sea level rise is coming,

177
0:08:43.04,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and how fast will it get here?

178
0:08:46.4,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We need to know how much and how fast,

179
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so the world and its communities can plan for the sea level rise that's coming.

180
0:08:55.039,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Thank you.

181
0:08:56.509,000 --> 0:08:59,000

1
0:00:12.394,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"Give me liberty or give me death."

2
0:00:15.999,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,

3
0:00:18.266,000 --> 0:00:2,000
said these words in 1775,

4
0:00:21.191,000 --> 0:00:22,000
he could never have imagined

5
0:00:23.094,000 --> 0:00:25,000
just how much they would come to resonate

6
0:00:25.159,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with American generations to come.

7
0:00:28.182,000 --> 0:00:3,000
At the time, these words were earmarked

8
0:00:30.847,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and targeted against the British,

9
0:00:33.22,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody

10
0:00:36.119,000 --> 0:00:38,000
what many Westerners believe,

11
0:00:38.807,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that freedom is the most cherished value,

12
0:00:42.255,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and that the best systems of politics and economics

13
0:00:45.176,000 --> 0:00:47,000
have freedom embedded in them.

14
0:00:47.39,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Who could blame them?

15
0:00:49.184,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Over the past hundred years, the combination

16
0:00:52.098,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of liberal democracy and private capitalism

17
0:00:55.141,000 --> 0:00:57,000
has helped to catapult the United States

18
0:00:57.561,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and Western countries

19
0:00:58.822,000 --> 0:01:,000
to new levels of economic development.

20
0:01:01.235,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In the United States over the past hundred years,

21
0:01:03.953,000 --> 0:01:05,000
incomes have increased 30 times,

22
0:01:06.343,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and hundreds of thousands of people

23
0:01:08.014,000 --> 0:01:1,000
have been moved out of poverty.

24
0:01:10.287,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation

25
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:17,000
has helped to spur industrialization

26
0:01:17.699,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and also helped in the creation and the building

27
0:01:20.561,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of things like household appliances

28
0:01:22.352,000 --> 0:01:24,000
such as refrigerators and televisions,

29
0:01:24.575,000 --> 0:01:28,000
motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.

30
0:01:28.623,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths

31
0:01:31.305,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of the private capitalism crisis,

32
0:01:33.569,000 --> 0:01:34,000
President Obama said,

33
0:01:35.336,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"The question before us is not whether the market

34
0:01:38.232,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is a force for good or ill.

35
0:01:40.867,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom

36
0:01:44.09,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is unmatched."

37
0:01:46.168,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Thus, there's understandably

38
0:01:48.057,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a deep-seated presumption among Westerners

39
0:01:51.191,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that the whole world will decide to adopt

40
0:01:54.001,000 --> 0:01:57,000
private capitalism as the model of economic growth,

41
0:01:57.085,000 --> 0:01:59,000
liberal democracy, and will continue

42
0:01:59.392,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to prioritize political rights over economic rights.

43
0:02:03.523,000 --> 0:02:05,000
However, to many who live in the emerging markets,

44
0:02:06.373,000 --> 0:02:08,000
this is an illusion, and even though

45
0:02:09.337,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

46
0:02:11.444,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which was signed in 1948,

47
0:02:13.715,000 --> 0:02:15,000
was unanimously adopted,

48
0:02:16.01,000 --> 0:02:18,000
what it did was to mask a schism

49
0:02:18.701,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that has emerged between developed and developing countries,

50
0:02:22.224,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the ideological beliefs

51
0:02:24.305,000 --> 0:02:27,000
between political and economic rights.

52
0:02:27.952,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This schism has only grown wider.

53
0:02:31.489,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,

54
0:02:34.059,000 --> 0:02:36,000
where 90 percent of the world's population lives,

55
0:02:36.972,000 --> 0:02:38,000
believe that the Western obsession

56
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with political rights is beside the point,

57
0:02:41.627,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and what is actually important

58
0:02:43.605,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is delivering on food, shelter,

59
0:02:45.826,000 --> 0:02:47,000
education and healthcare.

60
0:02:47.924,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Give me liberty or give me death"

61
0:02:50.34,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is all well and good if you can afford it,

62
0:02:53.103,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,

63
0:02:56.066,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you're far too busy trying to survive

64
0:02:58.034,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and to provide for your family

65
0:02:59.85,000 --> 0:03:,000
than to spend your time going around

66
0:03:01.381,000 --> 0:03:04,000
trying to proclaim and defend democracy.

67
0:03:04.392,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, I know many people in this room

68
0:03:06.239,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and around the world will think,

69
0:03:08.427,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"

70
0:03:11.41,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because private capitalism and liberal democracy

71
0:03:14.637,000 --> 0:03:16,000
are held sacrosanct.

72
0:03:16.903,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But I ask you today, what would you do

73
0:03:19.272,000 --> 0:03:2,000
if you had to choose?

74
0:03:21.083,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What if you had to choose

75
0:03:22.897,000 --> 0:03:24,000
between a roof over your head

76
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the right to vote?

77
0:03:27.037,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Over the last 10 years,

78
0:03:28.63,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,

79
0:03:32.41,000 --> 0:03:34,000
many of them in the emerging markets,

80
0:03:34.615,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in Latin America, Asia,

81
0:03:36.943,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and my own continent of Africa.

82
0:03:39.625,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I've met with presidents, dissidents,

83
0:03:42.265,000 --> 0:03:44,000
policymakers, lawyers, teachers,

84
0:03:44.633,000 --> 0:03:46,000
doctors and the man on the street,

85
0:03:46.936,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and through these conversations,

86
0:03:48.619,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it's become clear to me

87
0:03:50.419,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that many people in the emerging markets

88
0:03:52.347,000 --> 0:03:55,000
believe that there's actually a split occurring

89
0:03:55.556,000 --> 0:03:57,000
between what people believe ideologically

90
0:03:58.322,000 --> 0:04:,000
in terms of politics and economics in the West

91
0:04:01.008,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and that which people believe in the rest of the world.

92
0:04:03.892,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, don't get me wrong.

93
0:04:05.763,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm not saying people in the emerging markets

94
0:04:07.223,000 --> 0:04:09,000
don't understand democracy,

95
0:04:09.314,000 --> 0:04:1,000
nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally

96
0:04:11.223,000 --> 0:04:13,000
like to pick their presidents or their leaders.

97
0:04:13.708,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Of course they would.

98
0:04:15.263,000 --> 0:04:18,000
However, I am saying that on balance,

99
0:04:18.284,000 --> 0:04:19,000
they worry more about

100
0:04:19.866,000 --> 0:04:22,000
where their living standard improvements are going to come from,

101
0:04:22.897,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and how it is their governments can deliver for them,

102
0:04:25.18,000 --> 0:04:26,000
than whether or not the government

103
0:04:27.085,000 --> 0:04:29,000
was elected by democracy.

104
0:04:30.025,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The fact of the matter

105
0:04:32.114,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is that this has become a very poignant question

106
0:04:34.579,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because there is for the first time in a long time

107
0:04:36.912,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a real challenge to the Western ideological systems

108
0:04:40.482,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of politics and economics,

109
0:04:42.636,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and this is a system that is embodied by China.

110
0:04:45.709,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism.

111
0:04:49.687,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system.

112
0:04:53.959,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And they have also decided to prioritize

113
0:04:56.323,000 --> 0:04:59,000
economic rights over political rights.

114
0:04:59.98,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I put it to you today that it is this system

115
0:05:02.829,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that is embodied by China

116
0:05:04.674,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that is gathering momentum amongst people

117
0:05:06.634,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in the emerging markets as the system to follow,

118
0:05:09.722,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because they believe increasingly

119
0:05:11.742,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that it is the system

120
0:05:13.417,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that will promise the best and fastest improvements

121
0:05:16.818,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in living standards in the shortest period of time.

122
0:05:20.429,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments

123
0:05:23.008,000 --> 0:05:24,000
explaining to you first

124
0:05:24.83,000 --> 0:05:28,000
why economically they've come to this belief.

125
0:05:28.86,000 --> 0:05:3,000
First of all, it's China's economic performance

126
0:05:31.686,000 --> 0:05:33,000
over the past 30 years.

127
0:05:33.728,000 --> 0:05:35,000
She's been able to produce record economic growth

128
0:05:36.448,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,

129
0:05:40.083,000 --> 0:05:43,000
specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty

130
0:05:43.262,000 --> 0:05:45,000
by moving over 300 million people

131
0:05:46.076,000 --> 0:05:49,000
out of indigence.

132
0:05:49.334,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's not just in economics,

133
0:05:51.848,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but it's also in terms of living standards.

134
0:05:54.345,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We see that in China, 28 percent of people

135
0:05:57.189,000 --> 0:05:58,000
had secondary school access.

136
0:05:59.012,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Today, it's closer to 82 percent.

137
0:06:01.389,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So in its totality, economic improvement

138
0:06:03.984,000 --> 0:06:05,000
has been quite significant.

139
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Second, China has been able

140
0:06:09.716,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to meaningfully improve its income inequality

141
0:06:12.852,000 --> 0:06:14,000
without changing the political construct.

142
0:06:15.517,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Today, the United States and China

143
0:06:17.947,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are the two leading economies in the world.

144
0:06:20.473,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They have vastly different political systems

145
0:06:22.722,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and different economic systems,

146
0:06:25.044,000 --> 0:06:26,000
one with private capitalism,

147
0:06:26.514,000 --> 0:06:28,000
another one broadly with state capitalism.

148
0:06:28.953,000 --> 0:06:3,000
However, these two countries

149
0:06:31.026,000 --> 0:06:33,000
have the identical GINI Coefficient,

150
0:06:33.133,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which is a measure of income equality.

151
0:06:35.68,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Perhaps what is more disturbing

152
0:06:37.912,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that China's income equality

153
0:06:40.006,000 --> 0:06:42,000
has been improving in recent times,

154
0:06:42.327,000 --> 0:06:43,000
whereas that of the United States

155
0:06:43.944,000 --> 0:06:46,000
has been declining.

156
0:06:47.007,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets

157
0:06:49.563,000 --> 0:06:51,000
look at China's amazing and legendary

158
0:06:51.957,000 --> 0:06:53,000
infrastructure rollout.

159
0:06:54.283,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is not just about China

160
0:06:55.942,000 --> 0:06:57,000
building roads and ports and railways

161
0:06:58.302,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in her own country --

162
0:06:59.738,000 --> 0:07:02,000
she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers

163
0:07:02.826,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of road network in China

164
0:07:04.417,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and surpass that of the United States --

165
0:07:07.365,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but even if you look to places like Africa,

166
0:07:10.176,000 --> 0:07:13,000
China has been able to help tar the distance

167
0:07:13.233,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of Cape Town to Cairo,

168
0:07:14.887,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which is 9,000 miles,

169
0:07:16.512,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or three times the distance of New York to California.

170
0:07:20.423,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now this is something that people can see and point to.

171
0:07:24.863,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Perhaps it's no surprise

172
0:07:26.545,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,

173
0:07:30.266,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Africans in 10 countries said

174
0:07:32.134,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they thought that the Chinese were doing

175
0:07:33.802,000 --> 0:07:34,000
amazing things to improve their livelihoods

176
0:07:35.696,000 --> 0:07:39,000
by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.

177
0:07:40.194,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions

178
0:07:44.714,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to age-old social problems that the world faces.

179
0:07:48.085,000 --> 0:07:51,000
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,

180
0:07:51.353,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics

181
0:07:54.605,000 --> 0:07:56,000
continue to be a stumbling block

182
0:07:56.832,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to the delivery of medicine and healthcare

183
0:07:58.933,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in the rural areas.

184
0:08:00.803,000 --> 0:08:02,000
However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,

185
0:08:03.681,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,

186
0:08:06.577,000 --> 0:08:07,000
using their companies

187
0:08:08.067,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.

188
0:08:11.339,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise

189
0:08:13.545,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying,

190
0:08:16.795,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"I like that. I want that.

191
0:08:18.937,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I want to be able to do what China's doing.

192
0:08:21.131,000 --> 0:08:23,000
That is the system that seems to work."

193
0:08:23.901,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I'm here to also tell you

194
0:08:25.574,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that there are lots of shifts occurring

195
0:08:27.321,000 --> 0:08:28,000
around what China is doing

196
0:08:29.281,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in the democratic stance.

197
0:08:31.356,000 --> 0:08:33,000
In particular, there is growing doubt

198
0:08:34.021,000 --> 0:08:36,000
among people in the emerging markets,

199
0:08:36.123,000 --> 0:08:37,000
when people now believe that democracy

200
0:08:37.83,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is no longer to be viewed

201
0:08:40.114,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as a prerequisite for economic growth.

202
0:08:43.597,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,

203
0:08:47.838,000 --> 0:08:49,000
not just China, have shown that actually,

204
0:08:50.746,000 --> 0:08:52,000
it's economic growth that is a prerequisite

205
0:08:53.432,000 --> 0:08:54,000
for democracy.

206
0:08:55.196,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In a recent study, the evidence has shown

207
0:08:58.442,000 --> 0:09:,000
that income is the greatest determinant

208
0:09:00.94,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of how long a democracy can last.

209
0:09:03.688,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The study found that if your per capita income

210
0:09:06.421,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is about 1,000 dollars a year,

211
0:09:08.633,000 --> 0:09:1,000
your democracy will last about eight and a half years.

212
0:09:11.631,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If your per capita income is between

213
0:09:13.349,000 --> 0:09:15,000
2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,

214
0:09:15.749,000 --> 0:09:18,000
then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.

215
0:09:18.791,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And only if your per capita income

216
0:09:20.615,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is above 6,000 dollars a year

217
0:09:22.746,000 --> 0:09:25,000
will you have democracy come hell or high water.

218
0:09:26.49,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What this is telling us

219
0:09:28.202,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is that we need to first establish a middle class

220
0:09:30.775,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that is able to hold the government accountable.

221
0:09:33.892,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But perhaps it's also telling us

222
0:09:36.267,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we should be worried about going

223
0:09:37.849,000 --> 0:09:39,000
around the world and shoehorning democracy,

224
0:09:40.759,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because ultimately we run the risk

225
0:09:42.569,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of ending up with illiberal democracies,

226
0:09:44.699,000 --> 0:09:46,000
democracies that in some sense

227
0:09:46.76,000 --> 0:09:48,000
could be worse than the authoritarian governments

228
0:09:48.927,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that they seek to replace.

229
0:09:52.614,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The evidence around illiberal democracies

230
0:09:54.88,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is quite depressing.

231
0:09:56.7,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent

232
0:09:59.146,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of the world's countries today are democratic,

233
0:10:02.303,000 --> 0:10:04,000
70 percent of those countries are illiberal

234
0:10:05.009,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in the sense that people don't have free speech

235
0:10:07.362,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or freedom of movement.

236
0:10:10.107,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But also, we're finding from Freedom House

237
0:10:12.426,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in a study that they published last year

238
0:10:14.547,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that freedom has been on the decline

239
0:10:16.662,000 --> 0:10:18,000
every year for the past seven years.

240
0:10:19.234,000 --> 0:10:2,000
What this says

241
0:10:21.018,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is that for people like me

242
0:10:22.356,000 --> 0:10:24,000
who care about liberal democracy,

243
0:10:24.966,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is we've got to find a more sustainable way

244
0:10:27.313,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of ensuring that we have a sustainable form

245
0:10:29.658,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of democracy in a liberal way,

246
0:10:31.859,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and that has its roots in economics.

247
0:10:34.859,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But it also says that as China moves

248
0:10:37.788,000 --> 0:10:39,000
toward being the largest economy in the world,

249
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:42,000
something that is expected to happen

250
0:10:42.341,000 --> 0:10:44,000
by experts in 2016,

251
0:10:44.416,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that this schism between the political

252
0:10:46.686,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and economic ideologies of the West and the rest

253
0:10:50.048,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is likely to widen.

254
0:10:52.979,000 --> 0:10:54,000
What might that world look like?

255
0:10:55.534,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Well, the world could look like

256
0:10:57.096,000 --> 0:11:,000
more state involvement and state capitalism;

257
0:11:00.361,000 --> 0:11:02,000
greater protectionisms of nation-states;

258
0:11:03.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,

259
0:11:05.709,000 --> 0:11:07,000
ever-declining political rights

260
0:11:07.876,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and individual rights.

261
0:11:09.937,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The question that is left for us in general

262
0:11:12.699,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is, what then should the West be doing?

263
0:11:15.815,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And I suggest that they have two options.

264
0:11:18.52,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The West can either compete or cooperate.

265
0:11:22.937,000 --> 0:11:25,000
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,

266
0:11:26.125,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and in effect go around the world

267
0:11:28.132,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and continue to try and push an agenda

268
0:11:30.459,000 --> 0:11:33,000
of private capitalism and liberal democracy,

269
0:11:33.499,000 --> 0:11:35,000
this is basically going against headwinds,

270
0:11:36.155,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but it also would be a natural stance

271
0:11:38.179,000 --> 0:11:39,000
for the West to take

272
0:11:39.64,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because in many ways it is the antithesis

273
0:11:41.673,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of the Chinese model

274
0:11:43.82,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.

275
0:11:47.948,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now the fact of the matter is,

276
0:11:49.727,000 --> 0:11:5,000
if the West decides to compete,

277
0:11:51.685,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it will create a wider schism.

278
0:11:55.083,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The other option is for the West to cooperate,

279
0:11:57.936,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and by cooperating I mean

280
0:11:59.53,000 --> 0:12:02,000
giving the emerging market countries the flexibility

281
0:12:03.04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to figure out in an organic way

282
0:12:05.087,000 --> 0:12:06,000
what political and economic system

283
0:12:06.849,000 --> 0:12:07,000
works best for them.

284
0:12:08.542,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now I'm sure some of you in the room

285
0:12:10.272,000 --> 0:12:12,000
will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,

286
0:12:13.146,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and this is a way, in other words,

287
0:12:15.217,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for the West to take a back seat.

288
0:12:17.129,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But I put it to you

289
0:12:18.584,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that if the United States and European countries

290
0:12:20.934,000 --> 0:12:22,000
want to remain globally influential,

291
0:12:23.585,000 --> 0:12:24,000
they may have to consider cooperating

292
0:12:25.455,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in the short term in order to compete,

293
0:12:28.004,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and by that, they might have to focus

294
0:12:30.247,000 --> 0:12:33,000
more aggressively on economic outcomes

295
0:12:33.482,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to help create the middle class

296
0:12:35.191,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and therefore be able to hold government accountable

297
0:12:37.862,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and create the democracies that we really want.

298
0:12:41.889,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The fact of the matter is that

299
0:12:44.478,000 --> 0:12:45,000
instead of going around the world

300
0:12:46.381,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and haranguing countries for engaging with China,

301
0:12:49.868,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the West should be encouraging its own businesses

302
0:12:52.828,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to trade and invest in these regions.

303
0:12:55.327,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,

304
0:12:59.579,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the West should be showing how it is

305
0:13:02.179,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that their own system of politics and economics

306
0:13:04.566,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is the superior one.

307
0:13:06.716,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And instead of shoehorning democracy

308
0:13:08.736,000 --> 0:13:09,000
around the world,

309
0:13:10.227,000 --> 0:13:11,000
perhaps the West should take a leaf

310
0:13:11.502,000 --> 0:13:12,000
out of its own history book

311
0:13:13.354,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and remember that it takes a lot of patience

312
0:13:16.204,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in order to develop the models

313
0:13:17.774,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and the systems that you have today.

314
0:13:20.107,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer

315
0:13:23.579,000 --> 0:13:25,000
reminds us that it took the United States

316
0:13:26.208,000 --> 0:13:28,000
nearly 170 years

317
0:13:28.854,000 --> 0:13:3,000
from the time that the Constitution was written

318
0:13:31.523,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for there to be equal rights in the United States.

319
0:13:34.483,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Some people would argue that today

320
0:13:35.845,000 --> 0:13:36,000
there is still no equal rights.

321
0:13:37.359,000 --> 0:13:38,000
In fact, there are groups who would argue

322
0:13:39.205,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that they still do not have equal rights under the law.

323
0:13:44.533,000 --> 0:13:45,000
At its very best,

324
0:13:46.115,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the Western model speaks for itself.

325
0:13:48.367,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It's the model that put food on the table.

326
0:13:50.528,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's the refrigerators.

327
0:13:52.119,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It put a man on the moon.

328
0:13:54.151,000 --> 0:13:55,000
But the fact of the matter is,

329
0:13:55.941,000 --> 0:13:56,000
although people back in the day

330
0:13:57.591,000 --> 0:13:59,000
used to point at the Western countries and say,

331
0:13:59.657,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"I want that, I like that,"

332
0:14:01.7,000 --> 0:14:03,000
there's now a new person in town

333
0:14:03.859,000 --> 0:14:05,000
in the form of a country, China.

334
0:14:06.298,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Today, generations are looking at China

335
0:14:08.384,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and saying, "China can produce infrastructure,

336
0:14:11.024,000 --> 0:14:13,000
China can produce economic growth,

337
0:14:13.14,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and we like that."

338
0:14:14.708,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Because ultimately, the question before us,

339
0:14:17.422,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and the question before

340
0:14:19.278,000 --> 0:14:2,000
seven billion people on the planet

341
0:14:20.983,000 --> 0:14:23,000
is, how can we create prosperity?

342
0:14:24.083,000 --> 0:14:26,000
People who care and will pivot towards the model

343
0:14:26.998,000 --> 0:14:27,000
of politics and economics

344
0:14:28.523,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in a very rational way,

345
0:14:30.09,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to those models that will ensure

346
0:14:32.555,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that they can have better living standards

347
0:14:34.536,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in the shortest period of time.

348
0:14:37.159,000 --> 0:14:38,000
As you leave here today,

349
0:14:38.87,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I would like to leave you

350
0:14:40.275,000 --> 0:14:41,000
with a very personal message,

351
0:14:41.928,000 --> 0:14:43,000
which is what it is that I believe

352
0:14:44.014,000 --> 0:14:46,000
we should be doing as individuals,

353
0:14:46.418,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and this is really about being open-minded,

354
0:14:49.787,000 --> 0:14:52,000
open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams

355
0:14:53.126,000 --> 0:14:56,000
of creating prosperity for people around the world,

356
0:14:56.361,000 --> 0:14:58,000
creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty

357
0:14:59.285,000 --> 0:15:,000
for hundreds of millions of people,

358
0:15:00.961,000 --> 0:15:02,000
has to be based in being open-minded,

359
0:15:03.745,000 --> 0:15:05,000
because these systems have good things

360
0:15:05.972,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and they have bad things.

361
0:15:08.449,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Just to illustrate,

362
0:15:10.158,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I went into my annals of myself.

363
0:15:12.644,000 --> 0:15:13,000
That's a picture of me.

364
0:15:14.426,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Awww. (Laughter)

365
0:15:16.666,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.

366
0:15:20.892,000 --> 0:15:21,000
At the time of my birth,

367
0:15:22.839,000 --> 0:15:24,000
blacks were not issued birth certificates,

368
0:15:24.921,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and that law only changed in 1973.

369
0:15:27.265,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.

370
0:15:30.41,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,

371
0:15:32.862,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I've gone from not being recognized as a human being

372
0:15:35.747,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today

373
0:15:38.694,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to talk to you about my views.

374
0:15:41.272,000 --> 0:15:44,000
In this vein, we can increase economic growth.

375
0:15:44.996,000 --> 0:15:47,000
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.

376
0:15:48.413,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But also, it's going to require

377
0:15:50.614,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that we look at our assumptions,

378
0:15:52.608,000 --> 0:15:54,000
assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with

379
0:15:54.835,000 --> 0:15:55,000
around democracy, around private capitalism,

380
0:15:56.814,000 --> 0:15:57,000
around what creates economic growth

381
0:15:58.749,000 --> 0:16:,000
and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.

382
0:16:01.381,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We might have to tear those books up

383
0:16:03.258,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and start to look at other options

384
0:16:05.829,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and be open-minded to seek the truth.

385
0:16:08.686,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Ultimately, it's about transforming the world

386
0:16:10.933,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and making it a better place.

387
0:16:12.619,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Thank you very much.

388
0:16:14.837,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

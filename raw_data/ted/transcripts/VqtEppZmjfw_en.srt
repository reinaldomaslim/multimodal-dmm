1
0:00:15.731,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The great texts of the ancient world

2
0:00:18.215,000 --> 0:00:21,000
don't survive to us in their original form.

3
0:00:21.53,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They survive because medieval scribes copied them

4
0:00:25.049,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and copied them and copied them.

5
0:00:27.048,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And so it is with Archimedes,

6
0:00:29.698,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the great Greek mathematician.

7
0:00:31.464,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician

8
0:00:34.466,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we know about because of just three books,

9
0:00:37.164,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and they're called A, B and C.

10
0:00:39.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.

11
0:00:43.913,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library

12
0:00:46.716,000 --> 0:00:51,000
about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.

13
0:00:52.548,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906,

14
0:00:56.845,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it landed on my desk in Baltimore

15
0:00:59.394,000 --> 0:01:03,000
on the 19th of January, 1999.

16
0:01:03.52,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And this is Codex C here.

17
0:01:05.938,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.

18
0:01:11.107,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's buried treasure.

19
0:01:12.557,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Because this book is actually a prayer book.

20
0:01:14.892,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones

21
0:01:17.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on the 14th of April, 1229.

22
0:01:21.473,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And to make his prayer book he used parchment.

23
0:01:23.958,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But he didn't use new parchment,

24
0:01:26.373,000 --> 0:01:29,000
he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,

25
0:01:29.687,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and there were seven of them.

26
0:01:31.424,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.

27
0:01:34.907,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.

28
0:01:40.374,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He erased all of their texts,

29
0:01:43.757,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and then he cut the sheets down in the middle,

30
0:01:46.175,000 --> 0:01:48,000
he shuffled them up,

31
0:01:48.419,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and he rotated them 90 degrees,

32
0:01:50.337,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and he wrote prayers on top of these books.

33
0:01:52.389,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And essentially these seven manuscripts

34
0:01:54.086,000 --> 0:01:58,000
disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.

35
0:01:58.434,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The prayer book was discovered by this guy,

36
0:02:01.683,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.

37
0:02:04.41,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And with just a magnifying glass,

38
0:02:05.851,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he transcribed as much of the text as he could.

39
0:02:08.735,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript

40
0:02:11.917,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that were unique texts.

41
0:02:13.685,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They weren't in A and B at all;

42
0:02:15.285,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they were completely new texts by Archimedes,

43
0:02:16.983,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."

44
0:02:20.218,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And it became a world famous manuscript.

45
0:02:22.487,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now it should be clear by now

46
0:02:24.302,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that this book is in bad condition.

47
0:02:27.016,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It got in worse condition in the 20th century

48
0:02:30.486,000 --> 0:02:31,000
after Heiberg saw it.

49
0:02:32.218,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Forgeries were painted over it,

50
0:02:33.735,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it suffered very badly from mold.

51
0:02:36.818,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This book is the definition of a write-off.

52
0:02:40.568,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's the sort of book

53
0:02:42.302,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that you thought would be in an institution.

54
0:02:44.967,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But it's not in an institution,

55
0:02:47.153,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it was bought by a private owner in 1998.

56
0:02:51.785,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Why did he buy this book?

57
0:02:53.535,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.

58
0:02:57.072,000 --> 0:03:,000
He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.

59
0:03:00.318,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He wanted to make that which was expensive free.

60
0:03:04.984,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.

61
0:03:08.119,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,

62
0:03:12.651,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but they should have the chance to do it.

63
0:03:15.335,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,

64
0:03:18.634,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and he promised to pay for all the work.

65
0:03:20.77,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And it was an expensive job,

66
0:03:22.468,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think

67
0:03:25.938,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because these people, they didn't come from money,

68
0:03:28.103,000 --> 0:03:29,000
they came from Archimedes.

69
0:03:29.922,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.

70
0:03:31.638,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They came from particle physics,

71
0:03:33.821,000 --> 0:03:34,000
they came from classical philology,

72
0:03:35.387,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they came from book conservation,

73
0:03:37.355,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they came from ancient mathematics,

74
0:03:39.937,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they came from data management,

75
0:03:41.854,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they came from scientific imaging and program management.

76
0:03:44.771,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And they got together to work on this manuscript.

77
0:03:48.327,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The first problem was a conservation problem.

78
0:03:52.138,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:

79
0:03:54.571,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There was glue on the spine of the book.

80
0:03:56.771,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And if you look at this photograph carefully,

81
0:03:58.972,000 --> 0:04:,000
the bottom half of this is rather brown.

82
0:04:01.02,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And that glue is hide glue.

83
0:04:02.388,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now if you're a conservator,

84
0:04:03.773,000 --> 0:04:05,000
you can take off this glue reasonably easily.

85
0:04:05.905,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The top half is Elmer's wood glue.

86
0:04:09.27,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion

87
0:04:11.387,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.

88
0:04:14.054,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.

89
0:04:17.22,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes,

90
0:04:20.571,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we had to take this book apart.

91
0:04:22.02,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So it took four years to take apart.

92
0:04:24.871,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.

93
0:04:28.404,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:31.175,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,

95
0:04:35.441,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because this was used in the liturgical services

96
0:04:37.676,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of the Greek Orthodox Church

97
0:04:39.417,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and they'd used candle wax.

98
0:04:40.728,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the candle wax was dirty,

99
0:04:42.591,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we couldn't image through the wax.

100
0:04:43.824,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.

101
0:04:47.159,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's hard to tell you exactly

102
0:04:49.061,000 --> 0:04:51,000
how bad this condition of this book is,

103
0:04:51.775,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but it came out in little bits very often.

104
0:04:54.541,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,

105
0:04:56.891,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.

106
0:04:59.891,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, tiny fragments

107
0:05:02.19,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we actually managed to put back in the right place.

108
0:05:06.931,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.

109
0:05:10.641,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And we imaged the manuscript

110
0:05:12.141,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in 14 different wavebands of light.

111
0:05:14.169,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light,

112
0:05:18.075,000 --> 0:05:19,000
you see different things.

113
0:05:19.291,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And here is an image of a page

114
0:05:20.858,000 --> 0:05:22,000
imaged in 14 different wavebands of light.

115
0:05:23.375,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But none of them worked.

116
0:05:25.508,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So what we did was we processed the images together,

117
0:05:29.925,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we put two images into one blank screen.

118
0:05:33.225,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.

119
0:05:36.058,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And the image on the left

120
0:05:37.874,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is the normal red image.

121
0:05:39.225,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.

122
0:05:41.137,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And in the image on the right

123
0:05:42.277,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.

124
0:05:44.725,000 --> 0:05:46,000
If you merge them together into one digital canvas,

125
0:05:47.707,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the parchment is bright in both images

126
0:05:50.525,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and it comes out bright.

127
0:05:52.4,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The prayer book is dark in both images

128
0:05:55.416,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and it comes out dark.

129
0:05:57.113,000 --> 0:06:,000
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.

130
0:06:00.464,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And it'll come out dark but red,

131
0:06:02.864,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and then you can start to read it rather clearly.

132
0:06:05.131,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And that's what it looks like.

133
0:06:07.973,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now that's a before and after image,

134
0:06:11.315,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but you don't read the image on the screen like that.

135
0:06:14.297,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You zoom in and you zoom in

136
0:06:16.916,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and you zoom in and you zoom in,

137
0:06:20.464,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and you can just read it now.

138
0:06:22.532,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

139
0:06:28.88,000 --> 0:06:31,000
If you process the same two images in a different way,

140
0:06:32.46,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.

141
0:06:35.03,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And this is terribly important,

142
0:06:36.048,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because the diagrams in the manuscript

143
0:06:39.031,000 --> 0:06:41,000
are the unique source for the diagrams

144
0:06:41.498,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.

145
0:06:44.315,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And there we are, I can give them to you.

146
0:06:47.354,000 --> 0:06:49,000
With this kind of imaging --

147
0:06:49.698,000 --> 0:06:51,000
this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging --

148
0:06:52.364,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.

149
0:06:54.964,000 --> 0:06:55,000
How were we going to do that?

150
0:06:56.817,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Well we took the manuscript,

151
0:06:58.78,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.

152
0:07:03.067,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left

153
0:07:06.081,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.

154
0:07:09.933,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And that electron disappears.

155
0:07:11.931,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out

156
0:07:15.566,000 --> 0:07:17,000
jumps in and takes its place.

157
0:07:18.048,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And when it takes its place,

158
0:07:19.481,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it sheds electromagnetic radiation.

159
0:07:22.315,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It sheds an X-ray.

160
0:07:23.747,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength

161
0:07:26.398,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to the atom that it hits.

162
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And what we wanted to get

163
0:07:30.448,000 --> 0:07:31,000
was the iron.

164
0:07:32.181,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Because the ink was written in iron.

165
0:07:34.048,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And if we can map

166
0:07:35.731,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,

167
0:07:38.315,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we can map all the iron on the page,

168
0:07:40.381,000 --> 0:07:42,000
then theoretically we can read the image.

169
0:07:42.98,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.

170
0:07:47.315,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory

171
0:07:50.689,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in California,

172
0:07:52.131,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which is a particle accelerator.

173
0:07:53.699,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Electrons go around one way,

174
0:07:55.431,000 --> 0:07:56,000
positrons go around the other.

175
0:07:57.048,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They meet in the middle,

176
0:07:58.364,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they create subatomic particles

177
0:08:00.8,000 --> 0:08:02,000
like the charm quark and the tau lepton.

178
0:08:03.03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.

179
0:08:06.052,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But as the electrons go round at the speed of light,

180
0:08:09.6,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they shed X-rays.

181
0:08:10.867,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.

182
0:08:13.517,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This is called synchrotron radiation,

183
0:08:15.466,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and it's normally used to look at things

184
0:08:17.284,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like proteins and that sort of thing.

185
0:08:18.951,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,

186
0:08:22.948,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so that we could read the page from before and after.

187
0:08:25.817,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.

188
0:08:28.115,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It took about 17 minutes to do a single page.

189
0:08:31.563,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So what did we discover?

190
0:08:34.218,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes

191
0:08:36.4,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is called "The Stomachion."

192
0:08:38.203,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And this didn't exist in Codices A and B.

193
0:08:40.617,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And we knew that it involved this square.

194
0:08:43.036,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And this is a perfect square,

195
0:08:44.829,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and it's divided into 14 bits.

196
0:08:46.85,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.

197
0:08:49.633,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And now we think we know.

198
0:08:51.817,000 --> 0:08:52,000
He was trying to work out

199
0:08:53.584,000 --> 0:08:55,000
how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits

200
0:08:56.117,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and still make a perfect square.

201
0:08:58.444,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Anyone want to guess the answer?

202
0:09:01.946,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.

203
0:09:07.308,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And the important point about this

204
0:09:09.675,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.

205
0:09:13.389,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.

206
0:09:17.153,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript

207
0:09:20.388,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is that we looked at the other manuscripts

208
0:09:22.757,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that the palimpsester had made,

209
0:09:24.175,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the scribe had made his book out of,

210
0:09:26.741,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.

211
0:09:29.673,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.

212
0:09:34.041,000 --> 0:09:36,000
He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.

213
0:09:36.458,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together

214
0:09:40.857,000 --> 0:09:41,000
decided that they wanted to stand up

215
0:09:42.541,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to the military might of Philip of Macedon.

216
0:09:44.541,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.

217
0:09:48.19,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This was a bad idea,

218
0:09:49.458,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,

219
0:09:52.891,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and they lost the battle of Chaeronea.

220
0:09:55.174,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;

221
0:09:57.892,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.

222
0:10:00.642,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial --

223
0:10:04.242,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and it's a great speech:

224
0:10:05.39,000 --> 0:10:07,000
"Best of all," he says, "is to win.

225
0:10:07.658,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But if you can't win,

226
0:10:09.392,000 --> 0:10:11,000
then you should fight for a noble cause,

227
0:10:11.433,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because then you'll be remembered.

228
0:10:13.008,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Consider the Spartans.

229
0:10:14.606,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They won enumerable victories,

230
0:10:16.474,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but no one remembers what they are

231
0:10:18.306,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because they were all fought for selfish ends.

232
0:10:20.441,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers

233
0:10:24.007,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is the the battle of Thermopylae

234
0:10:25.723,000 --> 0:10:27,000
where they were butchered to a man,

235
0:10:27.726,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but fought for the freedom of Greece."

236
0:10:29.658,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It was such a great speech

237
0:10:31.923,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that the Athenian law courts let him off.

238
0:10:35.658,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He lived for another 10 years,

239
0:10:37.724,000 --> 0:10:39,000
then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.

240
0:10:40.375,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,

241
0:10:42.959,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and no one knows what they did with his body.

242
0:10:46.39,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,

243
0:10:49.541,000 --> 0:10:5,000
speaking to us, not from the grave,

244
0:10:51.523,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because his grave doesn't exist,

245
0:10:53.001,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but from the Athenian law courts.

246
0:10:54.774,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now I should say at this point

247
0:10:56.423,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that normally when you're looking

248
0:10:59.19,000 --> 0:11:,000
at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,

249
0:11:01.186,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you don't find unique texts.

250
0:11:02.672,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And to find two in one manuscript is really something.

251
0:11:05.774,000 --> 0:11:08,000
To find three is completely weird.

252
0:11:08.991,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And we found three.

253
0:11:10.672,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Aristotle's "Categories"

254
0:11:11.938,000 --> 0:11:13,000
is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.

255
0:11:14.391,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,

256
0:11:18.807,000 --> 0:11:21,000
possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.

257
0:11:21.991,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now all this data that we collected,

258
0:11:24.189,000 --> 0:11:26,000
all the images, all the raw images,

259
0:11:26.724,000 --> 0:11:28,000
all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing

260
0:11:29.074,000 --> 0:11:32,000
have been put online under a Creative Commons license

261
0:11:32.56,000 --> 0:11:34,000
for anyone to use for any commercial purpose.

262
0:11:35.474,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Applause)

263
0:11:42.007,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Why did the owner of the manuscript do this?

264
0:11:45.311,000 --> 0:11:48,000
He did this because he understands data as well as books.

265
0:11:49.057,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now the thing to do with books,

266
0:11:50.392,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if you want to ensure their long-term utility,

267
0:11:52.523,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is to hide them away in closets

268
0:11:54.739,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and let very few people look at them.

269
0:11:56.539,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,

270
0:11:58.958,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is to let it out and have everybody have it

271
0:12:02.259,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with as little control on that data as possible.

272
0:12:05.358,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And that's what he did.

273
0:12:06.522,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And institutions can learn from this.

274
0:12:09.95,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Because institutions at the moment

275
0:12:12.502,000 --> 0:12:15,000
confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.

276
0:12:15.559,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,

277
0:12:17.751,000 --> 0:12:2,000
at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site

278
0:12:21.222,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or the University Library of X's site,

279
0:12:23.89,000 --> 0:12:24,000
which is about the most boring way

280
0:12:25.789,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in which you can deal with digital data.

281
0:12:27.566,000 --> 0:12:29,000
What you want to do is to aggregate it all together.

282
0:12:30.559,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future

283
0:12:33.656,000 --> 0:12:35,000
isn't going to be built by institutions.

284
0:12:35.942,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's going to be built by users,

285
0:12:39.05,000 --> 0:12:4,000
by people who get this data together,

286
0:12:40.824,000 --> 0:12:43,000
by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps

287
0:12:44.359,000 --> 0:12:45,000
from wherever they come from,

288
0:12:45.991,000 --> 0:12:46,000
all sorts of medieval romances

289
0:12:47.791,000 --> 0:12:48,000
from wherever they come from,

290
0:12:49.34,000 --> 0:12:52,000
people who just want to curate their own glorious selection

291
0:12:53.123,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of beautiful things.

292
0:12:54.64,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And that is the future of the Web.

293
0:12:56.257,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And it's an attractive and beautiful future,

294
0:12:59.44,000 --> 0:13:,000
if only we can make it happen.

295
0:13:01.042,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,

296
0:13:04.223,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web

297
0:13:07.573,000 --> 0:13:08,000
for people to enjoy --

298
0:13:09.256,000 --> 0:13:11,000
all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.

299
0:13:11.84,000 --> 0:13:13,000
under a Creative Commons license.

300
0:13:14.723,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum

301
0:13:16.241,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and it has beautiful manuscripts,

302
0:13:17.789,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but the data is fantastic.

303
0:13:19.807,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And the result of this

304
0:13:21.59,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is that if you do a Google search on images right now

305
0:13:24.608,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and you type in "Illuminated manuscript Koran" for example,

306
0:13:27.94,000 --> 0:13:31,000
24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution.

307
0:13:32.357,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Applause)

308
0:13:37.907,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Now, let's think about this for a minute.

309
0:13:42.94,000 --> 0:13:43,000
What's in it for the institution?

310
0:13:44.923,000 --> 0:13:46,000
There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.

311
0:13:47.519,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,

312
0:13:49.642,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but let's talk about selfish things.

313
0:13:51.523,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Because what's really in it for the institution is this:

314
0:13:55.391,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Now why do people go to the Louvre?

315
0:13:58.447,000 --> 0:14:,000
They go to see the Mona Lisa.

316
0:14:01.431,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa?

317
0:14:04.49,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Because they already know what she looks like.

318
0:14:06.872,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And they know what she looks like

319
0:14:09.206,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.

320
0:14:13.908,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Now, there is no need

321
0:14:18.357,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for these restrictions at all.

322
0:14:20.636,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And I think that institutions should stand up

323
0:14:22.723,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and release all their data under unrestricted licenses,

324
0:14:25.857,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and it would be a great benefit to everybody.

325
0:14:28.073,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data

326
0:14:31.239,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and curate their own collection

327
0:14:33.575,000 --> 0:14:35,000
of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things

328
0:14:35.74,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and increase the beauty and the cultural significance

329
0:14:38.828,000 --> 0:14:39,000
of the Internet.

330
0:14:40.056,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you very much indeed.

331
0:14:41.573,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.288,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I love to collect things.

3
0:00:18.447,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections

4
0:00:20.437,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces

5
0:00:23.166,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from all around the world to insects

6
0:00:26.404,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that I've captured and put in jars.

7
0:00:28.808,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,

8
0:00:30.845,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I love the Natural History Museum

9
0:00:32.781,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the collections of animals

10
0:00:34.181,000 --> 0:00:35,000
at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.

11
0:00:35.996,000 --> 0:00:37,000
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,

12
0:00:38.133,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that you can go and look at,

13
0:00:39.55,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and they memorialize a specific point of time

14
0:00:41.285,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in this animal's life.

15
0:00:42.932,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So I was thinking about my own life,

16
0:00:44.814,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,

17
0:00:46.727,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for the ages, and also — (Laughter) —

18
0:00:49.51,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the lives of my friends, but

19
0:00:51.997,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen

20
0:00:54.613,000 --> 0:00:57,000
on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)

21
0:00:57.789,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So instead, I turned to video,

22
0:01:00.492,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize

23
0:01:02.79,000 --> 0:01:04,000
someone and to capture a specific moment in time.

24
0:01:05.564,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends

25
0:01:07.741,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and then, using video mapping and video projection,

26
0:01:10.141,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends

27
0:01:12.622,000 --> 0:01:15,000
projected into jars. (Laughter)

28
0:01:16.564,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So now I have this collection of my friends

29
0:01:18.278,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I can take around with me whenever I go,

30
0:01:20.067,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and this is called Animalia Chordata,

31
0:01:21.979,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from the Latin nomenclature for

32
0:01:23.796,000 --> 0:01:25,000
human being, classification system.

33
0:01:25.956,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,

34
0:01:28.918,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and they actually move around. (Laughter)

35
0:01:33.277,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So, this is interesting to me,

36
0:01:35.37,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add

38
0:01:41.082,000 --> 0:01:42,000
an interaction system. So what I did was,

39
0:01:42.694,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close

40
0:01:44.477,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.

41
0:01:46.636,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You know, just like people on the street

42
0:01:48.363,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when you get too close to them.

43
0:01:50.219,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Some people reacted in terror. (Laughter)

44
0:01:52.805,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Others reacted in asking you for help,

45
0:01:54.818,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and some people hide from you.

46
0:01:58.316,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So this was really interesting to me, this idea of

47
0:01:59.947,000 --> 0:02:01,000
taking video off the screen and putting it in real life,

48
0:02:02.082,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and also adding interactivity to sculpture.

49
0:02:04.329,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends

50
0:02:08.394,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and trapped them in jars as well

51
0:02:10.226,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and created a piece known as Garden,

52
0:02:12.171,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is literally a garden of humanity.

53
0:02:14.523,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But something about the first piece,

54
0:02:16.667,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,

55
0:02:18.572,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this idea of interaction with art,

56
0:02:20.393,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,

57
0:02:22.715,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and also being challenged by interacting with art.

58
0:02:25.004,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I wanted to create a new piece that actually

59
0:02:26.859,000 --> 0:02:27,000
forced people to come and interact with something,

60
0:02:28.748,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the way I did this was actually by projecting

61
0:02:30.447,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)

62
0:02:34.827,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is

63
0:02:37.322,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.

64
0:02:39.185,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You may never experience the entire thing yourself.

65
0:02:41.526,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character

66
0:02:43.85,000 --> 0:02:45,000
stands there in the blender and looks at you,

67
0:02:46.275,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or you can actually choose to interact with it.

68
0:02:48.349,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So if you do choose to interact with the piece,

69
0:02:52.482,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and you press the blender button, it actually sends

70
0:02:54.642,000 --> 0:02:57,000
this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.

71
0:02:58.074,000 --> 0:03:01,000
By doing that, you are now part of my piece.

72
0:03:01.626,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You, like the people that are trapped in my work

73
0:03:03.658,000 --> 0:03:07,000
— (Blender noises, laughter) —

74
0:03:07.719,000 --> 0:03:14,000
have become part of my work as well. (Laughter)

75
0:03:14.826,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:17.019,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:19.442,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But, but this seems a bit unfair, right?

78
0:03:23.082,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I put my friends in jars, I put this character,

79
0:03:25.594,000 --> 0:03:27,000
this sort of endangered species character in a blender.

80
0:03:28.411,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But I'd never done anything about myself.

81
0:03:30.411,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'd never really memorialized myself.

82
0:03:32.123,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.

83
0:03:34.393,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece

84
0:03:36.618,000 --> 0:03:38,000
called A Point Just Passed,

85
0:03:38.865,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,

86
0:03:41.497,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and it's up to you.

87
0:03:43.201,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,

88
0:03:45.147,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you actually age me.

89
0:03:46.854,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,

90
0:03:49.41,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,

91
0:03:54.072,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.

92
0:03:57.303,000 --> 0:03:59,000
From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.

93
0:03:59.823,000 --> 0:04:02,000
From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,

94
0:04:02.911,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and then, from there, into an elderly man.

95
0:04:06.77,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times

96
0:04:09.702,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in one day, the piece goes black

97
0:04:12.773,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and is not to be reset until the next day.

98
0:04:15.466,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So, in doing so, you're erasing time.

99
0:04:17.55,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You're actually implicit in this work

100
0:04:19.478,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and you're erasing my life.

101
0:04:21.484,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So I like this about interactive video sculpture,

102
0:04:23.63,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that you can actually interact with it,

103
0:04:25.207,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that all of you can actually touch an artwork

104
0:04:27.079,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and be part of the artwork yourselves,

105
0:04:28.943,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you

106
0:04:31.414,000 --> 0:04:33,000
trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)

107
0:04:33.574,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Thank you. (Applause)

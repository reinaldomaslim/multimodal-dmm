When you think about money and your dreams

3
0:00:14.224,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and you're looking at your account,

4
0:00:15.974,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you're like, "My bank account does not align with my dreams."

[The Way We Work]

6
0:00:22.516,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Financial health for a typical American household can be stressful.

7
0:00:26.391,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We know that 46 percent of all Americans would struggle

8
0:00:30.099,000 --> 0:00:32,000
coming up with 400 dollars in the event of an emergency.

9
0:00:32.974,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And 60 percent of all Americans will face that emergency

10
0:00:36.974,000 --> 0:00:37,000
within 12 months or less.

11
0:00:38.308,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When you ask the question, "What does money mean to you,"

12
0:00:41.224,000 --> 0:00:44,000
most people will say things like, "I feel anxious."

13
0:00:44.474,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so the insecurities come. The shame comes.

14
0:00:47.224,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I think we have a fraught relationship with money,

15
0:00:49.808,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because it comes with judgment.

16
0:00:51.933,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When you're not able to pay your bills on time,

17
0:00:54.974,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you can personalize that.

18
0:00:56.266,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I don't want anyone to think that I'm not smart.

19
0:00:58.724,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I don't want anyone to know that I am very insecure with money.

20
0:01:02.349,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I don't want anyone to know that I am super stressed out.

21
0:01:05.391,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So now let's change the narrative.

22
0:01:07.558,000 --> 0:01:11,000
[6 lessons on how to improve our relationship with money]

23
0:01:11.974,000 --> 0:01:13,000
[1: Talk about it.]

24
0:01:14.391,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You can't do it alone. And that's when your squad has to come in.

25
0:01:17.516,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's taboo.

26
0:01:18.808,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We typically don't talk about our stresses when it comes to money.

27
0:01:21.974,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We need to come together as a group of friends,

28
0:01:24.224,000 --> 0:01:25,000
no judgment, no shame.

29
0:01:25.683,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Celebrate the fact that we've made a decision

30
0:01:28.683,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that we want to have a better relationship with money.

31
0:01:31.266,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That is worth applauding or snapping your fingers about.

32
0:01:33.933,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Once you've done that, then you get real.

33
0:01:36.391,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Nothing should be off-limits.

34
0:01:38.516,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Where does this relationship come from?

35
0:01:40.433,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Why am I spending all this money on things that don't align with my goals?

36
0:01:45.348,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What are your fears? What are your hopes? What are your dreams?

37
0:01:48.331,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But then we start to take action.

38
0:01:50.016,000 --> 0:01:52,000
What can we do this week? Or what can we do this month?

39
0:01:52.641,000 --> 0:01:54,000
[2: Understand what money is]

40
0:01:55.599,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Money is not the end-all be-all.

41
0:01:58.558,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's the mechanism to accomplish whatever your goals are.

42
0:02:02.099,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It does not define you.

43
0:02:03.849,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's just a mechanism to accomplish what matters to you most.

44
0:02:07.349,000 --> 0:02:09,000
[3: Identify what matters to you ... ]

45
0:02:09.849,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Ask yourself one fundamental question: what are you saving for?

46
0:02:13.433,000 --> 0:02:16,000
If you're saving for a car, if you're saving to pay down your debt,

47
0:02:16.641,000 --> 0:02:18,000
if you're saving for that rainy day fund,

48
0:02:18.724,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it will include short-term goals

49
0:02:21.058,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and it will include long-term goals.

50
0:02:22.891,000 --> 0:02:24,000
[4: ... and then really picture it.]

51
0:02:25.391,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Visualize what you're really trying to accomplish.

52
0:02:28.808,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A vision board is visual representation

53
0:02:32.183,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of what you're saving for.

54
0:02:33.558,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So if we break it down, go get a poster board.

55
0:02:35.891,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Get your markers, get your glitter.

56
0:02:37.933,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Take magazine pictures, cut it all out.

57
0:02:40.516,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Have that picture of that great trip.

58
0:02:42.599,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Have the picture of you paying down your student debt.

59
0:02:45.683,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The vision board sounds like, "Oh, how can that really help?"

60
0:02:49.349,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The point is your goals need to align with your behaviors,

61
0:02:52.308,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the vision board is really a representation

62
0:02:55.183,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of where you wanna go and then how you live your life,

63
0:02:58.183,000 --> 0:03:,000
and in the meantime are the steps to really get there.

64
0:03:00.849,000 --> 0:03:03,000
[5: It's not what you make, it's what you keep.]

65
0:03:03.891,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's not about what you make, it's about what you keep.

66
0:03:07.183,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's about understanding do I have the ability

67
0:03:10.141,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with what I'm making to take care of my basic needs?

68
0:03:13.349,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And if not, what adjustments do I need to make?

69
0:03:16.099,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then we start to break it down and talk about the tools.

70
0:03:19.766,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We start to say, "Do we have our savings account, auto-save?"

71
0:03:22.933,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Set it and forget it, or every day, put a dollar a day.

72
0:03:26.058,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Whatever that rhythm is for you,

73
0:03:28.224,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the goal is the rhythm, not the amount.

74
0:03:30.433,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You can start slow.

75
0:03:31.933,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You can start small, but you have to start now.

76
0:03:35.308,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then let me give you a trick, we all have impulses.

77
0:03:38.266,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Many times, because the phone is always with us,

78
0:03:40.558,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we start shopping.

79
0:03:41.849,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Go out to any site, shop up, put it in your cart.

80
0:03:44.224,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Just don't hit buy.

81
0:03:46.224,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Wait 24 hours, go back and ask yourself,

82
0:03:49.641,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Do I really need it?

83
0:03:50.933,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What about these items map to my goal?"

84
0:03:53.433,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And if it's nothing, hit delete and you got your fix.

85
0:03:56.683,000 --> 0:03:59,000
[6: Be good to yourself.]

86
0:04:00.183,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's also important to know

87
0:04:02.266,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that your self-worth is not determined by your net worth.

88
0:04:05.849,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is something that we can do better about.

89
0:04:08.058,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You celebrate your wins.

90
0:04:10.058,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And when you make that misstep, no judgment, no shame.

91
0:04:13.683,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Just get back at it.

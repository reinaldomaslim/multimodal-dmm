1
0:00:13.606,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As you heard, I'm a physicist.

2
0:00:15.329,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And I think the way we talk about physics needs a little modification.

3
0:00:19.338,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I am from just down the road here; I don't live here anymore.

4
0:00:22.723,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But coming from round here means that I have a northern nana,

5
0:00:27.254,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my mum's mom.

6
0:00:28.445,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And Nana is very bright; she hasn't had much formal education,

7
0:00:32.496,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but she's sharp.

8
0:00:33.688,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And when I was a second-year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge,

9
0:00:37.79,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I remember spending an afternoon at Nana's house in Urmston

10
0:00:42.657,000 --> 0:00:43,000
studying quantum mechanics.

11
0:00:44.063,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I had these folders open in front of me

12
0:00:46.378,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.

13
0:00:49.3,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And Nana came along, and she looked at this folder,

14
0:00:54.028,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and she said, "What's that?"

15
0:00:56.357,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."

16
0:00:59.023,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I tried to explain something about what was on the page.

17
0:01:03.853,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was to do with the nucleus and Einstein A and B coefficients.

18
0:01:07.866,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And Nana looked very impressed.

19
0:01:10.413,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And then she said, "Oh.

20
0:01:12.873,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What can you do when you know that?"

21
0:01:14.897,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:19.315,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"Don't know, ma'am."

23
0:01:20.568,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:21.656,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I think I said something about computers,

25
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because it was all I could think of at the time.

26
0:01:26.782,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But you can broaden that question out, because it's a very good question --

27
0:01:30.45,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"What can you do when you know that?" when "that" is physics?

28
0:01:33.376,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I've come to realize that when we talk about physics in society

29
0:01:36.868,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and our sort of image of it,

30
0:01:38.294,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we don't include the things that we can do when we know that.

31
0:01:41.47,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift.

32
0:01:44.207,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Not only does it need a bit of a shift,

33
0:01:46.135,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but sharing this different perspective matters for our society,

34
0:01:51.715,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist and I'm biased

35
0:01:54.947,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I think we're the most important people in the world.

36
0:01:57.738,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Honest.

37
0:01:58.913,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, the image of physics -- we've got an image problem, let's be honest --

38
0:02:02.579,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it hasn't moved on much from this.

39
0:02:04.417,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is a very famous photograph that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.

40
0:02:08.573,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is when the great minds of physics were grappling

41
0:02:12.842,000 --> 0:02:14,000
with the nature of determinism

42
0:02:15.112,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and what it means only to have a probability

43
0:02:17.216,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that a particle might be somewhere,

44
0:02:18.951,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and whether any of it was real.

45
0:02:20.557,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it was all very difficult.

46
0:02:22.048,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And you'll notice they're all very stern-looking men in suits.

47
0:02:25.035,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying, "Marie Antoinette,"

48
0:02:27.969,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which would be a turn-up for the books --

49
0:02:29.957,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Marie Curie, third from the left on the bottom there,

50
0:02:32.577,000 --> 0:02:34,000
she was allowed in, but had to dress like everybody else.

51
0:02:35.316,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:36.365,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So, this is what physics is like -- there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,

53
0:02:40.279,000 --> 0:02:42,000
these are to do with waves and particles.

54
0:02:42.476,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding,

55
0:02:45.68,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which makes it look worth watching, to be honest.

56
0:02:47.992,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I'm glad I didn't have to write the risk assessment

57
0:02:50.408,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for whatever was going on there.

58
0:02:51.964,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The point is: this is the image of physics, right?

59
0:02:54.341,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's weird and difficult,

60
0:02:55.564,000 --> 0:02:58,000
done by slightly strange people dressed in a slightly strange way.

61
0:02:58.712,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else

62
0:03:00.737,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and fundamentally, why should I care?

63
0:03:03.07,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the problem with that is that I'm a physicist,

64
0:03:07.363,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I study this.

65
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This -- this is my job, right?

66
0:03:11.17,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.

67
0:03:14.894,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive,

68
0:03:17.206,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the thin layer that joins them together

69
0:03:19.331,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is really important,

70
0:03:20.517,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other.

71
0:03:23.758,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You can see that the sea surface -- that was me who took this video --

72
0:03:27.496,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the average height of those waves by the way, was 10 meters.

73
0:03:30.655,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So this is definitely physics happening here --

74
0:03:33.174,000 --> 0:03:35,000
there's lots of things -- this is definitely physics.

75
0:03:35.746,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics,

76
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and that bothers me.

77
0:03:41.17,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So what is included in our cultural perception of physics?

78
0:03:44.522,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Because I'm a physicist, there has to be a graph, right?

79
0:03:47.356,000 --> 0:03:48,000
That's allowed.

80
0:03:48.536,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We've got time along the bottom here, from very fast things there,

81
0:03:52.821,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to things that take a long time over here.

82
0:03:56.286,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Small things at the bottom, big things up there.

83
0:03:58.805,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, our current cultural image of physics looks like this.

84
0:04:01.854,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There's quantum mechanics down in that corner,

85
0:04:04.399,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it's very small, it's very weird,

86
0:04:06.423,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it happens very quickly,

87
0:04:08.448,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it's a long way down in the general ...

88
0:04:11.753,000 --> 0:04:13,000
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life.

89
0:04:14.611,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And then there's cosmology, which is up there;

90
0:04:16.967,000 --> 0:04:17,000
very large, very far away,

91
0:04:18.302,000 --> 0:04:2,000
also very weird.

92
0:04:20.326,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if you go to some places

93
0:04:22.35,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like black holes in the beginning of the universe,

94
0:04:25.438,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we know that these are frontiers in physics, right?

95
0:04:28.464,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There's lots of work being done to discover new physics

96
0:04:31.243,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in these places.

97
0:04:33.137,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But the thing is, you will notice there's a very large gap in the middle.

98
0:04:36.678,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And in that gap, there are many things.

99
0:04:38.86,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There are planets and toasts and volcanoes and clouds

100
0:04:41.527,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins

101
0:04:43.688,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and all sorts of things that make up our everyday life.

102
0:04:46.971,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And these are also run by physics, you'd be surprised --

103
0:04:50.108,000 --> 0:04:53,000
there is physics in the middle, it's just that nobody talks about it.

104
0:04:53.431,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the thing about all of these is that they all run

105
0:04:57.426,000 --> 0:05:,000
on a relatively small number of physical laws,

106
0:05:00.981,000 --> 0:05:01,000
things like Newton's laws of motion,

107
0:05:02.883,000 --> 0:05:03,000
thermodynamics,

108
0:05:04.07,000 --> 0:05:05,000
some rotational dynamics.

109
0:05:05.809,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The physics in the middle applies over a huge range,

110
0:05:09.361,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from very, very small things to very, very big things.

111
0:05:12.006,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You have to try very hard to get outside of this.

112
0:05:14.404,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And there is also a frontier in research physics here,

113
0:05:18.229,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it's just that nobody talks about it.

114
0:05:20.056,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This is the world of the complex.

115
0:05:21.757,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When these laws work together, they bring about

116
0:05:24.028,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the beautiful, messy, complex world we live in.

117
0:05:26.882,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Fundamentally, this is the bit that really matters to me

118
0:05:30.579,000 --> 0:05:31,000
on an everyday basis.

119
0:05:31.793,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And this is the bit that we don't talk about.

120
0:05:33.996,000 --> 0:05:35,000
There's plenty of physics research going on here.

121
0:05:36.354,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But because it doesn't involve pointing at stars,

122
0:05:38.752,000 --> 0:05:4,000
people for some reason think it's not that.

123
0:05:40.858,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, the cool thing about this is that there are so many things

124
0:05:44.364,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in this middle bit,

125
0:05:46.388,000 --> 0:05:48,000
all following the same physical laws,

126
0:05:49.246,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that we can see those laws at work

127
0:05:51.595,000 --> 0:05:53,000
almost all the time around us.

128
0:05:53.619,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I've got a little video here.

129
0:05:55.058,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw and one of them has been boiled.

130
0:05:59.045,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I want you to tell me which one is which.

131
0:06:02.553,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Which one's raw?

132
0:06:04.359,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Audience responds)

133
0:06:05.529,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The one on the left -- yes!

134
0:06:07.027,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And even though you might not have tried that, you all knew.

135
0:06:09.891,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The reason for that is, you set them spinning,

136
0:06:12.465,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and when you stop the cooked egg, the one that's completely solid,

137
0:06:15.672,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you stop the entire egg.

138
0:06:16.848,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When you stop the other one, you only stop the shell;

139
0:06:19.435,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop.

140
0:06:22.805,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And then it pushes the shell round again, so the egg starts to rotate again.

141
0:06:27.111,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is brilliant, right?

142
0:06:29.177,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's a demonstration of something in physics

143
0:06:31.466,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that we call the law of conservation of angular momentum,

144
0:06:34.836,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which basically says that if you set something spinning

145
0:06:37.582,000 --> 0:06:38,000
about a fixed axis,

146
0:06:38.761,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that it will keep spinning unless you do something to stop it.

147
0:06:41.88,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that's really fundamental in how the universe works.

148
0:06:45.084,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And it's not just eggs that it applies to,

149
0:06:47.708,000 --> 0:06:49,000
although it's really useful if you're the sort of person --

150
0:06:50.544,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and apparently, these people do exist --

151
0:06:52.511,000 --> 0:06:54,000
who will boil eggs and then put them back in the fridge.

152
0:06:55.322,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Who does that? Don't admit to it -- it's OK. We won't judge you.

153
0:06:58.451,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But it's also got much broader applicabilities.

154
0:07:01.544,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.

155
0:07:03.54,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very tiny part of the sky.

156
0:07:06.756,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years,

157
0:07:09.901,000 --> 0:07:1,000
not touching anything.

158
0:07:11.493,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And yet it can point to a tiny region of sky.

159
0:07:14.223,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For 11 and a half days, it did it in sections,

160
0:07:18.549,000 --> 0:07:2,000
accurately enough to take amazing images like this.

161
0:07:21.227,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So the question is:

162
0:07:22.41,000 --> 0:07:24,000
How does something that is not touching anything

163
0:07:24.848,000 --> 0:07:25,000
know where it is?

164
0:07:26.033,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The answer is that right in the middle of it, it has something

165
0:07:29.018,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that, to my great disappointment, isn't a raw egg,

166
0:07:31.413,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but basically does the same job.

167
0:07:32.976,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,

168
0:07:34.879,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and because of the law of conservation of angular momentum,

169
0:07:37.707,000 --> 0:07:39,000
they keep spinning with the same axis, indefinitely.

170
0:07:40.305,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Hubble kind of rotates around them, and so it can orient itself.

171
0:07:43.418,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use,

172
0:07:47.586,000 --> 0:07:51,000
also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology

173
0:07:52.163,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of our time.

174
0:07:53.938,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So this is the fun bit of physics, that you learn these patterns

175
0:07:57.569,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then you can apply them again and again and again.

176
0:08:00.154,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And it's really rewarding when you spot them in new places.

177
0:08:03.054,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is the fun of physics.

178
0:08:04.571,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I have shown that egg video to an audience full of businesspeople once

179
0:08:09.049,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and they were all dressed up very smartly and trying to impress their bosses.

180
0:08:13.723,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And I was running out of time, so I showed the egg video and then said,

181
0:08:17.526,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Well, you can work it out, and ask me afterwards to check."

182
0:08:20.41,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Then I left the stage.

183
0:08:21.591,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I had, literally,

184
0:08:22.768,000 --> 0:08:24,000
middle-aged grown men tugging on my sleeve afterwards,

185
0:08:25.369,000 --> 0:08:26,000
saying, "Is it this? Is it this?"

186
0:08:27.029,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"

187
0:08:29.057,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:30.101,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The joy that you get from spotting these patterns

189
0:08:32.583,000 --> 0:08:34,000
doesn't go away when you're an adult.

190
0:08:34.724,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And that's really important,

191
0:08:36.503,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because physics is all about patterns,

192
0:08:39.006,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and a small number of patterns give you access

193
0:08:41.676,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to almost all of the physics in our everyday world.

194
0:08:45.167,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The thing that's best about this is it involves playing with toys.

195
0:08:48.762,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed as the mundane little things

196
0:08:52.277,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that we just give the kids to play with on a Saturday afternoon

197
0:08:55.387,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to keep them quiet.

198
0:08:56.576,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is the stuff that actually really matters,

199
0:08:58.856,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because this is the laws of the universe and it applies to eggs

200
0:09:01.904,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and toast falling butter-side down and all sorts of other things,

201
0:09:05.207,000 --> 0:09:07,000
just as much as it applies to modern technology

202
0:09:07.665,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and anything else that's going on in the world.

203
0:09:09.902,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So I think we should play with these patterns.

204
0:09:13.64,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Basically, there are a small number of concepts

205
0:09:15.879,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen,

206
0:09:18.908,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that are really useful for life in the outside world.

207
0:09:21.697,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If you want to learn about thermodynamics, a duck is a good place to start,

208
0:09:25.278,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for example, why their feet don't get cold.

209
0:09:27.354,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Once you've got a bit of thermodynamics with the duck,

210
0:09:29.929,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you can also explain fridges.

211
0:09:31.372,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Magnets that you can play with in your kitchen

212
0:09:34.157,000 --> 0:09:38,000
get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation.

213
0:09:38.221,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always a good thing to play with.

214
0:09:41.289,000 --> 0:09:44,000
If you're at a boring party, fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,

215
0:09:44.592,000 --> 0:09:46,000
put them in some lemonade.

216
0:09:46.616,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's got three consequences.

217
0:09:48.227,000 --> 0:09:5,000
First thing is, it's quite good to watch; try it.

218
0:09:50.618,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.

219
0:09:53.157,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Thirdly, it brings the interesting people to you.

220
0:09:55.544,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You win on all fronts.

221
0:09:56.931,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And then there's spin and gas laws and viscosity.

222
0:10:00.302,000 --> 0:10:03,000
There's these little patterns, and they're right around us everywhere.

223
0:10:03.818,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?

224
0:10:07.403,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Everybody has access to the same physics; you don't need a big, posh lab.

225
0:10:11.079,000 --> 0:10:14,000
When I wrote the book, I had the chapter on spin.

226
0:10:15.057,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I had written a bit about toast falling butter-side down.

227
0:10:17.763,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine who's not a scientist,

228
0:10:20.859,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for him to read and tell me what he thought,

229
0:10:22.997,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and he took the chapter away.

230
0:10:26.099,000 --> 0:10:27,000
He was working overseas.

231
0:10:27.332,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later,

232
0:10:30.333,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and it said, "I'm at breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland,

233
0:10:34.566,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I really want to push toast off the table,

234
0:10:37.322,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because I don't believe what you wrote."

235
0:10:39.888,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And that was the good bit -- he doesn't have to.

236
0:10:42.227,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He can push the toast off the table and try it for himself.

237
0:10:45.707,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And so there's two important things to know about science:

238
0:10:49.568,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the fundamental laws we've learned through experience and experimentation,

239
0:10:53.906,000 --> 0:10:54,000
work.

240
0:10:55.084,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The day we drop an apple and it goes up,

241
0:10:57.09,000 --> 0:10:58,000
then we'll have a debate about gravity.

242
0:10:59.03,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Up to that point, we basically know how gravity works,

243
0:11:01.644,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and we can learn the framework.

244
0:11:03.202,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Then there's the process of experimentation:

245
0:11:05.513,000 --> 0:11:07,000
having confidence in things, trying things out,

246
0:11:07.74,000 --> 0:11:09,000
critical thinking -- how we move science forward --

247
0:11:10.233,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and you can learn both of those things

248
0:11:12.257,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by playing with toys in the everyday world.

249
0:11:15.376,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And it's really important,

250
0:11:17.547,000 --> 0:11:19,000
because there's all this talk about technology,

251
0:11:19.786,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we've heard talks about quantum computing

252
0:11:21.811,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and all these mysterious, far-off things.

253
0:11:23.836,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies that are about this size,

254
0:11:27.694,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we still walk about, sit on chairs that are about this size,

255
0:11:30.655,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we still live in the physical world.

256
0:11:32.679,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless.

257
0:11:36.651,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And I think it's really important that we're not helpless,

258
0:11:39.526,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that society feels it can look at things,

259
0:11:41.758,000 --> 0:11:43,000
because this isn't about knowing all the answers.

260
0:11:44.448,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions.

261
0:11:47.889,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life,

262
0:11:51.427,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we gain the confidence to ask the right questions.

263
0:11:54.186,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So, there's a bigger thing.

264
0:11:55.896,000 --> 0:11:56,000
In answer to Nana's question

265
0:11:57.294,000 --> 0:11:59,000
about what can you do when you know that --

266
0:11:59.328,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because there's lots of stuff in the everyday world

267
0:12:01.805,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that you can do when you know that,

268
0:12:03.526,000 --> 0:12:05,000
especially if you've got eggs in the fridge --

269
0:12:06.004,000 --> 0:12:08,000
there's a much deeper answer.

270
0:12:08.35,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so there's all the fun and the curiosity

271
0:12:10.538,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that you could have playing with toys.

272
0:12:12.524,000 --> 0:12:15,000
By the way -- why should kids have all the fun, right?

273
0:12:16.096,000 --> 0:12:18,000
All of us can have fun playing with toys,

274
0:12:18.12,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.

275
0:12:20.144,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You can blame me, it's fine.

276
0:12:22.046,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So when it comes to reasons for studying physics, for example,

277
0:12:27.479,000 --> 0:12:29,000
here is the best reason I can think of:

278
0:12:30.394,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I think that each of us has three life-support systems.

279
0:12:34.25,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We've got our own body, we've got a planet

280
0:12:36.631,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and we've got our civilization.

281
0:12:38.422,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Each of those is an independent life-support system,

282
0:12:41.485,000 --> 0:12:43,000
keeping us alive in its own way.

283
0:12:43.509,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And they all run on the fundamental physical laws

284
0:12:46.7,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and teacups and lemonade,

285
0:12:50.124,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and everything else you can play with.

286
0:12:52.027,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is the reason, for example,

287
0:12:53.652,000 --> 0:12:55,000
why something like climate change is such a serious problem,

288
0:12:56.581,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because It's two of these life-support systems,

289
0:12:59.137,000 --> 0:13:,000
our planet and our civilization,

290
0:13:00.929,000 --> 0:13:01,000
kind of butting up against each other;

291
0:13:02.908,000 --> 0:13:04,000
they're in conflict, and we need to negotiate that boundary.

292
0:13:05.824,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And the fundamental physical laws that we can learn

293
0:13:08.364,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that are the way the world around us works,

294
0:13:10.568,000 --> 0:13:12,000
are the tools at the basis of everything;

295
0:13:13.012,000 --> 0:13:14,000
they're the foundation.

296
0:13:14.398,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There's lots of things to know about in life,

297
0:13:16.593,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but knowing the foundations is going to get you a long way.

298
0:13:19.413,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And I think this, if you're not interested in having fun with physics

299
0:13:23.078,000 --> 0:13:27,000
or anything like that -- strange, but apparently, these people exist --

300
0:13:27.153,000 --> 0:13:31,000
you surely are interested in keeping yourself alive

301
0:13:31.264,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and in how our life-support systems work.

302
0:13:33.339,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The framework for physics is remarkably constant;

303
0:13:38.138,000 --> 0:13:4,000
it's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure.

304
0:13:40.838,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's not going to change anytime soon.

305
0:13:42.7,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They might discover some new quantum mechanics,

306
0:13:44.987,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but apples right here are still going to fall down.

307
0:13:47.667,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So, the question is --

308
0:13:49.814,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I get asked sometimes: How do you start?

309
0:13:52.127,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What's the place to start

310
0:13:53.372,000 --> 0:13:56,000
if you're interested in the physical world, in not being helpless,

311
0:13:56.652,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and in finding some toys to play with?

312
0:13:58.513,000 --> 0:14:,000
Here is my suggestion to you:

313
0:14:00.941,000 --> 0:14:05,000
the place to start is that moment -- and adults do this --

314
0:14:06.364,000 --> 0:14:07,000
you're drifting along somewhere,

315
0:14:08.25,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and you spot something and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."

316
0:14:11.865,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And then your consciousness goes, "You're an adult. Keep going."

317
0:14:15.513,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And that's the point -- hold that thought --

318
0:14:18.376,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that bit where your brain went, "Oh, that's a bit odd,"

319
0:14:21.028,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because there's something there to play with,

320
0:14:23.105,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and it's worth you playing with it,

321
0:14:24.847,000 --> 0:14:25,000
so that's the place to start.

322
0:14:26.267,000 --> 0:14:28,000
But if you don't have any of those little moments

323
0:14:28.657,000 --> 0:14:29,000
on your way home from this event,

324
0:14:30.277,000 --> 0:14:31,000
here are some things to start with.

325
0:14:31.986,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; highly entertaining.

326
0:14:34.172,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Watch a coffee spill dry.

327
0:14:36.196,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I know that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry,

328
0:14:38.824,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but it does do quite weird things; it's worth watching.

329
0:14:42.313,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around.

330
0:14:46.532,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There are so many things you can do to play with teacups, it's brilliant.

331
0:14:49.996,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The most obvious one is to get a teacup, get a spoon,

332
0:14:53.429,000 --> 0:14:55,000
tap the teacup around the rim and listen,

333
0:14:55.771,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and you will hear something strange.

334
0:14:57.59,000 --> 0:15:,000
And the other thing is, push your toast off the table

335
0:15:00.914,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because you can, and you'll learn stuff from it.

336
0:15:03.347,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And if you're feeling really ambitious,

337
0:15:05.323,000 --> 0:15:09,000
try and push it off in such a way that it doesn't fall butter-side down,

338
0:15:09.474,000 --> 0:15:1,000
which is possible.

339
0:15:11.054,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The point of all of this is that,

340
0:15:13.78,000 --> 0:15:15,000
first of all, we should all play with toys.

341
0:15:15.897,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves

342
0:15:19.345,000 --> 0:15:2,000
with the tools around us,

343
0:15:20.619,000 --> 0:15:21,000
because we all have access to them.

344
0:15:22.423,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It matters, because if we want to understand society,

345
0:15:25.066,000 --> 0:15:26,000
if we want to be good citizens,

346
0:15:26.649,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based.

347
0:15:31.267,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Playing with toys is great.

348
0:15:32.794,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Understanding how to keep our life-support systems going is great.

349
0:15:35.931,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But fundamentally, the thing that we need to change

350
0:15:38.348,000 --> 0:15:39,000
in the way that we talk about physics,

351
0:15:40.2,000 --> 0:15:41,000
is we need to understand

352
0:15:41.383,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that physics isn't out there with weird people

353
0:15:43.723,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and strange hieroglyphics

354
0:15:45.227,000 --> 0:15:46,000
for somebody else in a posh lab.

355
0:15:46.873,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Physics is right here; it's for us, and we can all play with it.

356
0:15:49.947,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Thank you very much.

357
0:15:51.137,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

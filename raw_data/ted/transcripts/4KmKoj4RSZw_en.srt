1
0:00:15.36,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the will to live life differently can

2
0:00:18.43,000 --> 0:00:23,000
start in some of the most unusual places

3
0:00:21.36,000 --> 0:00:25,000
this is where I come from Tamil and it's

4
0:00:24.4,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a market tone in the north of England

5
0:00:26.099,000 --> 0:00:3,000
15,000 people between Leeds and

6
0:00:28.42,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Manchester fairly normal market tone

7
0:00:30.66,000 --> 0:00:37,000
used to look like this and now it's more

8
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:4,000
like this with fruit and veg and herb

9
0:00:37.87,000 --> 0:00:44,000
sprouting up all over the place we call

10
0:00:40.21,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it propaganda gardening corner of our

11
0:00:45.25,000 --> 0:00:5,000
railway station car park front of our

12
0:00:47.769,000 --> 0:00:53,000
health centre people's front gardens and

13
0:00:50.909,000 --> 0:00:56,000
even in front of the police station

14
0:00:54.479,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we've got two edible Canal towpath

15
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and we've got sprouting cemeteries the

16
0:00:59.799,000 --> 0:01:02,000
soil is extremely good

17
0:01:06.21,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we've even invented a new form of

18
0:01:08.439,000 --> 0:01:12,000
tourism it's called vegetable tourism

19
0:01:10.21,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and believe it or not people come from

20
0:01:12.759,000 --> 0:01:17,000
all over the world to poke around in our

21
0:01:15.46,000 --> 0:01:21,000
raised beds even when there's not much

22
0:01:17.77,000 --> 0:01:23,000
growing but it starts a conversation and

23
0:01:22.05,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you know we're not doing it because

24
0:01:24.1,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we're bored we're doing it because we

25
0:01:28.51,000 --> 0:01:33,000
want to start a revolution we try to

26
0:01:31.81,000 --> 0:01:35,000
answer this simple question can you find

27
0:01:33.73,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a unifying language that cuts across age

28
0:01:35.95,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and income and culture that will help

29
0:01:38.83,000 --> 0:01:4,000
people themselves find a new way of

30
0:01:40.99,000 --> 0:01:43,000
living

31
0:01:41.38,000 --> 0:01:44,000
see spaces around them differently think

32
0:01:44.11,000 --> 0:01:48,000
about the resource there used

33
0:01:45.25,000 --> 0:01:51,000
differently interact differently can we

34
0:01:48.97,000 --> 0:01:54,000
find that language and then can we

35
0:01:51.909,000 --> 0:01:57,000
replicate those actions and the answer

36
0:01:55.78,000 --> 0:02:,000
would appear to be yes and the language

37
0:01:58.18,000 --> 0:02:03,000
would appear to be food so three and a

38
0:02:01.75,000 --> 0:02:04,000
half years ago a few of us a trendy

39
0:02:03.43,000 --> 0:02:07,000
kitchen table and we just invented the

40
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
whole thing

41
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we came up with a really simple game

42
0:02:12.54,000 --> 0:02:15,000
plan that we put to a public meeting we

43
0:02:14.04,000 --> 0:02:19,000
did not consult we did not write a

44
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:2,000
report enough of all that and we said to

45
0:02:19.41,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that public meeting in Todmorden

46
0:02:21.3,000 --> 0:02:26,000
look let's imagine that our tone is

47
0:02:24.42,000 --> 0:02:27,000
focused around three plates a community

48
0:02:26.73,000 --> 0:02:29,000
plate the way we live our everyday lives

49
0:02:28.29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a Learning plate what we learn what we

50
0:02:30.69,000 --> 0:02:33,000
teach our kids in school and what we

51
0:02:32.07,000 --> 0:02:35,000
want new skills we share amongst

52
0:02:33.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
ourselves and business what what we do

53
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with the pound in our pocket and which

54
0:02:37.77,000 --> 0:02:41,000
businesses we choose to support now

55
0:02:39.66,000 --> 0:02:44,000
let's imagine those plates agitated with

56
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:46,000
community actions around food if we

57
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
start one of those community plates

58
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:5,000
spinning that's really great that really

59
0:02:48.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
starts to empower people but if we can

60
0:02:50.76,000 --> 0:02:53,000
then spin that community plate with a

61
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
learning plate and then spin it with a

62
0:02:54.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
business plate we've got a real show

63
0:02:56.34,000 --> 0:03:,000
though we've got some action theater

64
0:02:58.28,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we're starting to build resilience

65
0:03:01.11,000 --> 0:03:06,000
ourselves we're starting to reinvent

66
0:03:03.63,000 --> 0:03:1,000
community ourselves and we've done it

67
0:03:06.39,000 --> 0:03:1,000
all without a flipping strategy document

68
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and here's the thing as well we've not

69
0:03:17.75,000 --> 0:03:22,000
asked anybody's permission to do this

70
0:03:19.73,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we're just doing it and we are certainly

71
0:03:23.03,000 --> 0:03:25,000
not waiting for that cheque to drop

72
0:03:24.41,000 --> 0:03:27,000
through the letterbox with all we start

73
0:03:25.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and most importantly of all we are not

74
0:03:28.25,000 --> 0:03:32,000
daunted by the sophisticated arguments

75
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that say these small actions are

76
0:03:32.599,000 --> 0:03:36,000
meaningless in the face of tomorrow's

77
0:03:34.22,000 --> 0:03:4,000
problems because I have seen the power

78
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of small actions and it is awesome so

79
0:03:40.4,000 --> 0:03:46,000
back to the public meeting we put that

80
0:03:43.97,000 --> 0:03:48,000
proposition to the meeting two seconds

81
0:03:46.549,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then the room exploded I have never

82
0:03:49.01,000 --> 0:03:53,000
ever experienced anything like that in

83
0:03:50.81,000 --> 0:03:54,000
my life and it's been the same in every

84
0:03:53.54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
single room in every town that we've

85
0:03:55.64,000 --> 0:04:01,000
ever told our story people are ready and

86
0:03:58.76,000 --> 0:04:02,000
respond to the story of foods they want

87
0:04:01.64,000 --> 0:04:05,000
positive actions they can engage in and

88
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in their bones they know it's time to

89
0:04:06.11,000 --> 0:04:11,000
take personal responsibility and invest

90
0:04:08.569,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in more kindness to each other and to

91
0:04:11.39,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the environment and since we had that

92
0:04:14.349,000 --> 0:04:19,000
meeting three and a half years ago it's

93
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
been a heck of a roller coaster we

94
0:04:20.209,000 --> 0:04:24,000
started with a seed swap really simple

95
0:04:22.43,000 --> 0:04:26,000
stuff and then we took an area of land a

96
0:04:24.59,000 --> 0:04:27,000
strip on the side of our main road which

97
0:04:26.51,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was a dog toilet basically and we turned

98
0:04:28.43,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it into a really lovely herb garden we

99
0:04:31.1,000 --> 0:04:34,000
took the corner of the car park in the

100
0:04:32.81,000 --> 0:04:35,000
station that you saw and we made

101
0:04:34.37,000 --> 0:04:38,000
vegetable beds for everybody to share

102
0:04:36.11,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and pick from themselves we went to the

103
0:04:39.229,000 --> 0:04:42,000
doctors we've just at a six million

104
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:44,000
pound Health Center built in Todmorden

105
0:04:42.5,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and for some reason that I cannot

106
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
comprehend it has been surrounded by

107
0:04:46.82,000 --> 0:04:5,000
prickly plants

108
0:04:49.03,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so we went to the doctor said would you

109
0:04:51.55,000 --> 0:04:53,000
mind is taking a mock they said

110
0:04:52.78,000 --> 0:04:55,000
absolutely fine provide you get planning

111
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
permission and you do it in Latin you do

112
0:04:55.78,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it in triplicate so we did and now there

113
0:04:58.78,000 --> 0:05:03,000
are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and

114
0:05:02.08,000 --> 0:05:07,000
vegetables around that doctor's surgery

115
0:05:04.45,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and there's been lots of other examples

116
0:05:07.66,000 --> 0:05:1,000
like the corn that was in front of the

117
0:05:08.98,000 --> 0:05:11,000
police station and the old people's home

118
0:05:10.87,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that we've planted up with food that

119
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they can pick and grow but it isn't just

120
0:05:14.47,000 --> 0:05:18,000
about growing because we all a part of

121
0:05:16.66,000 --> 0:05:2,000
this jigsaw it's about taking those

122
0:05:19.39,000 --> 0:05:22,000
artistic people in your community and

123
0:05:21.01,000 --> 0:05:24,000
doing some fabulous designs in those

124
0:05:22.57,000 --> 0:05:25,000
raised beds to explain to people what's

125
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
growing there because there's so many

126
0:05:26.05,000 --> 0:05:29,000
people that don't really recognize a

127
0:05:27.73,000 --> 0:05:29,000
vegetable unless it's in a bit of

128
0:05:29.2,000 --> 0:05:32,000
plastic with a bit of an instruction

129
0:05:30.4,000 --> 0:05:34,000
packet on the top so we have some people

130
0:05:33.13,000 --> 0:05:35,000
who design these things it looks like

131
0:05:34.69,000 --> 0:05:36,000
this please don't pick it but it looks

132
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like this help yourself

133
0:05:37.63,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this is about sharing and investing in

134
0:05:39.82,000 --> 0:05:42,000
kindness and for those people that don't

135
0:05:42.34,000 --> 0:05:45,000
want to do either of those things maybe

136
0:05:43.78,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they can cook so we pick them seasonally

137
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then we go on the street or in the

138
0:05:48.669,000 --> 0:05:51,000
pub or in the church or wherever people

139
0:05:50.919,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are living their lives this is about us

140
0:05:52.54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
going to the people in saying we are all

141
0:05:55.18,000 --> 0:06:,000
part of the local food jigsaw we are all

142
0:05:57.25,000 --> 0:06:01,000
part of a solution and then because we

143
0:06:00.49,000 --> 0:06:02,000
know we've got vegetable tourists and we

144
0:06:01.78,000 --> 0:06:04,000
love them to bits and they're absolutely

145
0:06:03.25,000 --> 0:06:06,000
fantastic we thought what can we do to

146
0:06:05.41,000 --> 0:06:09,000
give them an even better experience so

147
0:06:07.15,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we invented without asking of course the

148
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:13,000
incredible edible green route and this

149
0:06:11.65,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is the route of exhibition gardens and

150
0:06:14.04,000 --> 0:06:2,000
edible tour paths and be friendly sites

151
0:06:18.07,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the story of pollinators and it's a

152
0:06:20.77,000 --> 0:06:23,000
route that we designed that takes people

153
0:06:22.51,000 --> 0:06:26,000
through the whole of our town past our

154
0:06:24.729,000 --> 0:06:29,000
cafes and our small shops through our

155
0:06:26.77,000 --> 0:06:31,000
market not just to and fro from the

156
0:06:30.22,000 --> 0:06:33,000
supermarket and we're hoping that in

157
0:06:31.81,000 --> 0:06:35,000
changing people's footfall around our

158
0:06:33.64,000 --> 0:06:37,000
town we're also changing their behavior

159
0:06:35.979,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and then there's a second plate the

160
0:06:38.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
learning plate well we're in partnership

161
0:06:40.96,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with the high school we've created a

162
0:06:42.1,000 --> 0:06:46,000
company we are designing and building an

163
0:06:44.83,000 --> 0:06:46,000
aquaponics unit in some land that we

164
0:06:46.39,000 --> 0:06:48,000
spare at the back of the high school

165
0:06:47.47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
like you do and now we're going to be

166
0:06:49.3,000 --> 0:06:53,000
growing fish and vegetables in an

167
0:06:51.07,000 --> 0:06:56,000
orchard with bees and the kids are

168
0:06:54.07,000 --> 0:06:58,000
helping us build that and the kids are

169
0:06:56.08,000 --> 0:06:59,000
on the board and because the community

170
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:07:,000
was really keen on working with the high

171
0:06:59.59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
school the high school is now teaching

172
0:07:01.14,000 --> 0:07:05,000
agriculture

173
0:07:02.92,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and because it's teaching agriculture we

174
0:07:05.77,000 --> 0:07:08,000
started to think how can we then get

175
0:07:07.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
those kids that never had a

176
0:07:08.83,000 --> 0:07:1,000
qualification before in their lives but

177
0:07:10.24,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they're really excited about growing how

178
0:07:11.77,000 --> 0:07:14,000
can we give them some more experience so

179
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we got some land that was donated by a

180
0:07:15.64,000 --> 0:07:18,000
local garden center it was really quite

181
0:07:17.53,000 --> 0:07:22,000
muddy but in truly incredible way

182
0:07:19.63,000 --> 0:07:23,000
totally voluntary led we have turned

183
0:07:22.57,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that into a Market Garden training

184
0:07:23.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
center and that is Polly tunnels and

185
0:07:26.77,000 --> 0:07:29,000
raised beds and all the things you need

186
0:07:28.45,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to get the soil under your fingers and

187
0:07:30.37,000 --> 0:07:33,000
think maybe the job in this for me in

188
0:07:31.6,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the future and because we were doing

189
0:07:33.58,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that some local academics said you know

190
0:07:35.23,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we could help design a commercial

191
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:39,000
horticulture course for you is there's

192
0:07:38.29,000 --> 0:07:4,000
not one that we know of so they're doing

193
0:07:39.76,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that and we're going to launch it later

194
0:07:40.9,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this year and it's all an experiment and

195
0:07:43.66,000 --> 0:07:46,000
it's all voluntary and then there's the

196
0:07:45.07,000 --> 0:07:48,000
third plate because if you walk through

197
0:07:47.17,000 --> 0:07:5,000
an edible landscape and if you learning

198
0:07:48.85,000 --> 0:07:51,000
new skills and if you start to get

199
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
interested in what's growing seasonally

200
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you might just want to spend more of

201
0:07:53.71,000 --> 0:07:57,000
your own money in support of local

202
0:07:55.39,000 --> 0:07:58,000
producers not just veg but meat and

203
0:07:57.85,000 --> 0:08:01,000
cheese and beer and whatever else it

204
0:07:59.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
might be but then we're just a community

205
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
group you know we'll just throw

206
0:08:03.61,000 --> 0:08:06,000
volunteers what could we actually do so

207
0:08:05.32,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we did some really simple things we

208
0:08:07.03,000 --> 0:08:09,000
fundraise we got some black boards we

209
0:08:08.53,000 --> 0:08:1,000
put incredible edible on the top we gave

210
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
it to every market trader that was

211
0:08:11.29,000 --> 0:08:14,000
selling locally and it scribbled on what

212
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they were selling in any wrong one week

213
0:08:15.01,000 --> 0:08:21,000
really popular people congregated around

214
0:08:17.11,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it sales were up and then we had to chat

215
0:08:21.25,000 --> 0:08:23,000
with the farmers and we said we're

216
0:08:22.27,000 --> 0:08:25,000
really serious about this but they

217
0:08:23.41,000 --> 0:08:27,000
didn't actually believe us so we thought

218
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
okay what should we do I know if we can

219
0:08:28.18,000 --> 0:08:31,000
create a campaign around round one

220
0:08:29.98,000 --> 0:08:32,000
product and show them there is local

221
0:08:31.54,000 --> 0:08:34,000
loyalty to that product maybe they'll

222
0:08:33.25,000 --> 0:08:36,000
change their mind and see we're serious

223
0:08:34.93,000 --> 0:08:38,000
so we launched a campaign because it

224
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:43,000
just amusingly called every egg matters

225
0:08:39.28,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and what we did was we put people on our

226
0:08:43.63,000 --> 0:08:47,000
egg map it's a stylized map of Todmorden

227
0:08:45.45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
anybody that's selling their excess eggs

228
0:08:47.77,000 --> 0:08:5,000
at the garden-gate purple illegally to

229
0:08:49.63,000 --> 0:08:52,000
their neighbors we've stuck on there we

230
0:08:50.86,000 --> 0:08:53,000
started with four and we've now got 64

231
0:08:53.47,000 --> 0:08:56,000
on and the result of that was that

232
0:08:54.85,000 --> 0:08:57,000
people were then going into shops ask

233
0:08:56.68,000 --> 0:08:59,000
him for a local table and an egg and the

234
0:08:58.54,000 --> 0:09:01,000
result of that was some farmers up the

235
0:09:00.34,000 --> 0:09:03,000
amount of flock they got free rent Birds

236
0:09:01.96,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then they went on to meet birds and

237
0:09:03.61,000 --> 0:09:07,000
although these are really really small

238
0:09:05.2,000 --> 0:09:11,000
steps that that increasing local

239
0:09:08.53,000 --> 0:09:12,000
economic confidence is starting to play

240
0:09:12.01,000 --> 0:09:14,000
out in a number of ways so we know how

241
0:09:13.36,000 --> 0:09:16,000
farmers doing cheese and live up the

242
0:09:14.83,000 --> 0:09:17,000
flocks a rare breed pigs

243
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:19,000
pasties and pies and things that they

244
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
would have never have done before we've

245
0:09:20.139,000 --> 0:09:23,000
got increasing market stall selling

246
0:09:21.639,000 --> 0:09:26,000
local food and in a survey that local

247
0:09:24.1,000 --> 0:09:29,000
students did follows 49 percent of all

248
0:09:27.55,000 --> 0:09:3,000
food traders in that tone said that

249
0:09:29.35,000 --> 0:09:32,000
their bottom landed increase because of

250
0:09:30.759,000 --> 0:09:33,000
what we were actually doing and we're

251
0:09:32.92,000 --> 0:09:37,000
just volunteers and it's only an

252
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:4,000
experiment now none of this is rocket

253
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
science it certainly is not clever and

254
0:09:40.75,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's not original but it is joined up

255
0:09:43.54,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it is inclusive this is not a

256
0:09:46.87,000 --> 0:09:49,000
movement for those people that are going

257
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to sort and selves out anyway this is a

258
0:09:50.649,000 --> 0:09:56,000
movement for everyone we have a motto if

259
0:09:53.62,000 --> 0:09:56,000
you eat you're in

260
0:10:02.55,000 --> 0:10:07,000
across age across income across culture

261
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it's been really quite a roller coaster

262
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:14,000
experience but going back to that first

263
0:10:12.42,000 --> 0:10:16,000
question that we asked is it replicable

264
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:19,000
yeah it most certainly is replicable

265
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:22,000
more than 30 Jones in England no I spin

266
0:10:19.92,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in the incredible edible plates

267
0:10:22.04,000 --> 0:10:26,000
whichever way they want to do it they're

268
0:10:24.18,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of their own volition they're trying to

269
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
make their own lives differently and

270
0:10:28.41,000 --> 0:10:32,000
worldwide we've got communities across

271
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:34,000
America and debates incredible isn't it

272
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I mean I'm working America and Japan and

273
0:10:34.65,000 --> 0:10:38,000
New Zealand people after the earthquake

274
0:10:36.48,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in New Zealand visited us in order to

275
0:10:38.82,000 --> 0:10:41,000
incorporate some of this public

276
0:10:40.41,000 --> 0:10:46,000
spiritedness around local growing into

277
0:10:42.51,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the heart of Christchurch and none of

278
0:10:46.68,000 --> 0:10:52,000
this takes more money and none of this

279
0:10:49.65,000 --> 0:10:54,000
demands a bureaucracy but it does demand

280
0:10:53.01,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that you think things differently and

281
0:10:54.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you are prepared to bend budgets and

282
0:10:56.58,000 --> 0:11:,000
work programs in order to create that

283
0:10:59.19,000 --> 0:11:03,000
supportive framework that compute

284
0:11:01.02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
communities can bounce off and there's

285
0:11:03.45,000 --> 0:11:07,000
some great ideas already in our patch a

286
0:11:05.64,000 --> 0:11:09,000
local authority has decided to make

287
0:11:07.89,000 --> 0:11:11,000
everywhere incredible edible and in

288
0:11:10.59,000 --> 0:11:13,000
support of that have decided to do two

289
0:11:12.42,000 --> 0:11:15,000
things first they're going to create an

290
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:17,000
asset register of spare land that

291
0:11:15.87,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they've got put it in a food bank so

292
0:11:17.85,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that communities can use that wherever

293
0:11:19.23,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they live and they're going to underpin

294
0:11:20.7,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that with a license and then they said

295
0:11:22.5,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to every single one of their workforce

296
0:11:24.39,000 --> 0:11:28,000
if you can help those communities grow

297
0:11:26.64,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and help them maintain their spaces

298
0:11:28.52,000 --> 0:11:31,000
suddenly we're seeing actions on the

299
0:11:30.51,000 --> 0:11:33,000
ground from local government we're

300
0:11:32.01,000 --> 0:11:36,000
seeing this mainstreamed we are

301
0:11:33.78,000 --> 0:11:38,000
responding creatively at last to what

302
0:11:36.42,000 --> 0:11:4,000
real demanded of us and there's lots

303
0:11:38.94,000 --> 0:11:42,000
more you could do I mean just to list a

304
0:11:41.34,000 --> 0:11:44,000
few one please stop putting prickly

305
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
plants around public buildings it's a

306
0:11:44.67,000 --> 0:11:49,000
waste of space secondly please create

307
0:11:47.15,000 --> 0:11:51,000
please please create edible landscapes

308
0:11:49.83,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so that our children start to walk past

309
0:11:52.02,000 --> 0:11:56,000
their food day in day out on our high

310
0:11:53.61,000 --> 0:11:55,000
streets in our parks wherever that might

311
0:11:56.1,000 --> 0:11:59,000
be

312
0:11:56.37,000 --> 0:12:01,000
inspire local planners to put the food

313
0:11:59.43,000 --> 0:12:04,000
sights at the heart of the tone and the

314
0:12:01.71,000 --> 0:12:05,000
city plan not relegate them to the edges

315
0:12:04.47,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of the settlements that nobody can see I

316
0:12:06.5,000 --> 0:12:1,000
encourage all our schools to take this

317
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:13,000
seriously this isn't a second class

318
0:12:10.77,000 --> 0:12:15,000
exercise if we want to inspire the

319
0:12:13.86,000 --> 0:12:15,000
farmers of tomorrow then please let us

320
0:12:15.96,000 --> 0:12:19,000
say

321
0:12:16.36,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to every school create a sense of

322
0:12:20.199,000 --> 0:12:24,000
purpose around the importance of the

323
0:12:22.089,000 --> 0:12:26,000
environment local food and soils put

324
0:12:24.939,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that at the heart of your school culture

325
0:12:26.739,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and you will create a different

326
0:12:28.089,000 --> 0:12:32,000
generation there are so many things you

327
0:12:30.91,000 --> 0:12:34,000
can do but ultimately this is about

328
0:12:32.829,000 --> 0:12:38,000
something really simple through an

329
0:12:35.41,000 --> 0:12:4,000
organic process through an increasing

330
0:12:38.98,000 --> 0:12:43,000
recognition of the power of small

331
0:12:41.29,000 --> 0:12:46,000
actions we are starting at last to

332
0:12:44.259,000 --> 0:12:48,000
believe in ourselves again and to

333
0:12:46.6,000 --> 0:12:52,000
believe in our capacity each and every

334
0:12:49.179,000 --> 0:12:55,000
one of us to build a different and a

335
0:12:53.049,000 --> 0:12:58,000
kinder future and in my book that's

336
0:12:55.449,000 --> 0:12:57,000
incredible

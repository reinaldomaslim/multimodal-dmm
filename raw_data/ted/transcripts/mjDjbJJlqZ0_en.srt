1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Climate change is already a heavy topic,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and it's getting heavier

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because we're understanding

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that we need to do more than we are.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We're understanding, in fact,

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that those of us who live in the developed world

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when we look at what is there in reality today

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the magnitude of the problem that we face.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we tend to seek simple answers.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We look at where the emissions are coming from --

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we say, okay, well the problem is

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so therefore, the answer must be

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And while, of course, we do need clean energy,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I would put to you that it's possible

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that by looking at climate change

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
as a clean energy generation problem,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we're in fact setting ourselves up

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
not to solve it.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the reason why

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is that we live on a planet

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that is rapidly urbanizing.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That shouldn't be news to any of us.

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
However, it's hard sometimes

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to remember the extent of that urbanization.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
By mid-century,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
living in cities or within a day's travel of one.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In order to provide

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the kind of energy that it would take

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for eight billion people living in cities

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that are even somewhat like the cities

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that those of us in the global North live in today,

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we would have to generate

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It may be possible

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that we are not even able

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to build that much clean energy.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
on an urbanizing planet,

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we need to look somewhere else for the solution.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because all of those cities we're building

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are opportunities.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Every city determines to a very large extent

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I choose to turn this light switch on --

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but really, enormous amounts of our energy use

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are predestined

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I won't show you very many graphs today,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is, quite simply,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that if you look, for example, at transportation,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a major category of climate emissions,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
there is a direct relationship

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
between how dense a city is

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the amount of climate emissions

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that its residents spew out into the air.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the correlation, of course,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Basically,

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we substitute, in our lives,

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
access to the things we want.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We go out there and we hop in our cars

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we drive from place to place.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But when we live in a denser community,

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
suddenly what we find, of course,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is that the things we need are close by.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And since the most sustainable trip

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is the one that you never had to make in the first place,

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And it is possible, of course,

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to increase the density of the communities around us.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Some places are doing this with new eco districts,

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which is nice work if you can get it,

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So we're talking about things like infill development:

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
really sharp little changes

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to where we have buildings, where we're developing.

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Urban retrofitting:

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
creating different sorts of spaces and uses

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
out of places that are already there.

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Increasingly, we're realizing

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that we don't even need to densify an entire city.

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What we need instead is an average density

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that rises to a level

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where we don't drive as much and so on.

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And that can be done

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So you can think of it as tent poles

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that actually raise the density of the entire city.

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we find that when we do that,

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense

109
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
within a wider fabric of places

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that are perhaps a little more comfortable

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and achieve the same results.

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and still hold onto their cars,

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but the reality is that, by and large,

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is a threshold effect,

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where people simply stop driving as much,

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and increasingly, more and more people,

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
give up their cars altogether.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And this is a huge, huge energy savings,

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because what comes out of our tailpipe

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is really just the beginning of the story

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with climate emissions from cars.

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
all of the parking and freeways and so on.

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When you can get rid of all of those

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because somebody doesn't use any of them really,

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as much as 90 percent.

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And people are embracing this.

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.

133
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to the dream neighborhood.

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And when you layer that over

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
what you find is, in fact,

138
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
even more access suffused into spaces.

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Some of it's transportation access.

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
using public transportation.

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is Google Walking Maps.

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it told me to go via Guernsey.

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It did tell me that this route

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But the technologies are getting better,

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And as we just heard earlier,

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.

154
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all,

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we're learning how to include

156
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in these systems of notation and navigation.

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Part of what we're finding with this

158
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is that what we thought

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
was the major point

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of manufacturing and consumption,

161
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which is to get a bunch of stuff,

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is not, in fact,

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
how we really live best in dense environments.

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
What we're finding is that what we want

165
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is access to the capacities of things.

166
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?

167
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Okay. I do too.

168
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes

169
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in its entire lifetime,

170
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
depending on who you ask.

171
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And so what we do is we buy these drills

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,

173
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.

174
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Our cities, I would put to you,

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And while we could try and figure out

177
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
new ways to use those capacities --

178
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
such as cooking or making ice sculptures

179
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
or even a mafia hit --

180
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
what we probably will find

181
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is that, in fact, turning those products into services

182
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that we have access to when we want them,

183
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is a far smarter way to go.

184
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.

185
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We're finding that people can share the same spaces,

186
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
do stuff with vacant space.

187
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Buildings are becoming bundles of services.

188
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So we have new designs

189
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --

190
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
like heating, cooling etc. --

191
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.

192
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So we light our buildings with daylight.

193
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.

194
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In fact, when we use all these things,

195
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
what we've found is that, in some cases,

196
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.

197
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Which brings on another threshold effect

198
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I like to call furnace dumping,

199
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which is, quite simply,

200
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,

201
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you save a whole bunch of money up front.

202
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
These things actually become cheaper to build

203
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
than the alternatives.

204
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now when we look at being able

205
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to slash our product use, slash our transportation use,

206
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
slash our building energy use,

207
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.

208
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,

209
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we need to think a little differently.

210
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is one way to do it.

211
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.

212
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart

213
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.

214
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So we have visions like this.

215
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.

216
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now all of these are fine projects,

217
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but they really have missed an essential point,

218
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which is it's not about the leaves above,

219
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it's about the systems below.

220
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater

221
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so that we can reduce water use?

222
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Water is energy intensive.

223
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,

224
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so that we can take runoff

225
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and water that's going out of our houses

226
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and clean it and filter it

227
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and grow urban street trees?

228
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us

229
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
by, for example, connecting us to rivers

230
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and allowing for restoration?

231
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Do they allow for pollination,

232
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
pollinator pathways

233
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?

234
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Do they even take the very waste matter

235
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that we have from food and fiber and so forth,

236
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and turn it back into soil

237
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and sequester carbon --

238
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
take carbon out of the air

239
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the process of using our cities?

240
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,

241
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they're being done right now,

242
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and that it's a darn good thing.

243
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Because right now, our economy by and large

244
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
operates as Paul Hawken said,

245
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"by stealing the future, selling it in the present

246
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and calling it GDP."

247
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And if we have another eight billion

248
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
or seven billion,

249
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or six billion, even, people,

250
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,

251
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we're going to run out of future really fast.

252
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But if we think differently,

253
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I think that, in fact, we can have cities

254
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
that are not only zero emissions,

255
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but have unlimited possibilities as well.

256
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Thank you very much.

257
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

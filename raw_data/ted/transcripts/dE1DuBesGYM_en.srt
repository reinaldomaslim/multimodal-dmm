1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

2
0:00:17.506,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've been making games online now for 10 years,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and my goal for the next decade

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life

5
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as it is to save the world in online games.

6
0:00:31.886,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, I have a plan for this,

7
0:00:33.901,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and it entails convincing more people,

8
0:00:36.838,000 --> 0:00:4,000
including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.

9
0:00:41.719,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.

10
0:00:46.617,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Some of you might be thinking,

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"That's a lot of time to spend playing games.

12
0:00:50.427,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Maybe too much time,

13
0:00:51.753,000 --> 0:00:54,000
considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future,

15
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
actually the opposite is true.

16
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play

17
0:01:05.609,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to solve the world's most urgent problems.

18
0:01:08.031,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive

19
0:01:10.674,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the next century on this planet,

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we need to increase that total dramatically.

21
0:01:14.807,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I've calculated the total we need

22
0:01:16.809,000 --> 0:01:19,000
at 21 billion hours of game play every week.

23
0:01:20.807,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, that's probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea,

24
0:01:23.473,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so I'll say it again, let it sink in:

25
0:01:26.038,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If we want to solve problems like hunger,

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,

27
0:01:31.53,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I believe that we need to aspire to play games online

28
0:01:35.57,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade.

29
0:01:39.166,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:40.198,000 --> 0:01:42,000
No. I'm serious. I am.

31
0:01:42.34,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Here's why.

32
0:01:43.515,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential

33
0:01:46.782,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to the future survival of the human species.

34
0:01:48.945,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:49.973,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Truly.

36
0:01:51.148,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.

37
0:01:53.789,000 --> 0:01:55,000
He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,

38
0:01:56.053,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.

39
0:01:59.187,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this is a classic gaming emotion.

40
0:02:02.136,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, if you're not a gamer,

41
0:02:04.065,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you might miss some of the nuance in this photo.

42
0:02:06.486,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You probably see the sense of urgency,

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a little bit of fear, but intense concentration,

44
0:02:12.668,000 --> 0:02:15,000
deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here:

46
0:02:20.021,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth

47
0:02:22.834,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is a sign of optimism,

48
0:02:24.453,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the eyebrows up is surprise.

49
0:02:26.912,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an "epic win."

50
0:02:31.063,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Oh, you've heard of that.

52
0:02:33.69,000 --> 0:02:35,000
OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.

53
0:02:36.246,000 --> 0:02:4,000
An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive,

54
0:02:40.516,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.

55
0:02:43.556,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there,

56
0:02:47.839,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of.

57
0:02:50.522,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That's an epic win.

58
0:02:51.704,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.

59
0:02:54.112,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And this is the face that we need to see

60
0:02:56.549,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on millions of problem-solvers all over the world

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century --

62
0:03:02.605,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the face of someone who, against all odds,

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is on the verge of an epic win.

64
0:03:07.181,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see

65
0:03:10.521,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.

66
0:03:13.316,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

67
0:03:15.839,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is actually me making it.

68
0:03:17.363,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Can you see? Yes. Good.

69
0:03:18.64,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood

71
0:03:23.665,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD

72
0:03:25.944,000 --> 0:03:28,000
on why we're better in games than we are in real life.

73
0:03:29.182,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.

74
0:03:31.485,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.

75
0:03:35.786,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.

76
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We do achieve more in game worlds.

77
0:03:41.129,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters --

78
0:03:45.119,000 --> 0:03:47,000
inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.

79
0:03:47.927,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And when we're in game worlds,

80
0:03:49.403,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves --

81
0:03:52.484,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the most likely to help at a moment's notice,

82
0:03:54.626,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes,

83
0:03:57.491,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to get up after failure and try again.

84
0:03:59.601,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And in real life, when we face failure,

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.

86
0:04:06.174,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,

87
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.

88
0:04:12.804,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We never have those feelings when we're playing games,

89
0:04:15.384,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they just don't exist in games.

90
0:04:16.947,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.

91
0:04:20.028,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What about games makes it impossible

92
0:04:22.524,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to feel that we can't achieve everything?

93
0:04:25.001,000 --> 0:04:27,000
How can we take those feelings from games

94
0:04:27.429,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and apply them to real-world work?

95
0:04:29.116,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft,

96
0:04:31.538,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.

97
0:04:34.847,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I started to notice a few things

98
0:04:36.695,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that make epic wins so possible in online worlds.

99
0:04:39.876,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,

100
0:04:43.185,000 --> 0:04:44,000
especially in World of Warcraft,

101
0:04:44.788,000 --> 0:04:46,000
there are lots and lots of different characters

102
0:04:47.106,000 --> 0:04:51,000
who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.

103
0:04:51.384,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But not just any mission,

104
0:04:52.909,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.

105
0:04:56.749,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Right? So you can do it.

106
0:04:58.479,000 --> 0:05:,000
They never give you a challenge you can't achieve.

107
0:05:00.948,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But it is on the verge of what you're capable of,

108
0:05:03.347,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so you have to try hard.

109
0:05:04.615,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,

110
0:05:07.96,000 --> 0:05:08,000
wringing your hands --

111
0:05:09.135,000 --> 0:05:11,000
there's always something specific and important to be done.

112
0:05:11.978,000 --> 0:05:12,000
There are also tons of collaborators.

113
0:05:13.835,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people

114
0:05:16.247,000 --> 0:05:18,000
ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.

115
0:05:19.213,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's not something we have in real life that easily,

116
0:05:21.863,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators.

117
0:05:24.876,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there,

118
0:05:28.391,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and what we're doing,

119
0:05:29.576,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we get all this positive feedback.

120
0:05:31.478,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence.

121
0:05:35.495,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.

122
0:05:38.201,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When I get off this stage,

123
0:05:39.466,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,

124
0:05:44.372,000 --> 0:05:45,000
+20 crazy idea.

125
0:05:46.06,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I don't get that feedback in real life.

126
0:05:48.102,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft

127
0:05:52.974,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,

128
0:05:57.153,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.

129
0:05:59.752,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's just better than reality.

130
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers

131
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
have spent 5.93 million years

132
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

134
0:06:13.777,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It might sound like it's a bad thing.

135
0:06:15.66,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But to put that in context:

136
0:06:17.008,000 --> 0:06:19,000
5.93 million years ago

137
0:06:19.115,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.

138
0:06:23.764,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That was the first upright primate.

139
0:06:26.518,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So when we talk about how much time

140
0:06:29.646,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we're currently investing in playing games,

141
0:06:31.682,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the only way it makes sense to even think about it

142
0:06:34.484,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution,

143
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which is an extraordinary thing.

144
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But it's also apt,

145
0:06:41.792,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games,

146
0:06:44.974,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings.

147
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.

148
0:06:51.923,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is true. I believe this.

149
0:06:53.709,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So, consider this really interesting statistic;

150
0:06:56.574,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:

151
0:07:00.082,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture

152
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games

153
0:07:07.938,000 --> 0:07:08,000
by the age of 21.

154
0:07:09.699,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.

155
0:07:13.68,000 --> 0:07:16,000
First of all, for children in the United States,

156
0:07:17.15,000 --> 0:07:21,000
10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school,

157
0:07:22.158,000 --> 0:07:24,000
from fifth grade to high school graduation,

158
0:07:24.284,000 --> 0:07:25,000
if you have perfect attendance.

159
0:07:25.831,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:26.856,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on,

161
0:07:30.465,000 --> 0:07:33,000
where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer

162
0:07:34.197,000 --> 0:07:36,000
as they're learning about everything else in school.

163
0:07:36.701,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"

164
0:07:40.312,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so you would have heard of his theory of success,

165
0:07:42.678,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the "10,000 hours" theory of success.

166
0:07:44.801,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's based on this great cognitive-science research

167
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that says if we can master 10,000 hours

168
0:07:50.601,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of effortful study at anything by the age of 21,

169
0:07:53.998,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we will be virtuosos at it.

170
0:07:55.521,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We will be as good at whatever we do

171
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
as the greatest people in the world.

172
0:07:59.125,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And so, now what we're looking at

173
0:08:01.907,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers.

174
0:08:07.018,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So, the big question is,

175
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?"

176
0:08:12.601,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because if we could figure that out,

177
0:08:14.41,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands.

178
0:08:18.839,000 --> 0:08:2,000
This is how many people we now have in the world

179
0:08:21.126,000 --> 0:08:23,000
who spend at least an hour a day playing online games.

180
0:08:24.037,000 --> 0:08:26,000
These are our virtuoso gamers,

181
0:08:26.157,000 --> 0:08:29,000
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.

182
0:08:30.918,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And in the next decade,

183
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we're going to have another billion gamers

184
0:08:34.284,000 --> 0:08:36,000
who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.

185
0:08:37.085,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If you don't know it already, this is coming.

186
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The game industry is developing consoles

187
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks

188
0:08:44.638,000 --> 0:08:45,000
instead of broadband Internet,

189
0:08:46.488,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so that gamers all over the world,

190
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.

191
0:08:52.108,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.

192
0:08:54.758,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.

193
0:08:57.217,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So I've started to think about

194
0:08:58.709,000 --> 0:09:,000
what these games are making us virtuosos at.

195
0:09:00.949,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Here are the four things I came up with.

196
0:09:02.924,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The first is urgent optimism.

197
0:09:04.908,000 --> 0:09:06,000
OK, think of this as extreme self-motivation.

198
0:09:08.003,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately

199
0:09:11.075,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to tackle an obstacle,

200
0:09:12.756,000 --> 0:09:15,000
combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.

201
0:09:17.003,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible,

202
0:09:19.713,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and that it's always worth trying, and trying now.

203
0:09:22.442,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Gamers don't sit around.

204
0:09:24.033,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.

205
0:09:28.113,000 --> 0:09:3,000
There's a lot of interesting research that shows

206
0:09:30.394,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we like people better after we play a game with them,

207
0:09:32.974,000 --> 0:09:33,000
even if they've beaten us badly.

208
0:09:34.807,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone.

209
0:09:38.173,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We trust that they will spend their time with us,

210
0:09:40.489,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that they will play by the same rules,

211
0:09:42.355,000 --> 0:09:45,000
value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.

212
0:09:45.711,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And so, playing a game together

213
0:09:47.303,000 --> 0:09:49,000
actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation.

214
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.

215
0:09:54.498,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Blissful productivity. I love it.

216
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer

217
0:09:59.578,000 --> 0:10:01,000
plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job.

218
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's because we know, when we're playing a game,

219
0:10:04.886,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that we're actually happier working hard

220
0:10:07.259,000 --> 0:10:09,000
than we are relaxing, or hanging out.

221
0:10:09.534,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We know that we are optimized as human beings,

222
0:10:11.836,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to do hard and meaningful work.

223
0:10:13.478,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And gamers are willing to work hard all the time,

224
0:10:16.709,000 --> 0:10:17,000
if they're given the right work.

225
0:10:19.089,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Finally: epic meaning.

226
0:10:21.034,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions

227
0:10:24.795,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to human planetary-scale stories.

228
0:10:28.831,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:

229
0:10:32.595,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.

230
0:10:36.617,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,

231
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is the World of Warcraft wiki.

232
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Five million people use it every month.

233
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet

234
0:10:47.943,000 --> 0:10:5,000
than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world.

235
0:10:51.074,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They are building an epic story.

236
0:10:53.134,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They are building an epic knowledge resource

237
0:10:55.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
about the World of Warcraft.

238
0:10:56.936,000 --> 0:11:,000
Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:

239
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals.

240
0:11:06.055,000 --> 0:11:09,000
These are people who believe that they are individually capable

241
0:11:09.284,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of changing the world.

242
0:11:10.858,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And the only problem is,

243
0:11:12.517,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds

244
0:11:15.57,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and not the real world.

245
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.

246
0:11:19.873,000 --> 0:11:21,000
There's an economist named Edward Castronova.

247
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
His work is brilliant.

248
0:11:23.454,000 --> 0:11:25,000
He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy

249
0:11:26.38,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and money in online worlds.

250
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And he says,

251
0:11:29.467,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus

252
0:11:32.799,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to virtual worlds and online game environments."

253
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And he's an economist, so he's rational.

254
0:11:37.473,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And he says --

255
0:11:38.934,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:40.601,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.

257
0:11:42.91,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But he says that this makes perfect sense,

258
0:11:47.133,000 --> 0:11:49,000
because gamers can achieve more in online worlds

259
0:11:49.581,000 --> 0:11:5,000
than they can in real life.

260
0:11:50.931,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They can have stronger social relationships in games

261
0:11:53.416,000 --> 0:11:54,000
than they can have in real life;

262
0:11:54.995,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games

263
0:11:57.986,000 --> 0:11:58,000
than they do in real life.

264
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense

265
0:12:01.284,000 --> 0:12:04,000
for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.

266
0:12:04.883,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now.

267
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.

268
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We have to start making the real world work more like a game.

269
0:12:14.637,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I take my inspiration from something that happened

270
0:12:17.643,000 --> 0:12:18,000
2,500 years ago.

271
0:12:19.652,000 --> 0:12:22,000
These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles.

272
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Before we had awesome game controllers,

273
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we had sheep's knuckles.

274
0:12:27.097,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And these represent the first game equipment

275
0:12:30.189,000 --> 0:12:31,000
designed by human beings,

276
0:12:32.079,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

277
0:12:35.847,000 --> 0:12:36,000
you might know this history,

278
0:12:37.38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which is the history of who invented games and why.

279
0:12:40.976,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games,

280
0:12:43.844,000 --> 0:12:45,000
were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,

281
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
during a time of famine.

282
0:12:48.093,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Apparently, there was such a severe famine

283
0:12:50.456,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy.

284
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
People were suffering. People were fighting.

285
0:12:56.38,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.

286
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,

287
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:

288
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
On one day, everybody would eat,

289
0:13:08.866,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and on the next day, everybody would play games.

290
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games,

291
0:13:13.918,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because games are so engaging,

292
0:13:15.386,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,

293
0:13:18.622,000 --> 0:13:2,000
they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.

294
0:13:21.36,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And then on the next day, they would play games;

295
0:13:23.67,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and on the next day, they would eat.

296
0:13:25.57,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And according to Herodotus,

297
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
they passed 18 years this way,

298
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
surviving through a famine,

299
0:13:31.023,000 --> 0:13:33,000
by eating on one day, and playing games on the next.

300
0:13:33.713,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today.

301
0:13:37.986,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We're using games to escape real-world suffering --

302
0:13:40.717,000 --> 0:13:41,000
we're using games to get away

303
0:13:42.332,000 --> 0:13:44,000
from everything that's broken in the real environment,

304
0:13:44.945,000 --> 0:13:46,000
everything that's not satisfying about real life,

305
0:13:47.515,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and we're getting what we need from games.

306
0:13:49.637,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But it doesn't have to end there.

307
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This is really exciting.

308
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better,

309
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
so the king decided they would play one final dice game.

310
0:14:02.668,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They divided the entire kingdom in half.

311
0:14:05.429,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They played one dice game,

312
0:14:07.161,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.

313
0:14:10.604,000 --> 0:14:11,000
They would leave Lydia,

314
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and they would go out in search of a new place to live,

315
0:14:15.259,000 --> 0:14:17,000
leaving behind just enough people

316
0:14:17.483,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to survive on the resources that were available,

317
0:14:19.8,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.

318
0:14:23.649,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Now, this sounds crazy, right?

319
0:14:25.572,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans,

320
0:14:30.014,000 --> 0:14:31,000
who then led to the Roman Empire,

321
0:14:31.8,000 --> 0:14:33,000
actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.

322
0:14:34.729,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And so, recently, scientists have suggested

323
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.

324
0:14:39.681,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling

325
0:14:42.674,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine.

326
0:14:46.434,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So this crazy story might be true.

327
0:14:48.688,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games,

328
0:14:52.608,000 --> 0:14:53,000
escaping to games for 18 years,

329
0:14:54.554,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and then been so inspired,

330
0:14:56.03,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and knew so much about how to come together with games,

331
0:14:58.736,000 --> 0:15:,000
that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.

332
0:15:01.497,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Okay, we can do that.

333
0:15:02.686,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Laughter)

334
0:15:03.732,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.

335
0:15:06.094,000 --> 0:15:09,000
That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series.

336
0:15:09.789,000 --> 0:15:1,000
That was 16 years ago.

337
0:15:11.6,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They played dice games for 18 years,

338
0:15:13.417,000 --> 0:15:15,000
we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.

339
0:15:15.687,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I say we are ready for our own epic game.

340
0:15:18.869,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world,

341
0:15:23.503,000 --> 0:15:26,000
so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.

342
0:15:27.376,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Let's get half of us to agree

343
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
to spend an hour a day playing games,

344
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
until we solve real-world problems.

345
0:15:33.126,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Now, I know you're asking,

346
0:15:34.722,000 --> 0:15:36,000
"How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?"

347
0:15:37.425,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Well, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years,

348
0:15:40.56,000 --> 0:15:41,000
at the Institute for the Future.

349
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,

350
0:15:44.57,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.

351
0:15:48.705,000 --> 0:15:5,000
We do not want to try to predict the future.

352
0:15:50.99,000 --> 0:15:52,000
What we want to do is make the future.

353
0:15:53.046,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,

354
0:15:55.562,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.

355
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
We want to imagine epic wins,

356
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.

357
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made

358
0:16:07.382,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins

359
0:16:10.462,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in their own futures.

360
0:16:11.819,000 --> 0:16:12,000
This is World Without Oil.

361
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We made this game in 2007.

362
0:16:14.975,000 --> 0:16:15,000
This is an online game

363
0:16:16.357,000 --> 0:16:18,000
in which you try to survive an oil shortage.

364
0:16:19.767,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The oil shortage is fictional,

365
0:16:21.386,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but we put enough online content out there

366
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
for you to believe that it's real,

367
0:16:25.964,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil.

368
0:16:28.874,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So when you come to the game,

369
0:16:30.334,000 --> 0:16:31,000
you sign up, tell us where you live,

370
0:16:32.287,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and then we give you real-time news videos,

371
0:16:34.651,000 --> 0:16:37,000
data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs,

372
0:16:37.795,000 --> 0:16:39,000
what's not available, how food supply is being affected,

373
0:16:40.548,000 --> 0:16:41,000
how transportation is being affected,

374
0:16:42.406,000 --> 0:16:44,000
if schools are closed, if there's rioting,

375
0:16:44.501,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life

376
0:16:47.374,000 --> 0:16:48,000
as if this were true.

377
0:16:48.637,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And then we ask you to blog about it,

378
0:16:50.46,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to post videos, to post photos.

379
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,

380
0:16:55.684,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and we've tracked them for the three years since.

381
0:16:58.041,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.

382
0:17:01.142,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Nobody wants to change how they live,

383
0:17:03.049,000 --> 0:17:06,000
just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.

384
0:17:06.778,000 --> 0:17:08,000
But if you immerse them in an epic adventure

385
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and tell them, "We've run out of oil.

386
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.

387
0:17:14.549,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Challenge yourself to see how you would survive,"

388
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
most of our players have kept up the habits

389
0:17:19.332,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that they learned in this game.

390
0:17:21.152,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So for the next world-saving game,

391
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil.

392
0:17:26.755,000 --> 0:17:29,000
We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future.

393
0:17:30.161,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated

394
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.

395
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
This supercomputer was called

396
0:17:37.833,000 --> 0:17:39,000
the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course.

397
0:17:40.594,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We asked people to come online --

398
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

399
0:17:44.383,000 --> 0:17:46,000
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team --

400
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,

401
0:17:50.035,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and they all have something to do to save the world.

402
0:17:52.496,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Laughter)

403
0:17:53.527,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team,

404
0:17:56.939,000 --> 0:17:57,000
we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,

405
0:17:58.892,000 --> 0:18:,000
and it's your job to invent the future of energy,

406
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
the future of food, the future of health,

407
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the future of security and the future of the social safety net."

408
0:18:06.332,000 --> 0:18:08,000
We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.

409
0:18:08.945,000 --> 0:18:11,000
They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions

410
0:18:12.017,000 --> 0:18:14,000
that you can go online, Google "Superstruct," and see.

411
0:18:14.871,000 --> 0:18:15,000
So, finally, the last game,

412
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
we're launching it March 3rd.

413
0:18:17.74,000 --> 0:18:19,000
This is a game done with the World Bank Institute.

414
0:18:20.198,000 --> 0:18:21,000
If you complete the game,

415
0:18:21.426,000 --> 0:18:23,000
you will be certified by the World Bank Institute

416
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.

417
0:18:26.982,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa,

418
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.

419
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up

420
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
in skills like local insight, knowledge networking,

421
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.

422
0:18:41.745,000 --> 0:18:42,000
I would like to invite all of you

423
0:18:43.356,000 --> 0:18:45,000
to please share this game with young people,

424
0:18:45.515,000 --> 0:18:47,000
anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,

425
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
who might benefit from coming together

426
0:18:50.482,000 --> 0:18:53,000
to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world.

427
0:18:55.01,000 --> 0:18:56,000
So, I'm going to wrap up now.

428
0:18:57.026,000 --> 0:18:58,000
I want to ask a question.

429
0:18:58.796,000 --> 0:18:59,000
What do you think happens next?

430
0:19:00.621,000 --> 0:19:02,000
We've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games

431
0:19:03.313,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that are kind of pilots of what we might do,

432
0:19:05.449,000 --> 0:19:07,000
but none of them have saved the real world yet.

433
0:19:07.679,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource

434
0:19:12.052,000 --> 0:19:14,000
that we can use to do real-world work,

435
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
that games are a powerful platform for change.

436
0:19:16.837,000 --> 0:19:17,000
We have all these amazing superpowers:

437
0:19:18.853,000 --> 0:19:21,000
blissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric,

438
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.

439
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter,

440
0:19:29.793,000 --> 0:19:31,000
to survive on this planet for another century.

441
0:19:32.043,000 --> 0:19:35,000
That's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.

442
0:19:35.719,000 --> 0:19:38,000
When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure:

443
0:19:39.543,000 --> 0:19:41,000
that we can make any future we can imagine,

444
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and we can play any games we want, so I say:

445
0:19:45.394,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Let the world-changing games begin.

446
0:19:47.134,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Thank you.

447
0:19:48.316,000 --> 0:19:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.417,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: Shep, thank you so much for coming.

2
0:00:15.875,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I think your plane landed literally two hours ago in Vancouver.

3
0:00:19.75,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Such a treat to have you.

4
0:00:21.208,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So, talk us through how do you get from Einstein's equation to a black hole?

5
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Sheperd Doeleman: Over 100 years ago,

6
0:00:29.208,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Einstein came up with this geometric theory of gravity

7
0:00:32.667,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which deforms space-time.

8
0:00:34.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, matter deforms space-time,

9
0:00:36.417,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and then space-time tells matter in turn how to move around it.

10
0:00:39.394,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And you can get enough matter into a small enough region

11
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that it punctures space-time,

12
0:00:45.208,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and that even light can't escape,

13
0:00:46.917,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the force of gravity keeps even light inside.

14
0:00:49.042,000 --> 0:00:52,000
CA: And so, before that, the reason the Earth moves around the Sun

15
0:00:52.167,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is not because the Sun is pulling the Earth as we think,

16
0:00:54.833,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but it's literally changed the shape of space

17
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
so that we just sort of fall around the Sun.

18
0:00:59.125,000 --> 0:01:,000
SD: Exactly, the geometry of space-time

19
0:01:01.042,000 --> 0:01:03,000
tells the Earth how to move around the Sun.

20
0:01:03.125,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You're almost seeing a black hole puncture through space-time,

21
0:01:06.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and when it goes so deeply in,

22
0:01:08.542,000 --> 0:01:11,000
then there's a point at which light orbits the black hole.

23
0:01:12.042,000 --> 0:01:14,000
CA: And so that's, I guess, is what's happening here.

24
0:01:14.583,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is not an image,

25
0:01:15.917,000 --> 0:01:17,000
this is a computer simulation of what we always thought,

26
0:01:18.917,000 --> 0:01:2,000
like, the event horizon around the black hole.

27
0:01:21.917,000 --> 0:01:24,000
SD: Until last week, we had no idea what a black hole really looked like.

28
0:01:25.417,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The best we could do were simulations like this in supercomputers,

29
0:01:29.375,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but even here you see this ring of light,

30
0:01:31.375,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which is the orbit of photons.

31
0:01:33.333,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That's where photons literally move around the black hole,

32
0:01:36.083,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and around that is this hot gas that's drawn to the black hole,

33
0:01:39.667,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and it's hot because of friction.

34
0:01:41.667,000 --> 0:01:44,000
All this gas is trying to get into a very small volume, so it heats up.

35
0:01:45.042,000 --> 0:01:47,000
CA: A few years ago, you embarked on this mission

36
0:01:47.917,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to try and actually image one of these things.

37
0:01:50.125,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I guess you took --

38
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you focused on this galaxy way out there.

39
0:01:54.792,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Tell us about this galaxy.

40
0:01:56.625,000 --> 0:01:57,000
SD: This is the galaxy --

41
0:01:58.458,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we're going to zoom into the galaxy M87, it's 55 million light-years away.

42
0:02:02.292,000 --> 0:02:03,000
CA: Fifty-five million.

43
0:02:03.542,000 --> 0:02:05,000
SD: Which is a long way.

44
0:02:05.583,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And at its heart,

45
0:02:07.25,000 --> 0:02:09,000
there's a six-and-a-half-billion- solar-mass black hole.

46
0:02:09.958,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That's hard for us to really fathom, right?

47
0:02:12.458,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Six and a half billion suns compressed into a single point.

48
0:02:16.75,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it's governing some of the energetics of the center of this galaxy.

49
0:02:21.167,000 --> 0:02:24,000
CA: But even though that thing is so huge, because it's so far away,

50
0:02:24.667,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to actually dream of getting an image of it,

51
0:02:27.583,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that's incredibly hard.

52
0:02:28.875,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The resolution would be incredible that you need.

53
0:02:31.208,000 --> 0:02:34,000
SD: Black holes are the smallest objects in the known universe.

54
0:02:34.25,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But they have these outsize effects on whole galaxies.

55
0:02:37.042,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But to see one,

56
0:02:38.333,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you would need to build a telescope as large as the Earth,

57
0:02:41.083,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because the black hole that we're looking at

58
0:02:43.208,000 --> 0:02:44,000
gives off copious radio waves.

59
0:02:44.708,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's emitting all the time.

60
0:02:46.083,000 --> 0:02:47,000
CA: And that's exactly what you did.

61
0:02:47.875,000 --> 0:02:48,000
SD: Exactly. What you're seeing here

62
0:02:49.667,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is we used telescopes all around the world,

63
0:02:51.75,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we synchronized them perfectly with atomic clocks,

64
0:02:54.167,000 --> 0:02:56,000
so they received the light waves from this black hole,

65
0:02:56.715,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and then we stitched all of that data together to make an image.

66
0:03:00.708,000 --> 0:03:01,000
CA: To do that

67
0:03:03.292,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the weather had to be right

68
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in all of those locations at the same time,

69
0:03:06.708,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so you could actually get a clear view.

70
0:03:08.625,000 --> 0:03:1,000
SD: We had to get lucky in a lot of different ways.

71
0:03:11.875,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good.

72
0:03:14.208,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In this case, we were both, I like to think.

73
0:03:16.917,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But light had to come from the black hole.

74
0:03:19.75,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It had to come through intergalactic space,

75
0:03:23.708,000 --> 0:03:26,000
through the Earth's atmosphere, where water vapor can absorb it,

76
0:03:27.417,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and everything worked out perfectly,

77
0:03:29.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the size of the Earth at that wavelength of light,

78
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:32,000
one millimeter wavelength,

79
0:03:33.083,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was just right to resolve that black hole, 55 million light-years away.

80
0:03:37.875,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The universe was telling us what to do.

81
0:03:40.708,000 --> 0:03:42,000
CA: So you started capturing huge amounts of data.

82
0:03:43.125,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I think this is like half the data from just one telescope.

83
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:49,000
SD: Yeah, this is one of the members of our team, Lindy Blackburn,

84
0:03:49.333,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and he's sitting with half the data

85
0:03:51.083,000 --> 0:03:53,000
recorded at the Large Millimeter Telescope,

86
0:03:53.167,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which is atop a 15,000-foot mountain in Mexico.

87
0:03:56.583,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And what he's holding there is about half a petabyte.

88
0:03:59.917,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Which, to put it in terms that we might understand,

89
0:04:03.208,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it's about 5,000 people's lifetime selfie budget.

90
0:04:07.167,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:09.333,000 --> 0:04:1,000
CA: It's a lot of data.

92
0:04:10.625,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So this was all shipped, you couldn't send this over the internet.

93
0:04:13.792,000 --> 0:04:14,000
All this data was shipped to one place

94
0:04:15.667,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the massive computer effort began to try and analyze it.

95
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you didn't really know

96
0:04:20.792,000 --> 0:04:22,000
what you were going to see coming out of this.

97
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
SD: The way this technique works that we used --

98
0:04:25.292,000 --> 0:04:28,000
imagine taking an optical mirror and smashing it

99
0:04:28.666,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and putting all the shards in different places.

100
0:04:30.916,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The way a normal mirror works

101
0:04:32.333,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is the light rays bounce off the surface, which is perfect,

102
0:04:35.167,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they focus in a certain point at the same time.

103
0:04:38.333,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We take all these recordings,

104
0:04:40.333,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and with atomic clock precision

105
0:04:41.917,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we align them perfectly, later in a supercomputer.

106
0:04:45.292,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we recreate kind of an Earth-sized lens.

107
0:04:47.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And the only way to do that is to bring the data back by plane.

108
0:04:50.917,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You can't beat the bandwidth of a 747 filled with hard discs.

109
0:04:54.625,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:55.667,000 --> 0:04:57,000
CA: And so, I guess a few weeks or a few months ago,

111
0:04:58.167,000 --> 0:04:59,000
on a computer screen somewhere,

112
0:04:59.833,000 --> 0:05:02,000
this started to come into view.

113
0:05:03.125,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This moment.

114
0:05:04.417,000 --> 0:05:06,000
SD: Well, it took a long time.

115
0:05:06.708,000 --> 0:05:07,000
CA: I mean, look at this.

116
0:05:09.708,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That was it.

117
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:12,000
That was the first image.

118
0:05:12.417,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

119
0:05:18.625,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So tell us what we're really looking at there.

120
0:05:20.958,000 --> 0:05:21,000
SD: I still love it.

121
0:05:22.333,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:25.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So what you're seeing is that last orbit of photons.

123
0:05:29.208,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You're seeing Einstein's geometry laid bare.

124
0:05:32.75,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The puncture in space-time is so deep

125
0:05:35.167,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that light moves around in orbit,

126
0:05:37.208,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so that light behind the black hole, as I think we'll see soon,

127
0:05:40.292,000 --> 0:05:42,000
moves around and comes to us on these parallel lines

128
0:05:43.25,000 --> 0:05:44,000
at exactly that orbit.

129
0:05:44.958,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It turns out, that orbit is the square root of 27

130
0:05:49.625,000 --> 0:05:51,000
times just a handful of fundamental constants.

131
0:05:52.625,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's extraordinary when you think about it.

132
0:05:54.667,000 --> 0:05:55,000
CA: When ...

133
0:05:56.625,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In my head, initially, when I thought of black holes,

134
0:05:59.333,000 --> 0:06:,000
I'm thinking that is the event horizon,

135
0:06:01.25,000 --> 0:06:04,000
there's lots of matter and light whirling around in that shape.

136
0:06:05.083,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But it's actually more complicated than that.

137
0:06:08.292,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, talk us through this animation, because it's light being lensed around it.

138
0:06:12.75,000 --> 0:06:15,000
SD: You'll see here that some light from behind it gets lensed,

139
0:06:16.125,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and some light does a loop-the-loop around the entire orbit of the black hole.

140
0:06:20.542,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But when you get enough light

141
0:06:22.042,000 --> 0:06:24,000
from all this hot gas swirling around the black hole,

142
0:06:24.875,000 --> 0:06:26,000
then you wind up seeing all of these light rays

143
0:06:27.792,000 --> 0:06:28,000
come together on this screen,

144
0:06:29.208,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which is a stand-in for where you and I are.

145
0:06:31.667,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And you see the definition of this ring begin to come into shape.

146
0:06:36.167,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And that's what Einstein predicted over 100 years ago.

147
0:06:40.167,000 --> 0:06:42,000
CA: Yeah, that is amazing.

148
0:06:42.25,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So tell us more about what we're actually looking at here.

149
0:06:48.042,000 --> 0:06:5,000
First of all, why is part of it brighter than the rest?

150
0:06:50.708,000 --> 0:06:53,000
SD: So what's happening is that the black hole is spinning.

151
0:06:54.5,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And you wind up with some of the gas moving towards us below

152
0:06:57.917,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and receding from us on the top.

153
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And just as the train whistle has a higher pitch

154
0:07:02.125,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when it's coming towards you,

155
0:07:03.542,000 --> 0:07:06,000
there's more energy from the gas coming towards us than going away from us.

156
0:07:07.333,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You see the bottom part brighter

157
0:07:08.917,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because the light is actually being boosted in our direction.

158
0:07:12.167,000 --> 0:07:13,000
CA: And how physically big is that?

159
0:07:14.167,000 --> 0:07:19,000
SD: Our entire solar system would fit well within that dark region.

160
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And if I may,

161
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that dark region is the signature of the event horizon.

162
0:07:26.083,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The reason we don't see light from there,

163
0:07:28.083,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is that the light that would come to us from that place

164
0:07:30.708,000 --> 0:07:31,000
was swallowed by the event horizon.

165
0:07:32.458,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So that -- that's it.

166
0:07:34.583,000 --> 0:07:35,000
CA: And so when we think of a black hole,

167
0:07:36.583,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you think of these huge rays jetting out of it,

168
0:07:39.167,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which are pointed directly in our direction.

169
0:07:41.292,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Why don't we see them?

170
0:07:42.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
SD: This is a very powerful black hole.

171
0:07:44.792,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Not by universal standards, it's still powerful,

172
0:07:48.125,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and from the north and south poles of this black hole

173
0:07:50.626,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we think that jets are coming.

174
0:07:52.375,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, we're too close to really see all the jet structure,

175
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but it's the base of those jets that are illuminating the space-time.

176
0:07:59.708,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And that's what's being bent around the black hole.

177
0:08:03.458,000 --> 0:08:06,000
CA: And if you were in a spaceship whirling around that thing somehow,

178
0:08:07.25,000 --> 0:08:09,000
how long would it take to actually go around it?

179
0:08:09.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
SD: First, I would give anything to be in that spaceship.

180
0:08:12.5,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:14.417,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Sign me up.

182
0:08:16.583,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There’s something called the -- if I can get wonky for one moment --

183
0:08:19.833,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the innermost stable circular orbit,

184
0:08:21.625,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole

185
0:08:25.042,000 --> 0:08:26,000
before it spirals in.

186
0:08:26.458,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And for this black hole, it's going to be between three days and about a month.

187
0:08:32.208,000 --> 0:08:35,000
CA: It's so powerful, it's weirdly slow at one level.

188
0:08:35.958,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I mean, you wouldn't even notice

189
0:08:38.833,000 --> 0:08:41,000
falling into that event horizon if you were there.

190
0:08:42.667,000 --> 0:08:44,000
SD: So you may have heard of "spaghettification,"

191
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where you fall into a black hole

192
0:08:46.582,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the gravitational field on your feet is much stronger than on your head,

193
0:08:50.207,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so you're ripped apart.

194
0:08:51.542,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This black hole is so big

195
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that you're not going to become a spaghetti noodle.

196
0:08:57.375,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You're just going to drift right through that event horizon.

197
0:09:00.25,000 --> 0:09:01,000
CA: So, it's like a giant tornado.

198
0:09:02.083,000 --> 0:09:05,000
When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado, she ended up in Oz.

199
0:09:05.625,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Where do you end up if you fall into a black hole?

200
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:09.875,000 --> 0:09:1,000
SD: Vancouver.

202
0:09:11.167,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:13.125,000 --> 0:09:14,000
CA: Oh, my God.

204
0:09:14.417,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

205
0:09:16.583,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's the red circle, that's terrifying.

206
0:09:20.292,000 --> 0:09:21,000
No, really.

207
0:09:21.625,000 --> 0:09:24,000
SD: Black holes really are the central mystery of our age,

208
0:09:25.208,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because that's where the quantum world and the gravitational world come together.

209
0:09:29.042,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What's inside is a singularity.

210
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And that's where all the forces become unified,

211
0:09:33.083,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because gravity finally is strong enough to compete with all the other forces.

212
0:09:37.708,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But it's hidden from us,

213
0:09:39.125,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the universe has cloaked it in the ultimate invisibility cloak.

214
0:09:43.208,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So we don't know what happens in there.

215
0:09:45.125,000 --> 0:09:47,000
CA: So there's a smaller one of these in our own galaxy.

216
0:09:47.792,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Can we go back to our own beautiful galaxy?

217
0:09:49.958,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is the Milky Way, this is home.

218
0:09:51.75,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And somewhere in the middle of that there's another one,

219
0:09:54.417,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which you're trying to find as well.

220
0:09:56.208,000 --> 0:09:59,000
SD: We already know it's there, and we've already taken data on it.

221
0:09:59.375,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And we're working on those data right now.

222
0:10:01.458,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So we hope to have something in the near future, I can't say when.

223
0:10:05.333,000 --> 0:10:07,000
CA: It's way closer but also a lot smaller,

224
0:10:07.625,000 --> 0:10:09,000
maybe the similar kind of size to what we saw?

225
0:10:09.917,000 --> 0:10:12,000
SD: Right. So it turns out that the black hole in M87,

226
0:10:13.458,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that we saw before,

227
0:10:14.75,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is six and a half billion solar masses.

228
0:10:16.958,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But it's so far away that it appears a certain size.

229
0:10:20.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The black hole in the center of our galaxy is a thousand times less massive,

230
0:10:23.667,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but also a thousand times closer.

231
0:10:25.333,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So it looks the same angular size on the sky.

232
0:10:29.042,000 --> 0:10:32,000
CA: Finally, I guess, a nod to a remarkable group of people.

233
0:10:32.292,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Who are these guys?

234
0:10:33.875,000 --> 0:10:35,000
SD: So these are only some of the team.

235
0:10:36.542,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We marveled at the resonance that this image has had.

236
0:10:42.167,000 --> 0:10:45,000
If you told me that it would be above the fold in all of these newspapers,

237
0:10:45.708,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm not sure I would have believed you, but it was.

238
0:10:48.167,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Because this is a great mystery,

239
0:10:49.738,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and it's inspiring for us, and I hope it's inspiring to everyone.

240
0:10:53.375,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But the more important thing is that this is just a small number of the team.

241
0:10:57.042,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We're 200 people strong with 60 institutes

242
0:10:59.958,000 --> 0:11:,000
and 20 countries and regions.

243
0:11:01.542,000 --> 0:11:04,000
If you want to build a global telescope you need a global team.

244
0:11:04.708,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And this technique that we use of linking telescopes around the world

245
0:11:08.667,000 --> 0:11:12,000
kind of effortlessly sidesteps some of the issues that divide us.

246
0:11:13.25,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And as scientists, we naturally come together to do something like this.

247
0:11:17.833,000 --> 0:11:2,000
CA: Wow, boy, that's inspiring for our whole team this week.

248
0:11:21.167,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Shep, thank you so much for what you did and for coming here.

249
0:11:24.049,000 --> 0:11:25,000
SD: Thank you.

250
0:11:25.333,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

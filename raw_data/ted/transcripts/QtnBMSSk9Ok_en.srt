1
0:00:06.913,000 --> 0:00:09,000
I'd like you to imagine what it would feel like

2
0:00:10.334,000 --> 0:00:14,000
if, for two whole minutes, your left arm was continuously flapping,

3
0:00:15.405,000 --> 0:00:17,000
your eyes were constantly rolling,

4
0:00:17.971,000 --> 0:00:18,000
your jaw was clenching so hard

5
0:00:19.925,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that it felt like your teeth were about to break,

6
0:00:22.725,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and every ten seconds,

7
0:00:24.456,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you were forced to let out a loud, high-pitched screech.

8
0:00:28.758,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Tic)

9
0:00:31.149,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is how I lived at the young age of six,

10
0:00:34.736,000 --> 0:00:37,000
every waking moment, seven days a week.

11
0:00:37.905,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Tic)

12
0:00:38.95,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And these were only some of my symptoms.

13
0:00:42.298,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When these symptoms surfaced, my life literally changed overnight.

14
0:00:46.395,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I could no longer go to school, see my friends or even eat out,

15
0:00:50.617,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because my tics would attract the attention of everyone in the room.

16
0:00:55.7,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In search for a cure, we flew to New York

17
0:00:58.287,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to meet with the best pediatric neuropsychologist my parents could find.

18
0:01:03.388,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Tic)

19
0:01:05.703,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But the doctor did not give us the easy remedy we had hoped for.

20
0:01:09.53,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Instead, she diagnosed me with an incurable neurological disorder,

21
0:01:14.117,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Tourette syndrome.

22
0:01:16.776,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Oftentimes, medication can be an essential and valuable part

23
0:01:20.196,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of many treatment processes.

24
0:01:22.466,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But in my case, the drugs only made things worse.

25
0:01:26.442,000 --> 0:01:28,000
One drug put me in a wheelchair,

26
0:01:28.498,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because my legs had gotten so numb that I couldn't move them.

27
0:01:33.157,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Another one caused me to hallucinate.

28
0:01:35.347,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I would see green people running after me,

29
0:01:37.793,000 --> 0:01:39,000
threatening to boil me in a pot and drink me as soup.

30
0:01:40.53,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And it was really scary.

31
0:01:42.815,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We tried drug after drug

32
0:01:44.237,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to find something that would bring me some sort of relief.

33
0:01:47.546,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But every single attempt just ended up making things worse.

34
0:01:53.038,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It is estimated that in 2013 in the United States alone,

35
0:01:58.289,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the prescription drug expenditure

36
0:01:59.988,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to treat neurological conditions and mental illness

37
0:02:02.956,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was about 89 billion dollars annually.

38
0:02:07.818,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But imagine if there were a way to treat these conditions

39
0:02:10.683,000 --> 0:02:13,000
without a price or without side effects.

40
0:02:15.112,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Imagine if your doctor prescribed you a daily dose of music.

41
0:02:20.067,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm here today to share with you my personal experience with music

42
0:02:24.463,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the effect that it had on my neurological disorder.

43
0:02:27.704,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Tic)

44
0:02:29.978,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Tourette syndrome is essentially a series

45
0:02:32.039,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of involuntary movements and sounds,

46
0:02:34.064,000 --> 0:02:35,000
known as tics.

47
0:02:36.374,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The best way for me to really describe what it's like to have Tourette syndrome

48
0:02:40.377,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is something I'm sure you're all very familiar with --

49
0:02:42.991,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the hiccups.

50
0:02:44.522,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You can try to stop yourself from the act.

51
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You can hold your breath and count to 10, or drink water upside down,

52
0:02:50.419,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but there is just nothing you can do about it

53
0:02:52.561,000 --> 0:02:55,000
until the sensation passes and the hiccups have taken their course.

54
0:02:57.441,000 --> 0:03:,000
I often lay on my bedroom floor after an attack of tics,

55
0:03:01.258,000 --> 0:03:03,000
feeling exhausted and in despair.

56
0:03:03.329,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Tic)

57
0:03:04.974,000 --> 0:03:07,000
My equally desperate mother would attempt to soothe me and herself

58
0:03:08.871,000 --> 0:03:09,000
by putting on some music.

59
0:03:10.958,000 --> 0:03:13,000
She would play peaceful music to soothe our aching hearts.

60
0:03:14.664,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we'd lie together on the floor

61
0:03:16.371,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and allow the beat of the drums to uplift us.

62
0:03:19.124,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And as the rhythms and the tunes unfolded,

63
0:03:21.752,000 --> 0:03:24,000
our spirits would rise, our moods would be lighter,

64
0:03:25.077,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and we would be rejuvenated.

65
0:03:27.142,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Tic)

66
0:03:29.922,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Very soon, and rather unknowingly, I became an addict of this newfound drug.

67
0:03:34.772,000 --> 0:03:37,000
When I found myself slipping into my bouts of sadness and self-pity,

68
0:03:38.736,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I would rush to the 88 keys of my piano,

69
0:03:41.323,000 --> 0:03:45,000
knowing in my heart that the tones and rhythms from each one of those keys

70
0:03:45.688,000 --> 0:03:46,000
would soon set me free.

71
0:03:47.981,000 --> 0:03:5,000
At the time, I didn't realize how much music was helping me.

72
0:03:51.283,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was just something I did by default.

73
0:03:53.845,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When I wrote my songs, it wasn't to impress anybody.

74
0:03:56.537,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It was just a release.

75
0:03:58.807,000 --> 0:04:,000
But the more I played, the less my symptoms surfaced,

76
0:04:01.577,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and the intensity of my attacks reduced.

77
0:04:04.466,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So I became curious as to how these songs were soothing my symptoms.

78
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I wondered if there were any other cases of medicinal music.

79
0:04:13.641,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So I began to search.

80
0:04:16.768,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I found that there was a highly successful US congresswoman,

81
0:04:19.758,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head.

82
0:04:22.56,000 --> 0:04:24,000
She lost her ability to speak.

83
0:04:25.187,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Because the ability to speak and the ability to sing

84
0:04:28.146,000 --> 0:04:3,000
lay in two separate parts of the brain,

85
0:04:30.363,000 --> 0:04:32,000
her doctors brought in music therapists to work with her.

86
0:04:33.887,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The therapists encouraged her to sing her thoughts,

87
0:04:36.307,000 --> 0:04:38,000
since she was incapable of speaking them.

88
0:04:38.474,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And through this technique,

89
0:04:39.856,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the congresswoman was finally able to regain her speech.

90
0:04:43.697,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Music helped heal Gabby Giffords.

91
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Scientists have found that music causes our brains to release a natural painkiller

92
0:04:51.752,000 --> 0:04:52,000
known as oxytocin

93
0:04:53.157,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and a feel-good chemical, dopamine.

94
0:04:55.625,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Dopamine is essential for a healthy nervous system

95
0:04:58.284,000 --> 0:05:,000
and strongly impacts emotional health.

96
0:05:01.149,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Music also affects our heart rate, breathing and pulse rate,

97
0:05:05.029,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as it stimulates blood flow.

98
0:05:07.242,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In addition, it lowers our cortisol levels,

99
0:05:10.116,000 --> 0:05:11,000
thus reducing anxiety,

100
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which is a common stimulant for neurological symptoms.

101
0:05:16.122,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In our lifetimes, we are all going to know someone with a neurological disorder.

102
0:05:21.05,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If it's not a family member --

103
0:05:22.828,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Tic)

104
0:05:24.019,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it could be a friend or a coworker.

105
0:05:26.784,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Please help me spread this message:

106
0:05:29.474,000 --> 0:05:33,000
music has the ability to uplift our lives and heal us from within.

107
0:05:34.616,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I still have Tourette syndrome.

108
0:05:36.275,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I deal with it every day, every hour.

109
0:05:38.555,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I'm going to deal with it for the rest of my life.

110
0:05:41.021,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And that means that I have to frequently excuse myself from my classroom,

111
0:05:44.561,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because my verbal tics can be extremely distracting.

112
0:05:47.957,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That means that sometimes when I wink my eyes involuntarily,

113
0:05:51.173,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the guy sitting opposite from me thinks I'm flirting with him,

114
0:05:54.147,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when I'm really not.

115
0:05:55.322,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:56.349,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And I have to tell him, "Sorry -- I wasn't trying to flirt."

117
0:05:59.704,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But the most amazing thing is

118
0:06:02.212,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that when I sing, play music and even just listen to music,

119
0:06:06.665,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I don't tic.

120
0:06:08.974,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I've been onstage numerous times in highly stressful situations,

121
0:06:12.768,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with thousands of people watching me.

122
0:06:15.22,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And while I do tic before my performance --

123
0:06:18.024,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Tic)

124
0:06:19.066,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when the music starts, the tics take a back seat.

125
0:06:23.993,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I may have written my own lyrics and composed my own music.

126
0:06:28.819,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But in reality, I've realized it was the music that composed me.

127
0:06:33.745,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Thank you.

128
0:06:34.935,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:43.634,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Tic)

130
0:06:47.247,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Music)

131
0:07:16.434,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Singing) I think I took my mask off too soon

132
0:07:20.276,000 --> 0:07:23,000
'Cause you were there and then you were not

133
0:07:23.318,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I think I pushed it all onto you

134
0:07:26.739,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I should have dragged it out dragged it out

135
0:07:29.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I think that maybe each time I lose a bit of myself I put it back on

136
0:07:36.569,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Just to fake it till I break my own heart in two

137
0:07:45.499,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And oh I wanted you to know the real me

138
0:07:51.961,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And take it seriously

139
0:07:57.465,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But now

140
0:07:58.66,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I'm not loving you I'm not loving you

141
0:08:01.89,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I'm not loving you

142
0:08:05.309,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I thought I could trust you

143
0:08:07.679,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But you're running away from me and my mask

144
0:08:11.903,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I'm not loving you I'm not loving you

145
0:08:15.258,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I'm not loving you

146
0:08:24.416,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Right now

147
0:08:27.49,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I think I took my mask off too soon

148
0:08:31.171,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Because you screamed when I pulled it off

149
0:08:34.132,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You told me you were unprepared

150
0:08:37.694,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And like that just like that

151
0:08:40.845,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I think that maybe this time it hurt more than it ever has before

152
0:08:47.666,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I think maybe this blow I took was a little more

153
0:08:52.564,000 --> 0:08:54,000
A little more

154
0:08:55.876,000 --> 0:09:,000
And oh I wanted you to know the real me

155
0:09:02.532,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And take it seriously

156
0:09:08.001,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But now

157
0:09:09.176,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I’m not loving you I'm not loving you

158
0:09:12.422,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I'm not loving you

159
0:09:15.894,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I thought I could trust you

160
0:09:18.241,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But you're running away from me and my mask

161
0:09:22.542,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I'm not loving you I'm not loving you

162
0:09:25.941,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I'm not loving you

163
0:09:35.68,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Right now

164
0:09:39.183,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

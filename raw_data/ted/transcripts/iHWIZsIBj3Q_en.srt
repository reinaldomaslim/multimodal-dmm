1
0:00:12.579,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public

2
0:00:16.048,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that it is possible to transmit a video

3
0:00:20.143,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

4
0:00:24.476,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver.

5
0:00:30.478,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.

6
0:00:33.093,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And you may wonder, what's the point?

7
0:00:35.951,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And the point is this:

8
0:00:38.399,000 --> 0:00:4,000
There will be a massive extension of the Internet

9
0:00:41.099,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to close the digital divide,

10
0:00:43.933,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" --

11
0:00:48.138,000 --> 0:00:51,000
tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.

12
0:00:51.328,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work

13
0:00:55.383,000 --> 0:00:57,000
if it's almost energy-neutral.

14
0:00:58.173,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible.

15
0:01:03.497,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.

16
0:01:08.959,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I demonstrated for the first time,

17
0:01:11.301,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at TED in 2011,

18
0:01:13.29,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

19
0:01:15.781,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast,

20
0:01:21.8,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and also in a safe and secure manner.

21
0:01:25.402,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Data is transported by the light,

22
0:01:28.307,000 --> 0:01:31,000
encoded in subtle changes of the brightness.

23
0:01:32.39,000 --> 0:01:35,000
If we look around, we have many LEDs around us,

24
0:01:35.978,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

25
0:01:41.393,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors,

26
0:01:46.656,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to receive the information encoded in the data.

27
0:01:50.94,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure

28
0:01:54.856,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

29
0:01:58.426,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.

30
0:02:03.016,000 --> 0:02:08,000
A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy.

31
0:02:08.549,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone.

32
0:02:13.559,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But now we need to remember

33
0:02:14.989,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED,

34
0:02:21.244,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

35
0:02:24.617,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so does the energy harvested from the solar cell.

36
0:02:28.579,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This means we have a principal mechanism in place

37
0:02:32.112,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to receive information from the light and by the solar cell,

38
0:02:38.246,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because the fluctuations of the energy harvested

39
0:02:41.045,000 --> 0:02:43,000
correspond to the data transmitted.

40
0:02:43.934,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Of course the question is:

41
0:02:46.084,000 --> 0:02:5,000
can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness,

42
0:02:50.268,000 --> 0:02:53,000
such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights?

43
0:02:54.641,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

44
0:02:58.637,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We have shown in the lab

45
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second

46
0:03:03.946,000 --> 0:03:05,000
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

47
0:03:06.921,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And this is faster than most broadband connections these days.

48
0:03:11.437,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now let me show you in practice.

49
0:03:17.095,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp.

50
0:03:23.193,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell;

51
0:03:25.792,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it is connected to the laptop.

52
0:03:28.949,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And also we have an instrument here

53
0:03:31.293,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell.

54
0:03:35.095,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And this instrument shows something at the moment.

55
0:03:37.917,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.

56
0:03:43.102,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light,

57
0:03:45.966,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

58
0:03:48.096,000 --> 0:03:5,000
for a moment,

59
0:03:50.228,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right.

60
0:03:54.904,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So the solar cell, for a moment,

61
0:03:56.618,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is harvesting energy from this artificial light source.

62
0:04:00.54,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

63
0:04:03.842,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I turn it on ...

64
0:04:05.049,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

65
0:04:08.586,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video.

66
0:04:15.418,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I've done this by pressing this button.

67
0:04:17.766,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video

68
0:04:22.513,000 --> 0:04:26,000
by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way,

69
0:04:26.669,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye,

70
0:04:29.191,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because the changes are too fast to recognize.

71
0:04:33.384,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But in order to prove the point,

72
0:04:35.807,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I can block the light of the solar cell.

73
0:04:40.087,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So first you notice the energy harvesting drops

74
0:04:43.334,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the video stops as well.

75
0:04:45.05,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If I remove the blockage, the video will restart.

76
0:04:49.357,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:55.61,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I can repeat that.

78
0:04:57.967,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well.

79
0:05:03.242,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.

80
0:05:08.079,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog.

81
0:05:14.106,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so I want to simulate fog,

82
0:05:16.433,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.

83
0:05:19.2,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

84
0:05:20.656,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell.

85
0:05:25.905,000 --> 0:05:26,000
First you notice

86
0:05:27.557,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

87
0:05:31.778,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but now the video still continues.

88
0:05:34.769,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This means, despite the blockage,

89
0:05:37.412,000 --> 0:05:4,000
there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell,

90
0:05:41.317,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information,

91
0:05:46.856,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in this case, a high-definition video.

92
0:05:51.04,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver

93
0:05:56.627,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light,

94
0:06:00.466,000 --> 0:06:04,000
while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device.

95
0:06:05.872,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's why it is possible

96
0:06:08.315,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut

97
0:06:12.196,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to act as a broadband receiver

98
0:06:14.713,000 --> 0:06:18,000
from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.

99
0:06:19.605,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell.

100
0:06:23.647,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the same is true

101
0:06:24.849,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for translucent solar cells integrated into windows,

102
0:06:28.666,000 --> 0:06:31,000
solar cells integrated into street furniture,

103
0:06:32.222,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices

104
0:06:36.789,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that will form the Internet of Things.

105
0:06:38.889,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because simply,

106
0:06:40.071,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we don't want to charge these devices regularly,

107
0:06:42.586,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or worse, replace the batteries every few months.

108
0:06:46.418,000 --> 0:06:47,000
As I said to you,

109
0:06:48.172,000 --> 0:06:5,000
this is the first time I've shown this in public.

110
0:06:50.514,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's very much a lab demonstration,

111
0:06:52.593,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a prototype.

112
0:06:54.276,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market

113
0:06:57.594,000 --> 0:06:58,000
within the next two to three years.

114
0:07:00.251,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide,

115
0:07:05.568,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and also contribute

116
0:07:06.79,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet.

117
0:07:10.37,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And all of this without causing

118
0:07:11.919,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a massive explosion of energy consumption --

119
0:07:14.395,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because of the solar cells, quite the opposite.

120
0:07:16.641,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Thank you.

121
0:07:17.818,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

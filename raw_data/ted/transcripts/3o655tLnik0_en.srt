1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I had been a photographer

2
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for 18 years

3
0:00:17.018,000 --> 0:00:19,000
before I began the Microsculpture Project.

4
0:00:19.436,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And in that time, I had shot global ad campaigns,

5
0:00:22.838,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had the opportunity to photograph some of my generation's icons,

6
0:00:27.043,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I was traveling the world.

7
0:00:29.248,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I got to a point in my career that I dreamed of getting to,

8
0:00:33.09,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and yet, for some reason, I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.

9
0:00:36.787,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Despite the extraordinary things I was shooting and experiencing,

10
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
they'd started to feel a little bit ordinary to me.

11
0:00:43.924,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was also getting concerned

12
0:00:45.475,000 --> 0:00:49,000
about how disposable photography had started to feel in the digital world,

13
0:00:49.625,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I really wanted to produce images that had a sense of worth again.

14
0:00:53.508,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I needed a subject that felt extraordinary.

15
0:00:57.594,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Sometimes I wish I had the eyes of a child.

16
0:00:59.976,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And by that I mean, I wish I could look at the world

17
0:01:02.544,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in the same as I did when I was a small boy.

18
0:01:05.293,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I think there is a danger, as we get older,

19
0:01:07.386,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that our curiosity becomes slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.

20
0:01:13.026,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And as a visual creator, one of the challenges for me

21
0:01:15.769,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is to present the familiar in a new and engaging way.

22
0:01:20.625,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Fortunately for me, though, I've got two great kids

23
0:01:23.148,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who are still curious about the world.

24
0:01:25.806,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Sebastian -- he's still curious about the world, and in 2014, in spring,

25
0:01:30.955,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he brought in a ground beetle from the garden.

26
0:01:33.836,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There was nothing particularly special about this insect --

27
0:01:36.658,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you know, it was a common species.

28
0:01:38.805,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But he was still curious,

29
0:01:40.179,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and he brought it up to my office,

30
0:01:42.611,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and we decided to look at it under his microscope.

31
0:01:45.062,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He had a little science kit for Christmas.

32
0:01:48.009,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And this is what we saw.

33
0:01:51.03,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, when I first saw this, it blew me away.

34
0:01:53.241,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Up here -- this is the back of the ground beetle.

35
0:01:56.302,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When I first saw it, it reminded me of a galaxy.

36
0:01:58.87,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And all the time, this had just been outside our window.

37
0:02:02.245,000 --> 0:02:04,000
You know, I was looking for this extraordinary subject,

38
0:02:04.954,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity to bring it in to me.

39
0:02:09.182,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So I decided to photograph it for him, and this is what I produced.

40
0:02:13.083,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I basically asked myself two simple questions.

41
0:02:15.853,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The first one:

42
0:02:17.043,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Could I take all my knowledge and skill of photographic lighting

43
0:02:20.885,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and take that onto a subject that's five millimeters long?

44
0:02:24.039,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But also: Could I keep creative control over that lighting

45
0:02:27.694,000 --> 0:02:28,000
on a subject that size?

46
0:02:29.434,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I practiced on some other found specimens,

47
0:02:32.764,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I approached the Oxford University Museum of Natural History

48
0:02:36.314,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to see if I could have access to their collection,

49
0:02:39.15,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to progress the project.

50
0:02:41.268,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I went up there for a meeting,

51
0:02:43.09,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I showed them some of the images that I'd been shooting,

52
0:02:45.99,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they could see the kind of detail I was able to get.

53
0:02:49.65,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I don't think they'd ever really seen anything quite like it before,

54
0:02:52.953,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and from that point forward, they gave me open access

55
0:02:55.479,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to their entire collection

56
0:02:56.817,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan, their entomologist.

57
0:03:01.953,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,

58
0:03:04.031,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I shot 37 insects from their collection.

59
0:03:07.718,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And the way I work

60
0:03:09.45,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is that I essentially split the insect up into multiple sections,

61
0:03:13.558,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I treat each one of those sections like a small still life.

62
0:03:17.39,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So for example, if I was photographing the eye of the insect,

63
0:03:21.134,000 --> 0:03:23,000
which is normally quite smooth and dome-shaped,

64
0:03:23.946,000 --> 0:03:27,000
then I'd use a light source that is large and soft and diffuse,

65
0:03:28.349,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so I don't get any harsh hot spots on that surface.

66
0:03:33.023,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But once my attention turns over to a hairy leg,

67
0:03:35.806,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that lighting setup will change completely.

68
0:03:38.403,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so I make that one tiny section look as beautiful as I possibly can,

69
0:03:42.064,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I work my way across the insect

70
0:03:43.912,000 --> 0:03:45,000
until I have about 20 or 25 different sections.

71
0:03:48.088,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The issue with photography at high magnification

72
0:03:51.949,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that there is inherently a very shallow depth of field.

73
0:03:55.218,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So to get around that, what I do is,

74
0:03:58.005,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I put my camera on a rail

75
0:03:59.471,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that I can automate to move 10 microns in between each shot.

76
0:04:02.838,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That's about one-seventh the width of a human hair.

77
0:04:05.985,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And then that provides me with a deep stack of images.

78
0:04:10.148,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Each has a tiny sliver of focus all the way through.

79
0:04:13.233,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I can squash that down

80
0:04:15.353,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to produce one image that is fully focused from front to back.

81
0:04:18.808,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So essentially, that gives me 25 sections that are fully focused

82
0:04:22.377,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and beautifully lit.

83
0:04:24.966,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, each one of my images

84
0:04:26.532,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is made up of anywhere between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.

85
0:04:31.366,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They take about three-and-a-half weeks to create,

86
0:04:33.967,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and the file sizes on average are about four gigabytes.

87
0:04:38.244,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I've got plenty of information to play with when I'm printing.

88
0:04:41.387,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And the prints at the exhibition are around the three-meter mark.

89
0:04:45.061,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In fact, I had a show in Milan two weeks ago,

90
0:04:47.648,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we had some prints there that were nine meters long.

91
0:04:52.025,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But, you know, I realize

92
0:04:53.225,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that these images still have to work in the digital world.

93
0:04:56.157,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There's no point in me putting all my blood, sweat and tears

94
0:04:59.273,000 --> 0:05:,000
into these pictures

95
0:05:00.448,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if they're only going to be showing 500 pixels on a screen.

96
0:05:03.597,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So with the help of Rob Chandler and Will Cookson,

97
0:05:07.162,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we developed a website

98
0:05:08.98,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that enables the viewer to immerse themselves

99
0:05:11.809,000 --> 0:05:13,000
into the full four-gigabyte files,

100
0:05:13.858,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and they can explore all that microscopic detail.

101
0:05:17.343,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So if you have the time, and I encourage you,

102
0:05:19.541,000 --> 0:05:2,000
please visit microsculpture.net

103
0:05:21.332,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and go and have a play.

104
0:05:22.871,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's good fun.

105
0:05:25.902,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I first showed the work at Oxford,

106
0:05:27.868,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and since then, it's moved on to the Middle East.

107
0:05:30.816,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's now back in Europe and goes to Copenhagen this month.

108
0:05:33.961,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And the feedback has been great.

109
0:05:36.746,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You know, I get emails, actually, from all over the world --

110
0:05:41.415,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from teachers, at the moment, who are using the website in school.

111
0:05:44.594,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The kids are using them on the tablet.

112
0:05:46.446,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They're zooming into the pictures

113
0:05:48.171,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and using it for art class, biology class.

114
0:05:50.816,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And that's not something I planned.

115
0:05:52.594,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's just a beautiful offshoot of the project.

116
0:05:55.98,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In fact, one of the things I like to do at the exhibitions

117
0:05:58.862,000 --> 0:06:,000
is actually look at the kiddies' reactions.

118
0:06:00.963,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And, you know, standing in front of a three-meter insect,

119
0:06:03.71,000 --> 0:06:04,000
they could have been horrified.

120
0:06:05.269,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But they're not. They look in wonder.

121
0:06:07.179,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This little chap here, he stood there for five minutes, motionless.

122
0:06:10.649,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:12.135,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And at the end of the day, actually, at the end of the day at the exhibitions,

124
0:06:16.072,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we have to wipe down the lower third of the big prints --

125
0:06:19.117,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:20.14,000 --> 0:06:22,000
just to remove all those sticky handprints,

127
0:06:22.339,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because all they want to do is touch those big bugs.

128
0:06:26.899,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I do want to leave you with one final image, if that's OK.

129
0:06:29.754,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This has to do with Charles Darwin.

130
0:06:31.827,000 --> 0:06:33,000
One of the recent images that I photographed

131
0:06:35.368,000 --> 0:06:36,000
was this one here.

132
0:06:37.797,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I'm talking about the creature in the box, not my cat.

133
0:06:40.552,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And this is a shield bug

134
0:06:43.335,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that Charles Darwin brought back from Australia

135
0:06:46.532,000 --> 0:06:48,000
on the HMS Beagle in 1836.

136
0:06:49.757,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And when I got it home,

137
0:06:51.545,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I stood in my kitchen and stared at it for about 20 minutes.

138
0:06:54.438,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I couldn't believe I was in possession of this beautiful creature.

139
0:06:58.275,000 --> 0:07:,000
And at that moment, I kind of realized

140
0:07:00.568,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that this validated the project for me.

141
0:07:02.455,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The fact that the museum was willing to risk me playing with this

142
0:07:05.957,000 --> 0:07:07,000
kind of showed me that my images had worth --

143
0:07:08.307,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you know, they weren't disposable.

144
0:07:10.742,000 --> 0:07:11,000
That's the image that I produced.

145
0:07:12.693,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I often wonder, still, when I look at this:

146
0:07:14.843,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What would Charles Darwin make of these images?

147
0:07:17.347,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Do you think he'd like his picture of his shield bug? I hope so.

148
0:07:20.969,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So --

149
0:07:22.157,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

150
0:07:26.633,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You know, I think it's strange in a way.

151
0:07:28.604,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I'm a visual person, I'm a creative person,

152
0:07:30.686,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but I still needed the eyes of a child to find my extraordinary subject.

153
0:07:35.485,000 --> 0:07:36,000
That's the way it was.

154
0:07:36.672,000 --> 0:07:38,000

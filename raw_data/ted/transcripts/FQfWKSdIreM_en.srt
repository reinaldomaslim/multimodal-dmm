0:00:13.349,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Can you imagine what the word "TED" would have looked like

3
0:00:16.175,000 --> 0:00:18,000
if it had existed during the Roman Empire?

4
0:00:20.337,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I think maybe something like this.

5
0:00:23.53,000 --> 0:00:29,000
An artisan would have spent days in the sun chiseling it into stone.

6
0:00:31.063,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And in the Middle Ages?

7
0:00:34.975,000 --> 0:00:37,000
A monk, locked in his room,

8
0:00:38.869,000 --> 0:00:43,000
would write T-E-D with his pen.

9
0:00:45.588,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And without going so far back in time,

10
0:00:47.457,000 --> 0:00:49,000
how would these letters have looked in the 80s?

11
0:00:53.358,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They would have had electric, strange colors,

12
0:00:56.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
just like our hairstyles.

13
0:00:58.251,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

14
0:01:00.612,000 --> 0:01:02,000
If this event were about children,

15
0:01:04.689,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I would draw the letters like this,

16
0:01:07.482,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as if they were building blocks,

17
0:01:10.835,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in vivid colors.

18
0:01:12.498,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And if it were about superheroes instead?

19
0:01:16.47,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I would do them like this,

20
0:01:18.044,000 --> 0:01:21,000
inspired by -- in my opinion -- the greatest of all:

21
0:01:21.979,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Superman.

22
0:01:23.557,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:25.075,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The shapes of these letters talk.

24
0:01:29.219,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They tell us things beyond what they represent.

25
0:01:33.751,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They send us to different eras,

26
0:01:35.883,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they convey values,

27
0:01:37.909,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they tell us stories.

28
0:01:42.481,000 --> 0:01:45,000
If we think about it, our days are full of letters.

29
0:01:45.596,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We see them on the front of the bus,

30
0:01:47.656,000 --> 0:01:49,000
on the bakery's facade,

31
0:01:49.902,000 --> 0:01:5,000
on the keyboard we write on,

32
0:01:51.865,000 --> 0:01:52,000
on our cell phones --

33
0:01:53.632,000 --> 0:01:54,000
everywhere.

34
0:01:56.566,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Since the beginning of history,

35
0:01:58.096,000 --> 0:02:01,000
people have felt the need to give language an image.

36
0:02:01.439,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And rightly so,

37
0:02:03.119,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because language is the most important communication tool we have.

38
0:02:08.984,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Without understanding what a word means,

39
0:02:11.53,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we can see certain things it conveys.

40
0:02:15.572,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Some letters tell us that something is modern --

41
0:02:17.905,000 --> 0:02:19,000
at least it was back in the 70s.

42
0:02:22.625,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Others verify the importance and monumentality of a place,

43
0:02:27.071,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and they do so in uppercase.

44
0:02:29.298,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There are letters not made to last long --

45
0:02:32.253,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and neither is the opportunity they communicate.

46
0:02:36.067,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And there are letters made by inexperienced hands

47
0:02:39.451,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that, whether they mean to or not,

48
0:02:41.174,000 --> 0:02:43,000
make us imagine what a place looks like inside.

49
0:02:45.381,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I moved to Berlin, I experienced firsthand

50
0:02:48.848,000 --> 0:02:52,000
all the impact that drawn letters can have in our day-to-day life.

51
0:02:54.679,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I arrived in a new city, which was exciting and novel for me.

52
0:02:58.207,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, dealing with an unfamiliar language was at times very frustrating

53
0:03:04.932,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and uncomfortable.

54
0:03:06.369,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I found myself several times at parties clutching my glass of wine,

55
0:03:11.103,000 --> 0:03:15,000
without understanding a single word of what was being said around me.

56
0:03:17.214,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And of course, I'd smile as if I understood everything.

57
0:03:22.386,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I felt limited in my ability to say what I thought,

58
0:03:27.179,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what I felt,

59
0:03:29.802,000 --> 0:03:3,000
what I believed.

60
0:03:33.316,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Not only did I not understand the conversations,

61
0:03:35.611,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but the streets were full of signs and text that I couldn't read.

62
0:03:41.441,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But the shapes of the letters gave me clues;

63
0:03:46.104,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they would open up a little window

64
0:03:48.561,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to understanding the stories enclosed in those shapes.

65
0:03:54.365,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I recognized places where tradition was important.

[Bakery Pastries Café Restaurant]

67
0:03:59.764,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Or I'd know when someone was trying to give me a signal,

68
0:04:02.661,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and my gut would tell me it was better to stay away.

69
0:04:05.624,000 --> 0:04:06,000
[No trespassing!]

70
0:04:07.43,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I could also tell when something was made to last forever.

71
0:04:10.307,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The shapes of letters helped me understand my surroundings better

72
0:04:13.652,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and navigate the city.

73
0:04:15.563,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was in Paris recently,

74
0:04:17.493,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and something similar happened to me.

75
0:04:19.709,000 --> 0:04:21,000
After a few days in the city,

76
0:04:21.832,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I was on the lookout for something tasty to take back home.

77
0:04:25.433,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So I walked and walked and walked until I found the perfect bakery.

78
0:04:31.132,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The sign said it all.

79
0:04:32.793,000 --> 0:04:33,000
[Bakery]

80
0:04:34.468,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I see it, and even today, I imagine the master baker

81
0:04:37.591,000 --> 0:04:39,000
dedicating the same amount of time to each loaf of bread

82
0:04:40.527,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that the craftsman dedicated to each letter of this word.

83
0:04:44.451,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I can see the bread, with just the right ingredients,

84
0:04:48.23,000 --> 0:04:5,000
being kneaded softly and carefully,

85
0:04:50.712,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in the same way the craftsman drew the ends of the letters

86
0:04:54.84,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with smooth and precise curves.

87
0:04:58.565,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I see the master baker placing the buns over a thin layer of flour

88
0:05:03.712,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so the bottoms don't burn.

89
0:05:05.688,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I think of the craftsman putting the mosaics in the oven one by one,

90
0:05:10.807,000 --> 0:05:12,000
being careful to not let the ink run.

91
0:05:14.541,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The love for detail that the master baker has

92
0:05:18.027,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is reflected in the attention that went into creating this sign.

93
0:05:23.746,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Without having tried their bread, we already imagine it tastes good.

94
0:05:28.301,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I can vouch for it; it was delicious.

95
0:05:33.2,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm a letterer; that's my job --

96
0:05:36.66,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to draw letters.

97
0:05:39.328,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Just like when you make bread, it requires care in its preparation,

98
0:05:43.438,000 --> 0:05:45,000
just the right amount of ingredients

99
0:05:45.985,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and love for the details.

100
0:05:48.585,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Our alphabet is at the same time my raw material and my limitation.

101
0:05:53.251,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The basic structure of the letters is for me a playing field,

102
0:05:56.548,000 --> 0:06:,000
where the only rule is that the reader, at the end of the road,

103
0:06:01.364,000 --> 0:06:02,000
will be able to read the message.

104
0:06:04.27,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Let me show you how I work,

105
0:06:06.827,000 --> 0:06:07,000
how I "knead my bread."

106
0:06:10.388,000 --> 0:06:14,000
A while back, I was commissioned to design the cover of a classic book,

107
0:06:14.98,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"Alice in Wonderland."

108
0:06:18.016,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Alice falls in a burrow

109
0:06:19.763,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and begins an absurd journey through a world of fantasy, remember?

110
0:06:24.415,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In this situation, the title of the story is my raw material.

111
0:06:31.046,000 --> 0:06:34,000
At first glance, there are elements that are not very important,

112
0:06:34.364,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I can decide to make them smaller.

113
0:06:36.272,000 --> 0:06:4,000
For example, I'll write "in" on a smaller scale.

114
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Then I'll try some other ideas.

115
0:06:43.273,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What if, to communicate the idea of "wonder,"

116
0:06:45.858,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I used my best handwriting,

117
0:06:48.95,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with lots of curleycues here and there?

118
0:06:52.96,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Or what if I focused more on the fact that the book is a classic

119
0:06:56.745,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and used more conventional lettering,

120
0:07:00.118,000 --> 0:07:03,000
making everything look a little more stiff and serious,

121
0:07:04.022,000 --> 0:07:07,000
like in an encyclopedia or old books?

122
0:07:08.847,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Or how would it look, considering this book has so much gibberish,

123
0:07:13.743,000 --> 0:07:16,000
if I combined both universes in a single arrangement:

124
0:07:18.378,000 --> 0:07:23,000
rigid letters and smooth letters living together in the same composition.

125
0:07:25.496,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I like this idea, and I'll work on it in detail.

126
0:07:30.033,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I use another sheet of paper to work more comfortably.

127
0:07:34.58,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I mark some guidelines,

128
0:07:36.776,000 --> 0:07:39,000
delimiting the framework where the words will be.

129
0:07:41.923,000 --> 0:07:43,000
There, I can start giving form to each letter.

130
0:07:44.572,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I work carefully.

131
0:07:46.638,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I dedicate time to each letter without losing sight of the whole.

132
0:07:51.974,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I draw the ends of the letters methodically.

133
0:07:55.45,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Are they square or round?

134
0:07:58.986,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Are they pointy or plump and smooth?

135
0:08:04.213,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I always make several sketches,

136
0:08:05.851,000 --> 0:08:08,000
where I'll try different ideas or change elements.

137
0:08:10.459,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And there comes a point when the drawing turns into precise forms,

138
0:08:14.93,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with colors, volumes and decorative elements.

139
0:08:19.783,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Alice, the celebrity here, is placed at the front

140
0:08:23.113,000 --> 0:08:24,000
with volume in her letters.

141
0:08:25.545,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Lots of points and lines playing in the background

142
0:08:28.767,000 --> 0:08:31,000
help me convey that in this story, lots of things happen.

143
0:08:32.724,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And it helps to represent the feeling it generates,

144
0:08:35.173,000 --> 0:08:37,000
as if you had your head in the clouds.

145
0:08:38.78,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And of course, there's Alice, looking at her wonderland.

146
0:08:47.444,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Drawing the letters of this title, I recreate the text's atmosphere a little.

147
0:08:53.66,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I let the reader see the story through a peephole in the door.

148
0:08:58.681,000 --> 0:09:,000
To do that, I gave shape to concepts and ideas

149
0:09:01.205,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that already exist in our imagination:

150
0:09:04.047,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the idea of dreams,

151
0:09:06.148,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of chaos,

152
0:09:07.802,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the concept of wonder.

153
0:09:12.284,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The typography and the shape of letters work a bit like gestures

154
0:09:17.049,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and tone of voice.

155
0:09:18.817,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's not the same to say,

156
0:09:21.541,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(In a flat tone of voice) "TEDxRíodelaPlata's audience is huge,"

157
0:09:24.885,000 --> 0:09:29,000
as it is to say (In an animated voice), "TEDxRíodelaPlata's audience is huge!"

158
0:09:31.713,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Gestures and tone are part of the message.

159
0:09:36.7,000 --> 0:09:37,000
By giving shape to the letters,

160
0:09:38.714,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I can decide more precisely what I mean to say and how,

161
0:09:42.726,000 --> 0:09:43,000
beyond the literal text.

162
0:09:47.397,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I can say my favorite swear word in a very flowery way

163
0:09:53.801,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and be really corny when I talk about love.

164
0:09:58.541,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I can talk loudly and in a grandiose way

165
0:10:03.899,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or in a soft and poetic voice.

166
0:10:09.581,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And I can communicate the difference between Buenos Aires

167
0:10:15.275,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and Berlin,

168
0:10:18.7,000 --> 0:10:19,000
two cities I know very well.

169
0:10:23.089,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It was precisely in Berlin where my work became more colorful,

170
0:10:27.809,000 --> 0:10:28,000
more expressive,

171
0:10:30.008,000 --> 0:10:32,000
more precise at telling stories.

172
0:10:33.441,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Everything I couldn't say at those parties,

173
0:10:36.103,000 --> 0:10:38,000
standing there holding my glass of wine,

174
0:10:38.877,000 --> 0:10:41,000
exploded in shapes and colors on paper.

175
0:10:44.379,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Without my realizing it, this limitation that language has

176
0:10:47.881,000 --> 0:10:48,000
became an engine

177
0:10:49.91,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that propelled me to perfect the tools with which I could express myself.

178
0:10:55.672,000 --> 0:10:56,000
If I couldn't say it by speaking,

179
0:10:58.164,000 --> 0:11:,000
this was my way of talking

180
0:11:01.155,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and telling things to the world.

181
0:11:05.398,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Since then, my big quest has been to find my own voice

182
0:11:09.56,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and to tell stories with the exact tone and gesture I want.

183
0:11:15.957,000 --> 0:11:16,000
No more, no less.

184
0:11:19.86,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That's why I combine colors,

185
0:11:23.487,000 --> 0:11:24,000
textures

186
0:11:25.026,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and of course, letters,

187
0:11:28.632,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which are the heart.

188
0:11:31.183,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And that's why I always want them to have shapes that are truly beautiful

189
0:11:36.435,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and exquisite.

190
0:11:38.879,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Telling stories by drawing letters --

191
0:11:41.607,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that's my job.

192
0:11:44.501,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And with that I look for a reaction in the reader,

193
0:11:46.896,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to wake them up somehow,

194
0:11:49.272,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to make them dream,

195
0:11:51.109,000 --> 0:11:52,000
make them feel moved.

196
0:11:54.203,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I believe that if the message is important,

197
0:11:57.279,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it requires work and craftsmanship.

198
0:12:00.314,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And if the reader is important,

199
0:12:03.365,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they deserve beauty and fantasy as well.

200
0:12:07.714,000 --> 0:12:1,000

1
0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I visit the future for a living.

2
0:00:16.265,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Not just one future,

3
0:00:17.915,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but many possible futures,

4
0:00:20.185,000 --> 0:00:24,000
bringing back evidences from those futures for you to experience today.

5
0:00:25.197,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Like an archaeologist of the future.

6
0:00:28.432,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Over the years, my many journeys have brought back things

7
0:00:31.188,000 --> 0:00:34,000
like a new species of synthetically engineered bees;

8
0:00:37.052,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a book named, "Pets as Protein;"

9
0:00:40.263,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a machine that makes you rich by trading your genetic data;

10
0:00:43.451,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a lamp powered by sugar;

11
0:00:46.045,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a computer for growing food.

12
0:00:48.573,000 --> 0:00:52,000
OK, so I don't actually travel to different futures -- yet.

13
0:00:52.988,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But my husband Jon and I spend a lot of time thinking

14
0:00:55.951,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and creating visions of different futures in our studio.

15
0:01:00.081,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We are constantly looking out for weak signals,

16
0:01:02.881,000 --> 0:01:04,000
those murmurs of future potential.

17
0:01:05.279,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Then we trace those threads of potential out into the future, asking:

18
0:01:09.963,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What might it feel like to live in this future?

19
0:01:13.068,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What might we see, hear and even breathe?

20
0:01:17.157,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Then we run experiments, build prototypes, make objects,

21
0:01:21.63,000 --> 0:01:23,000
bringing aspects of these futures to life,

22
0:01:23.684,000 --> 0:01:25,000
making them concrete and tangible

23
0:01:26.02,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so you can really feel the impact of those future possibilities

24
0:01:30.798,000 --> 0:01:31,000
here and now.

25
0:01:32.936,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But this work is not about predictions.

26
0:01:35.761,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's about creating tools --

27
0:01:37.792,000 --> 0:01:4,000
tools that can help connect our present and our future selves

28
0:01:41.28,000 --> 0:01:45,000
so we become active participants in creating a future we want --

29
0:01:45.709,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a future that works for all.

30
0:01:48.758,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So how do we go about doing this?

31
0:01:51.143,000 --> 0:01:54,000
For a recent project called Drone Aviary,

32
0:01:54.511,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we were interested in exploring

33
0:01:56.073,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what it would mean to live with drones in our cities.

34
0:01:59.064,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Drones that have the power to see things we can't,

35
0:02:01.921,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to go places we can't

36
0:02:03.697,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and to do so with increasing autonomy.

37
0:02:06.734,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But to understand the technology,

38
0:02:08.348,000 --> 0:02:09,000
getting our hands dirty was crucial.

39
0:02:10.652,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So we built several different drones in our studio.

40
0:02:13.506,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We gave them names, functions and then flew them --

41
0:02:17.395,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but not without difficulty.

42
0:02:19.413,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Things came loose,

43
0:02:20.826,000 --> 0:02:21,000
GPS signals glitched

44
0:02:22.47,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and drones crashed.

45
0:02:24.599,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But it was through such experimentation

46
0:02:26.765,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that we could construct a very concrete and very experiential slice

47
0:02:30.964,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of one possible future.

48
0:02:33.613,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So now, let's go to that future.

49
0:02:36.199,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Let's imagine we are living in a city with drones like this one.

50
0:02:40.196,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We call it The Nightwatchman.

51
0:02:42.756,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It patrols the streets, often spotted in the evenings and at night.

52
0:02:47.239,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Initially, many of us were annoyed by its low, dull hum.

53
0:02:51.144,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But then, like everything else, we got used to it.

54
0:02:54.423,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, what if you could see the world through its eyes?

55
0:02:58.615,000 --> 0:03:02,000
See how it constantly logs every resident of our neighborhood;

56
0:03:02.961,000 --> 0:03:05,000
logging the kids who play football in the no-ballgame area

57
0:03:06.305,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and marking them as statutory nuisances.

58
0:03:08.776,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:10.237,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And then see how it disperses this other group, who are teenagers,

60
0:03:14.231,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with the threat of an autonomously issued injunction.

61
0:03:18.387,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And then there's this giant floating disc called Madison.

62
0:03:22.203,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Its glaring presence is so overpowering,

63
0:03:24.447,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I can't help but stare at it.

64
0:03:27.242,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But if feels like each time I look at it,

65
0:03:29.267,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it knows a little more about me --

66
0:03:31.914,000 --> 0:03:34,000
like it keeps flashing all these Brianair adverts at me,

67
0:03:35.103,000 --> 0:03:37,000
as if it knows about the holiday I'm planning.

68
0:03:38.479,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm not sure if I find this mildly entertaining

69
0:03:42.23,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or just entirely invasive.

70
0:03:45.684,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Back to the present.

71
0:03:47.611,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In creating this future, we learned a lot.

72
0:03:50.352,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Not just about how these machines work,

73
0:03:52.982,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but what it would feel like to live alongside them.

74
0:03:56.239,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Whilst drones like Madison and Nightwatchman,

75
0:03:58.517,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in these particular forms,

76
0:04:00.058,000 --> 0:04:01,000
are not real yet,

77
0:04:01.623,000 --> 0:04:04,000
most elements of a drone future are in fact very real today.

78
0:04:06.264,000 --> 0:04:07,000
For instance,

79
0:04:07.439,000 --> 0:04:09,000
facial recognition systems are everywhere --

80
0:04:09.777,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in our phones, even in our thermostats

81
0:04:12.211,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and in cameras around our cities --

82
0:04:14.714,000 --> 0:04:16,000
keeping a record of everything we do,

83
0:04:17.484,000 --> 0:04:21,000
whether it's an advertisement we glanced at or a protest we attended.

84
0:04:21.693,000 --> 0:04:22,000
These things are here,

85
0:04:23.387,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and we often don't understand how they work,

86
0:04:26.135,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and what their consequences could be.

87
0:04:29.279,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And we see this all around us.

88
0:04:30.883,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This difficulty in even imagining

89
0:04:32.679,000 --> 0:04:36,000
how the consequences of our actions today will affect our future.

90
0:04:37.649,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Last year, where I live, in the UK, there was a referendum

91
0:04:40.558,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where the people could vote for the UK to leave the EU

92
0:04:43.107,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or stay in the EU,

93
0:04:44.289,000 --> 0:04:45,000
popularly known as "Brexit."

94
0:04:46.819,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And soon after the results came out,

95
0:04:48.645,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a word began to surface called "Bregret" --

96
0:04:51.684,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:52.748,000 --> 0:04:55,000
describing people who chose to vote for Brexit as a protest,

98
0:04:56.207,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but without thinking through its potential consequences.

99
0:05:01.127,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And this disconnect is evident in some of the simplest things.

100
0:05:05.795,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Say you go out for a quick drink.

101
0:05:07.688,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Then you decide you wouldn't mind a few more.

102
0:05:10.446,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know you'll wake up in the morning feeling awful,

103
0:05:13.09,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but you justify it by saying,

104
0:05:14.496,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"The other me in the future will deal with that."

105
0:05:17.607,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But as we find out in the morning,

106
0:05:19.499,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that future "you" is you.

107
0:05:22.454,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When I was growing up in India in the late '70s and early '80s,

108
0:05:25.675,000 --> 0:05:26,000
there was a feeling

109
0:05:26.85,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that the future both needed to and could actually be planned.

110
0:05:30.343,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I remember my parents had to plan for some of the simplest things.

111
0:05:33.627,000 --> 0:05:35,000
When they wanted a telephone in our house,

112
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:37,000
they needed to order it and then wait --

113
0:05:38.014,000 --> 0:05:41,000
wait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house.

114
0:05:41.285,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:42.343,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And then if they wanted to call my grandparents who lived in another city,

116
0:05:45.865,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they needed to book something called a "trunk call,"

117
0:05:48.417,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then wait again, for hours or even days.

118
0:05:51.298,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And then abruptly, the phone would ring at two in the morning,

119
0:05:54.259,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and all of us would jump out of our beds and gather round the phone,

120
0:05:57.533,000 --> 0:05:59,000
shrieking into it, discussing general well-being

121
0:05:59.872,000 --> 0:06:,000
at two in the morning.

122
0:06:01.229,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Today it can feel like things are happening too fast --

123
0:06:05.033,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so fast, that it can become really difficult

124
0:06:07.312,000 --> 0:06:09,000
for us to form an understanding of our place in history.

125
0:06:10.293,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It creates an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and anxiety,

126
0:06:13.744,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and so, we let the future just happen to us.

127
0:06:18.032,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We don't connect with that future "us."

128
0:06:20.528,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We treat our future selves as a stranger,

129
0:06:22.864,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the future as a foreign land.

130
0:06:25.735,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's not a foreign land;

131
0:06:26.944,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it's unfolding right in front of us,

132
0:06:28.716,000 --> 0:06:3,000
continually being shaped by our actions today.

133
0:06:31.734,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We are that future,

134
0:06:33.94,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and so I believe fighting for a future we want

135
0:06:36.794,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is more urgent and necessary than ever before.

136
0:06:40.297,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We have learned in our work

137
0:06:41.786,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that one of the most powerful means of effecting change

138
0:06:45.254,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is when people can directly, tangibly and emotionally experience

139
0:06:49.422,000 --> 0:06:52,000
some of the future consequences of their actions today.

140
0:06:53.13,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Earlier this year, the government of the United Arab Emirates invited us

141
0:06:57.128,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to help them shape their country's energy strategy

142
0:06:59.598,000 --> 0:07:,000
all the way up to 2050.

143
0:07:01.558,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Based on the government's econometric data, we created this large city model,

144
0:07:05.84,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and visualized many possible futures on it.

145
0:07:10.387,000 --> 0:07:13,000
As I was excitably taking a group of government officials

146
0:07:13.731,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and members of energy companies

147
0:07:15.292,000 --> 0:07:17,000
through one sustainable future on our model,

148
0:07:17.847,000 --> 0:07:18,000
one of the participants told me,

149
0:07:20.122,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"I cannot imagine that in the future people will stop driving cars

150
0:07:23.253,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and start using public transport."

151
0:07:25.916,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And then he said,

152
0:07:27.1,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"There's no way I can tell my own son to stop driving his car."

153
0:07:31.927,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But we were prepared for this reaction.

154
0:07:35.208,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab in my home city in India,

155
0:07:38.569,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we had created approximate samples

156
0:07:40.768,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of what the air would be like in 2030 if our behavior stays the same.

157
0:07:46.493,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And so, I walked the group over to this object

158
0:07:49.91,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that emits vapor from those air samples.

159
0:07:53.494,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Just one whiff of the noxious polluted air from 2030

160
0:07:57.074,000 --> 0:08:,000
brought home the point that no amount of data can.

161
0:08:01.069,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is not the future you would want your children to inherit.

162
0:08:04.62,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The next day, the government made a big announcement.

163
0:08:07.209,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They would be investing billions of dollars in renewables.

164
0:08:10.396,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We don't know what part our future experiences played in this decision,

165
0:08:14.799,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but we know that they've changed their energy policy

166
0:08:17.315,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to mitigate such a scenario.

167
0:08:18.823,000 --> 0:08:21,000
While something like air from the future is very effective and tangible,

168
0:08:22.352,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the trajectory from our present to a future consequence

169
0:08:25.206,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is not always so linear.

170
0:08:27.347,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Even when a technology is developed with utopian ideals,

171
0:08:30.544,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the moment it leaves the laboratory and enters the world,

172
0:08:33.301,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it is subject to forces outside of the creators' control.

173
0:08:37.617,000 --> 0:08:41,000
For one particular project, we investigated medical genomics:

174
0:08:41.875,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the technology of gathering and using people's genetic data

175
0:08:44.99,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to create personalized medicine.

176
0:08:47.268,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We were asking:

177
0:08:48.67,000 --> 0:08:51,000
What are some of the unintended consequences of linking our genetics

178
0:08:52.418,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to health care?

179
0:08:55.175,000 --> 0:08:57,000
To explore this question further,

180
0:08:57.465,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we created a fictional lawsuit,

181
0:08:59.914,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and brought it to life through 31 pieces of carefully crafted evidence.

182
0:09:04.783,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So we built an illegal genetic clinic,

183
0:09:07.895,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,

184
0:09:11.102,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and even bought frozen mice on eBay.

185
0:09:14.273,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So now let's go to that future where this lawsuit is unfolding,

186
0:09:17.452,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.

187
0:09:20.194,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Arnold is being prosecuted by this global giant biotech company

188
0:09:23.783,000 --> 0:09:24,000
called Dynamic Genetics,

189
0:09:25.627,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because they have evidence

190
0:09:27.141,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that Arnold has illegally inserted the company's patented genetic material

191
0:09:31.755,000 --> 0:09:32,000
into his body.

192
0:09:33.273,000 --> 0:09:35,000
How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?

193
0:09:36.853,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Well, it all started

194
0:09:38.051,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when Arnold was asked to submit a saliva sample in this spit kit

195
0:09:42.258,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to the NHI --

196
0:09:43.84,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the UK's National Health Insurance service.

197
0:09:47.289,000 --> 0:09:49,000
When Arnold received his health insurance bill,

198
0:09:50.233,000 --> 0:09:51,000
he was shocked and scared

199
0:09:51.969,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to see that his premiums had gone through the roof,

200
0:09:54.375,000 --> 0:09:56,000
beyond anything he or his family could ever afford.

201
0:09:57.97,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The state's algorithm had scanned his genetic data

202
0:10:00.675,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and found the risk of a chronic health condition lurking in his DNA.

203
0:10:05.135,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And so Arnold had to start paying toward the potential costs

204
0:10:08.523,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of that future disease --

205
0:10:10.223,000 --> 0:10:12,000
potential future disease from today.

206
0:10:12.43,000 --> 0:10:13,000
In that moment of fear and panic,

207
0:10:14.066,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Arnold slipped through the city

208
0:10:15.596,000 --> 0:10:18,000
into the dark shadows of this illegal clinic for treatment --

209
0:10:19.457,000 --> 0:10:21,000
a treatment that would modify his DNA

210
0:10:21.642,000 --> 0:10:24,000
so that the state's algorithm would no longer see him as a risk,

211
0:10:25.324,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and his insurance premiums would become affordable again.

212
0:10:28.325,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But Arnold was caught.

213
0:10:30.034,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the legal proceedings in the case Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.

214
0:10:34.961,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In bringing such a future to life,

215
0:10:36.677,000 --> 0:10:38,000
what was important to us was that people could actually touch,

216
0:10:39.655,000 --> 0:10:4,000
see and feel its potential,

217
0:10:41.757,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because such an immediate and close encounter provokes people

218
0:10:44.776,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to ask the right questions,

219
0:10:46.816,000 --> 0:10:47,000
questions like:

220
0:10:48.111,000 --> 0:10:5,000
What are the implications of living in a world

221
0:10:50.321,000 --> 0:10:51,000
where I'm judged on my genetics?

222
0:10:53.045,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Or: Who might claim ownership to my genetic data,

223
0:10:56.21,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and what might they do with it?

224
0:10:58.918,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If this feels even slightly out-there or farfetched,

225
0:11:02.051,000 --> 0:11:05,000
today there's a little-known bill being passed through the American congress

226
0:11:05.867,000 --> 0:11:09,000
known as HR 1313, Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act.

227
0:11:10.455,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This bill proposes to amend the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act,

228
0:11:14.959,000 --> 0:11:15,000
popularly known as GINA,

229
0:11:16.689,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and would allow employers to ask about family medical history

230
0:11:20.021,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and genetic data

231
0:11:21.229,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to all employees for the first time.

232
0:11:24.938,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Those who refuse would face large penalties.

233
0:11:29.346,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In the work I've shown so far,

234
0:11:31.124,000 --> 0:11:33,000
whether it was drones or genetic crimes,

235
0:11:33.311,000 --> 0:11:35,000
these stories describe troubling futures

236
0:11:35.693,000 --> 0:11:37,000
with the intention of helping us avoid those futures.

237
0:11:39.004,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But what about what we can't avoid?

238
0:11:41.577,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Today, especially with climate change,

239
0:11:43.693,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it looks like we are heading for trouble.

240
0:11:46.151,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And so what we want to do now is to prepare for that future

241
0:11:49.374,000 --> 0:11:53,000
by developing tools and attitudes that can help us find hope --

242
0:11:54.322,000 --> 0:11:55,000
hope that can inspire action.

243
0:11:56.908,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Currently, we are running an experiment in our studio.

244
0:11:59.62,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's a work in progress.

245
0:12:01.539,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Based on climate data projections,

246
0:12:03.787,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we are exploring a future

247
0:12:05.367,000 --> 0:12:08,000
where the Western world has moved from abundance to scarcity.

248
0:12:08.824,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We imagine living in a future city with repeated flooding,

249
0:12:12.259,000 --> 0:12:14,000
periods with almost no food in supermarkets,

250
0:12:15.02,000 --> 0:12:16,000
economic instabilities,

251
0:12:16.78,000 --> 0:12:17,000
broken supply chains.

252
0:12:19.111,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What can we do to not just survive, but prosper in such a world?

253
0:12:24.015,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What food can we eat?

254
0:12:26.163,000 --> 0:12:27,000
To really step inside these questions,

255
0:12:28.006,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we are building this room in a flat in London from 2050.

256
0:12:32.654,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It's like a little time capsule that we reclaimed from the future.

257
0:12:35.994,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We stripped it down to the bare minimum.

258
0:12:38.164,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Everything we lovingly put in our homes,

259
0:12:40.094,000 --> 0:12:41,000
like flat-panel TVs,

260
0:12:41.794,000 --> 0:12:42,000
internet-connected fridges

261
0:12:43.614,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and artisanal furnishings

262
0:12:45.067,000 --> 0:12:46,000
all had to go.

263
0:12:46.413,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And in its place, we're building food computers

264
0:12:49.339,000 --> 0:12:51,000
from abandoned, salvaged and repurposed materials,

265
0:12:52.715,000 --> 0:12:54,000
turning today's waste into tomorrow's dinner.

266
0:12:56.707,000 --> 0:12:57,000
For instance,

267
0:12:57.882,000 --> 0:13:,000
we've just finished building our first fully automated fogponics machine.

268
0:13:01.894,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It uses the technique of fogponics -- so just fog as a nutrient,

269
0:13:05.334,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not even water or soil --

270
0:13:06.937,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to grow things quickly.

271
0:13:09.324,000 --> 0:13:1,000
At the moment,

272
0:13:10.567,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we have successfully grown tomatoes.

273
0:13:13.254,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But we'll need more food than what we can grow in this small room.

274
0:13:16.705,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So what else could we forage from the city?

275
0:13:19.509,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?

276
0:13:25.794,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Earlier, we brought back air from the future.

277
0:13:28.387,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This time we are bringing an entire room from the future,

278
0:13:31.134,000 --> 0:13:33,000
a room full of hope, tools and tactics

279
0:13:33.505,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to create positive action in hostile conditions.

280
0:13:37.384,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Spending time in this room,

281
0:13:38.999,000 --> 0:13:4,000
a room that could be our own future home,

282
0:13:41.086,000 --> 0:13:44,000
makes the consequences of climate change and food insecurity

283
0:13:44.672,000 --> 0:13:46,000
much more immediate and tangible.

284
0:13:49.055,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What we're learning through such experiments and our practice

285
0:13:52.107,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the people we engage with

286
0:13:53.622,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is that creating concrete experiences

287
0:13:55.897,000 --> 0:13:58,000
can bridge the disconnect between today and tomorrow.

288
0:13:59.761,000 --> 0:14:01,000
By putting ourselves into different possible futures,

289
0:14:02.679,000 --> 0:14:03,000
by becoming open and willing

290
0:14:04.265,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort that such an act can bring,

291
0:14:08.629,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we have the opportunity to imagine new possibilities.

292
0:14:12.223,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We can find optimistic futures;

293
0:14:14.151,000 --> 0:14:15,000
we can find paths forward;

294
0:14:16.016,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we can move beyond hope into action.

295
0:14:18.781,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It means we have the chance to change direction,

296
0:14:22.966,000 --> 0:14:24,000
a chance to have our voices heard,

297
0:14:25.832,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a chance to write ourselves into a future we want.

298
0:14:31.548,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Other worlds are possible.

299
0:14:34.469,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thank you.

300
0:14:35.66,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Applause)

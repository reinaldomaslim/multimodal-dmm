1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What looks like moss covering rocks

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is actually a shrub

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
comprised of thousands of branches,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and so densely packed together

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that you could actually stand on top of it.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it happens to be 3,000 years old.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
For the past five years, I've been researching,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
working with biologists

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and traveling all over the world

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to find continuously living organisms

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that are 2,000 years old and older.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The project is part art and part science.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There's an environmental component.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I'm also trying to create a means

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and to start to consider a deeper timescale.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and work backward from there.

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
living on the remote island of Yakushima.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'd been traveling in Japan

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
without an agenda other than to photograph,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then I heard about this tree

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that is 2,180 years old

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and knew that I had to go visit it.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that I got the idea for the project.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So it was the slow churn, if you will.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I think it was my longstanding desire

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to bring together my interest

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in art, science and philosophy

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that allowed me to be ready

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
when the proverbial light bulb went on.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I started researching, and to my surprise,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
this project had never been done before

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the arts or the sciences.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And -- perhaps naively --

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that deals with this idea

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of global species longevity.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So what you're looking at here

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and this is around 3,000 years old

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and lives in Greenland,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which is a long way to go for some lichens.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Visiting Greenland was more like

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
traveling back in time

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than just traveling very far north.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It was very primal and more remote

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
than anything I'd ever experienced before.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
One was when I had been dropped off by boat

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
on a remote fjord,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
were nowhere to be found.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so I was literally left to my own devices.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But luckily, it worked out obviously,

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but it was a humbling experience

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to feel so disconnected.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And then a few days later,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
near our campsite,

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
where the fish were so abundant

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that you could literally reach into the stream

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It was like visiting

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a more innocent time on the planet.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And then, of course, there's the lichens.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
These lichens grow only one centimeter

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
every hundred years.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I think that really puts human lifespans

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
into a different perspective.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And what you're looking at here

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
sounds ominous, it is.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
killing certain species of trees in the forest.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's also more benignly known

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because it happens to be

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
one of the world's largest organisms as well.

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I got some maps and some GPS coordinates

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and chartered a plane

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and started looking for the death rings,

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the circular patterns

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in which the fungus kills the trees.

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but I do know the fungus is down there.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And then this back down on the ground

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So that white material that you see

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in between the bark and the wood

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is the mycelial felt of the fungus,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and what it's doing -- it's actually

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
slowly strangling the tree to death

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So this strategy has served it pretty well --

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it's 2,400 years old.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And then from underground to underwater.

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that's around 2,000 years old.

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is at about 60 feet

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or 18 meters, depth.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that had started eating it,

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of the recent oil spill.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
one of the oldest living things on the planet,

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and the full impact of that disaster

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is still yet to be seen.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now this is something that I think

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is clonal colony

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that is literally 80,000 years old.

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What looks like a forest

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is actually only one tree.

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Imagine that it's one giant root system

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and each tree is a stem

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
coming up from that system.

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So what you have is one giant,

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
interconnected,

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
genetically identical individual

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that's been living for 80,000 years.

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It also happens to be male

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and, in theory immortal.

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is a clonal tree as well.

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is the spruce Gran Picea,

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which at 9,550 years

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
is a mere babe in the woods.

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The location of this tree

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is actually kept secret for its own protection.

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is most likely a product of climate change.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the vegetation zone is actually changing.

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So we don't even necessarily have to have

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
direct contact with these organisms

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to have a very real impact on them.

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is the Fortingall Yew --

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
no, I'm just kidding --

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this is the Fortingall Yew.

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But I put that slide in there

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And aside from coral,

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the answer is no.

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
any guesses?

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Audience: 300.)

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is the oldest living tortoise,

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
so nowhere near 2,000.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And then, you might have heard

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of this giant clam that was discovered

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
off the coast of northern Iceland

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that reached 405 years old.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
However, it died in the lab

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
as they were determining its age.

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The most interesting discovery of late, I think

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is the so-called immortal jellyfish,

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which has actually been observed in the lab

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
after reaching full maturity.

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So that being said,

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And back to the yew here.

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard;

184
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And there are actually a number or ancient yews

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in churchyards around the U.K.,

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but if you do the math, you'll remember

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And now down to another part of the world.

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with an expert in Baobab trees.

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And we saw a number of them,

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and this is most likely the oldest.

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's around 2,000,

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it's called the Sagole Baobab.

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And you know, I think of all of these organisms

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
as palimpsests.

198
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They contain thousands of years

199
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of their own histories within themselves,

200
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and they also contain records of natural and human events.

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And the Baobabs in particular

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
are a great example of this.

203
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You can see that this one

204
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
has names carved into its trunk,

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but it also records some natural events.

206
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So the Baobabs, as they get older,

207
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this can create

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
great natural shelters for animals,

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but they've also been appropriated

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for some rather dubious human uses,

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
including a bar, a prison

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and even a toilet inside of a tree.

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And this brings me to another favorite of mine --

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I think, because it is just so unusual.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This plant is called the Welwitschia,

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,

218
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
where it's uniquely adapted

219
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And what's more, it's actually a tree.

221
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's a primitive conifer.

222
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is actually two single leaves

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that get shredded up

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
by the harsh desert conditions over time.

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And it actually never sheds those leaves,

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so it also bears the distinction

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of having the longest leaves

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the plant kingdom.

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I spoke to a biologist

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to ask him

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
where he thought this remarkable plant came from,

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and his thought was that

236
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
if you travel around Namibia,

237
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you see that there are a number of petrified forests,

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and the logs are all --

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the logs are all giant coniferous trees,

240
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.

241
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So his thought was that

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
flooding in the north of Africa

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
actually brought those coniferous trees down

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
tens of thousands of years ago,

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to this unique desert environment.

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This is something called an underground forest.

249
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,

250
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
who explained that certain species of trees

251
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
have adapted to this region.

252
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's bushfelt region,

253
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,

254
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
as so what these trees have done

255
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,

256
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that this is ground level,

257
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
imagine that the whole thing,

258
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that whole bulk of the tree,

259
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
migrated underground,

260
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.

261
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That way, when a fire roars through,

262
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.

263
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The tree can easily recover.

264
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
These also tend to grow clonally,

265
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.

266
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.

267
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is the clonal Creosote bush,

268
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
which is around 12,000 years old.

269
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you've been in the American West,

270
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,

271
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but that being said, you see that this has

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
this unique, circular form.

273
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
from that original shape.

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system,

276
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
making it one genetically identical individual.

277
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It also has a friend nearby --

278
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
well, I think they're friends.

279
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,

280
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.

281
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And you see it has that similar circular form.

282
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And there's some younger clones

283
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
dotting the landscape behind it.

284
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,

285
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
live on Bureau of Land Management land,

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and that's very different from being protected in a national park.

287
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In fact, this land is designated

288
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So, now I want to show what very well might be

290
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the oldest living thing on the planet.

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is Siberian Actinobacteria,

292
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
which is between 400,000

293
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and 600,000 years old.

294
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This bacteria was discovered several years ago

295
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by a team of planetary biologists

296
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
hoping to find clues to life on other planets

297
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.

298
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,

299
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
was this bacteria.

300
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But what's unique about it is that

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it's doing DNA repair below freezing.

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And what that means is that it's not dormant --

303
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
it's actually been living and growing

304
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
for half a million years.

305
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's also probably one the most vulnerable

306
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of the oldest living things,

307
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because if the permafrost melts,

308
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
it won't survive.

309
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,

310
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.

311
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,

312
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.

313
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.

314
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I'm trying to travel there

315
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to find 5,000 year-old moss,

316
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.

317
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So, I probably have about two more years left

318
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
on this project --

319
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
on this phase of the project,

320
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but after five years,

321
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.

322
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The oldest living things in the world

323
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
are a record and celebration of our past,

324
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
a call to action in the present

325
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and a barometer of our future.

326
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They've survived for millennia

327
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in desert, in the permafrost,

328
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.

329
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They've withstood

330
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
untold natural perils and human encroachments,

331
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but now some of them are in jeopardy,

332
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and they can't just get up and get out of the way.

333
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,

334
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that I can help draw attention

335
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to their remarkable resilience

336
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and help play a part in insuring

337
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.

338
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thank you.

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Applause)

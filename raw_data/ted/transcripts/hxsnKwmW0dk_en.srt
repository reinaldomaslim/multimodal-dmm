1
0:00:14.014,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I think about dreams,

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
like many of you,

3
0:00:17.9,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I think about this picture.

4
0:00:20.838,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

5
0:00:24.899,000 --> 0:00:27,000
step off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon.

6
0:00:29.454,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had never seen anything like it before,

7
0:00:32.708,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I've never seen anything like it since.

8
0:00:36.319,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We got to the Moon for one simple reason:

9
0:00:40.637,000 --> 0:00:43,000
John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

10
0:00:44.978,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And in the absence of that deadline,

11
0:00:47.494,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we would still be dreaming about it.

12
0:00:51.209,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Leonard Bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement:

13
0:00:55.901,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a plan and not quite enough time.

14
0:00:59.39,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:03.851,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Deadlines and commitments

16
0:01:08.369,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are the great and fading lessons of Apollo.

17
0:01:14.514,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And they are what give the word "moonshot" its meaning.

18
0:01:19.498,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And our world is in desperate need of political leaders

19
0:01:24.244,000 --> 0:01:27,000
willing to set bold deadlines

20
0:01:28.053,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again.

21
0:01:34.368,000 --> 0:01:35,000
When I think about dreams,

22
0:01:35.885,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I think about the drag queens of LA and Stonewall

23
0:01:39.958,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and millions of other people risking everything

24
0:01:42.331,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to come out when that was really dangerous,

25
0:01:45.667,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and of this picture of the White House lit up in rainbow colors,

26
0:01:49.412,000 --> 0:01:5,000
yes --

27
0:01:50.594,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Applause) --

28
0:01:56.397,000 --> 0:01:59,000
celebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' right to marry.

29
0:01:59.909,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined

30
0:02:04.18,000 --> 0:02:06,000
when I was 18

31
0:02:06.932,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and figuring out that I was gay

32
0:02:09.956,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and feeling estranged from my country

33
0:02:13.647,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and my dreams because of it.

34
0:02:17.956,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I think about this picture of my family

35
0:02:21.234,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that I never dreamed I could ever have --

36
0:02:25.281,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Applause) --

37
0:02:31.141,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and of our children holding this headline

38
0:02:34.091,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.

39
0:02:40.517,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts.

40
0:02:46.319,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:48.669,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:51.366,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But I want to talk about the need for us to dream

43
0:02:54.732,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in more than one dimension,

44
0:02:56.842,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8,

45
0:03:02.272,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and something about organizing that the rainbow colors over.

46
0:03:07.699,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Of the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,

47
0:03:12.802,000 --> 0:03:15,000
only seven marriages survived.

48
0:03:17.699,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the Moon

49
0:03:21.498,000 --> 0:03:25,000
obscure the alcoholism and depression on Earth.

50
0:03:26.907,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,

51
0:03:29.541,000 --> 0:03:31,000
asked during the time of Apollo,

52
0:03:31.98,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"What can we gain by sailing to the moon

53
0:03:35.92,000 --> 0:03:41,000
if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?"

54
0:03:43.561,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And what can we gain by the right to marry

55
0:03:46.396,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if we are not able to cross the acrimony

56
0:03:49.563,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and emotional distance that so often separates us from our love?

57
0:03:54.596,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And not just in marriage.

58
0:03:57.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,

59
0:04:04.231,000 --> 0:04:08,000
tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS

60
0:04:08.453,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and breast cancer and non-profit activism,

61
0:04:11.873,000 --> 0:04:12,000
all in the name of love.

62
0:04:14.898,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Thomas Merton also wrote about wars among saints

63
0:04:19.639,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and that "there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence

64
0:04:25.692,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to which the idealist most easily succumbs:

65
0:04:30.065,000 --> 0:04:32,000
activism and overwork.

66
0:04:33.414,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace.

67
0:04:38.215,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It destroys our own inner capacity for peace."

68
0:04:44.041,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Too often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations

69
0:04:49.526,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on some future

70
0:04:51.383,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now.

71
0:04:56.926,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Our dreams of a better life for some future humanity

72
0:05:00.665,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or some other humanity in another country

73
0:05:02.949,000 --> 0:05:06,000
alienate us from the beautiful human beings sitting next to us

74
0:05:06.997,000 --> 0:05:07,000
at this very moment.

75
0:05:10.481,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well, that's just the price of progress, we say.

76
0:05:13.664,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You can go to the Moon

77
0:05:15.101,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or you can have stability in your family life.

78
0:05:19.679,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time.

79
0:05:24.012,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we don't set the bar much higher than stability

80
0:05:27.801,000 --> 0:05:29,000
when it comes to our emotional life.

81
0:05:30.579,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Which is why our technology for talking to one another

82
0:05:33.939,000 --> 0:05:35,000
has gone vertical,

83
0:05:36.332,000 --> 0:05:39,000
our ability to listen and understand one another

84
0:05:40.062,000 --> 0:05:41,000
has gone nowhere.

85
0:05:43.236,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Our access to information is through the roof,

86
0:05:47.665,000 --> 0:05:5,000
our access to joy, grounded.

87
0:05:53.442,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But this idea, that our present and our future are mutually exclusive,

88
0:05:59.338,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender

89
0:06:03.358,000 --> 0:06:06,000
our profound potential for being,

90
0:06:06.545,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,

91
0:06:10.48,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love

92
0:06:14.806,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is somehow limited

93
0:06:16.908,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is a false and suffocating choice.

94
0:06:22.237,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now, I'm not suggesting

95
0:06:24.073,000 --> 0:06:29,000
simply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance.

96
0:06:31.541,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home

97
0:06:34.478,000 --> 0:06:36,000
if my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it?

98
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.

99
0:06:40.589,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.

100
0:06:45.973,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:48.314,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Right?

102
0:06:49.49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I'm talking about dreaming

103
0:06:52.458,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as boldly in the dimension of our being

104
0:06:57.243,000 --> 0:06:59,000
as we do about industry and technology.

105
0:06:59.751,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I'm talking about an audacious authenticity

106
0:07:04.536,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that allows us to cry with one another,

107
0:07:08.298,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real.

108
0:07:13.85,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It is our inability to be with one another,

109
0:07:16.399,000 --> 0:07:2,000
our fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many

110
0:07:20.757,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place,

111
0:07:24.075,000 --> 0:07:27,000
from Congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity.

112
0:07:28.097,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Applause)

113
0:07:31.388,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B,

114
0:07:35.459,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about

115
0:07:41.094,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and scientific about the development of our humanity

116
0:07:45.127,000 --> 0:07:47,000
as we are about the development of our technology.

117
0:07:49.341,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We should not shrink from this opportunity

118
0:07:51.826,000 --> 0:07:53,000
simply because we don't really understand it.

119
0:07:55.357,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There was a time when we didn't understand space.

120
0:07:58.722,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Or because we're more used to technology and activism.

121
0:08:02.174,000 --> 0:08:05,000
That is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone.

122
0:08:05.469,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement.

123
0:08:11.842,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself

124
0:08:16.017,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that cries out for its fair share of our imagination.

125
0:08:23.782,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, we're all here to dream,

126
0:08:26.131,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but maybe if we're honest about it,

127
0:08:27.823,000 --> 0:08:29,000
each of us chasing our own dream.

128
0:08:30.536,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream,

129
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
sometimes looking right through one another's humanity.

130
0:08:37.45,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I can't be bothered with you right now. I have an idea for saving the world.

131
0:08:41.513,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Right?

132
0:08:42.689,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

133
0:08:45.83,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Years ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company

134
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement.

135
0:08:54.647,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And we had this mantra:

136
0:08:56.718,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Human. Kind. Be Both."

137
0:09:01.139,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness.

138
0:09:07.599,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Like, "Go help everybody set up their tents."

139
0:09:11.4,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And there were a lot of tents.

140
0:09:13.995,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

141
0:09:16.043,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"Go buy everybody Popsicles."

142
0:09:17.79,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Go help people fix their flat tires

143
0:09:19.695,000 --> 0:09:21,000
even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer."

144
0:09:22.645,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And people really took us up on this,

145
0:09:25.043,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride,

146
0:09:27.694,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you

147
0:09:31.345,000 --> 0:09:32,000
if you needed help.

148
0:09:33.345,000 --> 0:09:37,000
For a few days, for tens of thousands of people,

149
0:09:37.378,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we created these worlds

150
0:09:39.316,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be.

151
0:09:46.316,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What if we experimented with creating that kind of world

152
0:09:50.847,000 --> 0:09:51,000
these next few days?

153
0:09:54.156,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And instead of going up to someone and asking them, "What do you do?"

154
0:09:59.195,000 --> 0:10:01,000
ask them, "So what are your dreams?"

155
0:10:02.315,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or "What are your broken dreams?"

156
0:10:05.346,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams.

157
0:10:10.83,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

158
0:10:15.623,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"

159
0:10:18.203,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or "I want to build a tree house with my kid."

160
0:10:21.512,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet,

161
0:10:24.728,000 --> 0:10:25,000
go up to the person who is all alone

162
0:10:26.509,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.

163
0:10:30.544,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I think what we fear most

164
0:10:33.044,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential,

165
0:10:37.424,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that we are born to dream

166
0:10:40.059,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and we might die without ever having the chance.

167
0:10:45.63,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Imagine living in a world

168
0:10:47.282,000 --> 0:10:53,000
where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another

169
0:10:53.503,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and love one another boldly because we know

170
0:10:56.659,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that to be human is to live with that fear.

171
0:11:01.793,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously,

172
0:11:08.262,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things

173
0:11:12.254,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we can and will and must do

174
0:11:16.881,000 --> 0:11:21,000
lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.

175
0:11:23.748,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's time we set foot into that dimension

176
0:11:27.23,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too.

177
0:11:33.214,000 --> 0:11:35,000
If the Moon could dream,

178
0:11:38.039,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I think that would be its dream for us.

179
0:11:43.54,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's an honor to be with you.

180
0:11:45.203,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you very much.

181
0:11:47.136,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Applause)

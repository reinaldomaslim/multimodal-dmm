2
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I had this very interesting experience

3
0:00:16.111,000 --> 0:00:17,000
five years ago.

4
0:00:18.278,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You know, me and my husband, we were out grocery shopping,

5
0:00:21.127,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as we do every other day,

6
0:00:22.744,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but this time, we found this fancy,

7
0:00:26.117,000 --> 0:00:29,000
you know, I'm talking fair-trade, I'm talking organic,

8
0:00:29.863,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm talking Kenyan, single-origin coffee

9
0:00:32.419,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that we splurged and got.

10
0:00:35.252,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And that was when the problem started already.

11
0:00:38.578,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You know, my husband, he deemed this coffee blend superior

12
0:00:42.442,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to our regular and much cheaper coffee,

13
0:00:44.855,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which made me imagine a life based solely on fancy coffee

14
0:00:49.228,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I saw our household budget explode.

15
0:00:51.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:52.705,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And worse ...

17
0:00:55.038,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I also feared that this investment would be in vain.

18
0:00:58.164,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That we wouldn't be able to notice this difference after all.

19
0:01:03.355,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Unfortunately, especially for my husband,

20
0:01:07.212,000 --> 0:01:1,000
he had momentarily forgotten that he's married to a neuroscientist

21
0:01:10.356,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with a specialty in food science.

22
0:01:12.165,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:13.363,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Alright?

24
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So without further ado,

25
0:01:16.211,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I mean, I just put him to the test.

26
0:01:19.126,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I set up an experiment

27
0:01:21.111,000 --> 0:01:23,000
where I first blindfolded my husband.

28
0:01:24.475,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:25.65,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Then I brewed the two types of coffee

30
0:01:29.125,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I told him that I would serve them to him

31
0:01:31.729,000 --> 0:01:32,000
one at a time.

32
0:01:34.387,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now, with clear certainty,

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
my husband, he described the first cup of coffee

34
0:01:38.702,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as more raw and bitter.

35
0:01:40.022,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You know, a coffee that would be ideal for the mornings

36
0:01:42.776,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with the sole purpose of terrorizing the body awake by its alarming taste.

37
0:01:46.771,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:48.898,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The second cup of coffee, on the other hand,

39
0:01:51.786,000 --> 0:01:54,000
was both fruity and delightful.

40
0:01:55.601,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You know, coffee that one can enjoy in the evening and relax.

41
0:02:01.466,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Little did my husband know, however,

42
0:02:04.323,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that I hadn't actually given him the two types of coffee.

43
0:02:07.672,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I had given him the exact same cup of coffee twice.

44
0:02:10.834,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:13.358,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And obviously, it wasn't this one cup of coffee

46
0:02:16.016,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that had suddenly gone from horrible to fantastic.

47
0:02:19.27,000 --> 0:02:22,000
No, this taste difference was a product of my husband's own mind.

48
0:02:23.521,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Of his bias in favor of the fancy coffee

49
0:02:26.552,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that made him experience taste differences that just weren't there.

50
0:02:31.64,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Alright, so, having saved our household budget,

51
0:02:36.365,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and finishing on a very good laugh,

52
0:02:38.072,000 --> 0:02:39,000
me especially --

53
0:02:39.271,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:40.302,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I then started wondering just how we could have received

55
0:02:43.292,000 --> 0:02:46,000
two such different responses from a single cup of coffee.

56
0:02:47.331,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Why would my husband make such a bold statement

57
0:02:51.046,000 --> 0:02:55,000
at the risk of being publicly mocked for the rest of his life?

58
0:02:55.517,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:58.831,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The striking answer is that I think you would have done the same.

60
0:03:03.196,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And that's the biggest challenge in my field of science,

61
0:03:06.466,000 --> 0:03:09,000
assessing what's reality behind these answers

62
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that we receive.

63
0:03:10.99,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because how are we going to make food tastier

64
0:03:13.825,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if we cannot rely on what people actually say they like?

65
0:03:18.728,000 --> 0:03:21,000
To understand, let's first have a look at how we actually sense food.

66
0:03:22.923,000 --> 0:03:24,000
When I drink a cup of coffee,

67
0:03:25.265,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I detect this cup of coffee by receptors on my body,

68
0:03:29.431,000 --> 0:03:33,000
information which is then turned into activated neurons in my brain.

69
0:03:34.57,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Wavelengths of light are converted to colors.

70
0:03:37.324,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Molecules in the liquid are detected by receptors in my mouth,

71
0:03:41.483,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and categorized as one of five basic tastes.

72
0:03:45.266,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami.

73
0:03:50.433,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Molecules in the air are detected by receptors in my nose

74
0:03:53.758,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and converted to odors.

75
0:03:55.704,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And ditto for touch, for temperature, for sound and more.

76
0:04:00.394,000 --> 0:04:03,000
All this information is detected by my receptors

77
0:04:04.276,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and converted into signals between neurons in my brain.

78
0:04:07.569,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Information which is then woven together and integrated,

79
0:04:12.48,000 --> 0:04:14,000
so that my brain recognizes

80
0:04:15.355,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that yes, I just had a cup of coffee, and yes, I liked it.

81
0:04:21.763,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And only then,

82
0:04:23.763,000 --> 0:04:25,000
after all this neuron heavy lifting,

83
0:04:26.771,000 --> 0:04:29,000
do we consciously experience this cup of coffee.

84
0:04:30.988,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And this is now where we have a very common misconception.

85
0:04:35.473,000 --> 0:04:38,000
People tend to think that what we experience consciously

86
0:04:39.028,000 --> 0:04:42,000
must then be an absolute true reflection of reality.

87
0:04:42.588,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But as you just heard,

88
0:04:44.326,000 --> 0:04:47,000
there are many stages of neural interpretation

89
0:04:47.866,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in between the physical item and the conscious experience of it.

90
0:04:52.395,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Which means that sometimes,

91
0:04:54.538,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this conscious experience is not really reflecting that reality at all.

92
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:,000
Like what happened to my husband.

93
0:05:01.808,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's because some physical stimuli may just be so weak

94
0:05:05.974,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that they just can't break that barrier to enter our conscious mind,

95
0:05:10.371,000 --> 0:05:11,000
while the information that does

96
0:05:12.277,000 --> 0:05:16,000
may get twisted on its way there by our hidden biases.

97
0:05:16.824,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And people, they have a lot of biases.

98
0:05:23.649,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Yes, if you're sitting there right now, thinking ...

99
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:3,000
you could probably have done better than my husband,

100
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you could probably have assessed those coffees correctly,

101
0:05:34.371,000 --> 0:05:36,000
then you're actually suffering from a bias.

102
0:05:38.116,000 --> 0:05:4,000
A bias called the bias blind spot.

103
0:05:40.609,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Our tendency to see ourselves as less biased than other people.

104
0:05:45.717,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:46.931,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And yeah, we can even be biased

106
0:05:48.448,000 --> 0:05:49,000
about the biases that we're biased about.

107
0:05:50.439,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:51.464,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Not trying to make this any easier.

109
0:05:54.27,000 --> 0:05:58,000
A bias that we know in the food industry is the courtesy bias.

110
0:05:59.619,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is a bias where we give an opinion

111
0:06:02.056,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which is considered socially acceptable,

112
0:06:05.735,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but it's certainly not our own opinion, right?

113
0:06:09.575,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I'm challenged by this as a food researcher,

114
0:06:12.154,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because when people say they like my new sugar-reduced milkshake,

115
0:06:17.276,000 --> 0:06:18,000
do they now?

116
0:06:18.482,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:19.561,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Or are they saying they like it

118
0:06:21.934,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because they know I'm listening and they want to please me?

119
0:06:25.544,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Or maybe they just to seem fit and healthy in my ears.

120
0:06:30.115,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I wouldn't know.

121
0:06:31.742,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But worse, they wouldn't even know themselves.

122
0:06:37.348,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Even trained food assessors,

123
0:06:38.729,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and that's people who have been explicitly taught

124
0:06:41.324,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to disentangle the sense of smell and the sense of taste,

125
0:06:45.475,000 --> 0:06:48,000
may still be biased to evaluate products sweeter

126
0:06:48.606,000 --> 0:06:49,000
if they contain vanilla.

127
0:06:50.455,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Why?

128
0:06:51.978,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Well, it's certainly not because vanilla actually tastes sweet.

129
0:06:56.51,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's because even these professionals are human,

130
0:07:00.49,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and have eaten lot of desserts, like us,

131
0:07:03.744,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and have therefore learned to associate sweetness and vanilla.

132
0:07:08.056,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So taste and smell and other sensory information

133
0:07:11.397,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is inextricably entangled in our conscious mind.

134
0:07:14.508,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So on one hand, we can actually use this.

135
0:07:17.458,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We can use these conscious experiences,

136
0:07:19.951,000 --> 0:07:23,000
use this data, exploit it by adding vanilla instead of sugar

137
0:07:24.244,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to sweeten our products.

138
0:07:26.823,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But on the other hand,

139
0:07:29.173,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with these conscious evaluations,

140
0:07:30.784,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I still wouldn't know

141
0:07:32.006,000 --> 0:07:34,000
whether people actually liked that sugar-reduced milkshake.

142
0:07:36.006,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So how do we get around this problem?

143
0:07:37.815,000 --> 0:07:39,000
How do we actually assess what's reality

144
0:07:40.101,000 --> 0:07:42,000
behind these conscious food evaluations?

145
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The key is to remove the barrier of the conscious mind

146
0:07:46.959,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and instead target the information in the brain directly.

147
0:07:51.015,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And it turns out

148
0:07:52.34,000 --> 0:07:55,000
our brain holds a lot of fascinating secrets.

149
0:07:55.872,000 --> 0:08:,000
Our brain constantly receives sensory information from our entire body,

150
0:08:00.964,000 --> 0:08:02,000
most of which we don't even become aware of,

151
0:08:03.345,000 --> 0:08:05,000
like the taste information that I constantly receive

152
0:08:06.289,000 --> 0:08:07,000
from my gastrointestinal tract.

153
0:08:08.647,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And my brain will also act on all this sensory information.

154
0:08:13.274,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It will alter my behavior without my knowledge,

155
0:08:16.734,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and it can increase the diameter of my pupils

156
0:08:20.014,000 --> 0:08:21,000
if I experience something I really like.

157
0:08:22.355,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And increase my sweat production ever so slightly

158
0:08:25.434,000 --> 0:08:26,000
if that emotion was intense.

159
0:08:28.3,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And with brain scans,

160
0:08:30.014,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we can now assess this information in the brain.

161
0:08:34.021,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Specifically, I have used a brain-scanning technique

162
0:08:36.493,000 --> 0:08:38,000
called electroencephalography,

163
0:08:38.87,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or "EEG" in short,

164
0:08:40.727,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which involves wearing a cap studded with electrodes,

165
0:08:44.696,000 --> 0:08:46,000
128 in my case.

166
0:08:47.957,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Each electrode then measures the electrical activity of the brain

167
0:08:51.592,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with precision down to the millisecond.

168
0:08:55.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The problem is, however,

169
0:08:57.704,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it's not just the brain that's electrically active,

170
0:09:00.157,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it's also the rest of the body as well as the environment

171
0:09:02.919,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that contains a lot of electrical activity all the time.

172
0:09:05.657,000 --> 0:09:06,000
To do my research,

173
0:09:07.069,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I therefore need to minimize all this noise.

174
0:09:10.411,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So I ask my participants to do a number of things here.

175
0:09:14.427,000 --> 0:09:15,000
First off,

176
0:09:15.61,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I ask them to rest their head in a chin rest,

177
0:09:18.939,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to avoid too much muscle movement.

178
0:09:21.384,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I also ask them to, meanwhile, stare at the center of a computer monitor

179
0:09:25.403,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to avoid too much eye movements and eye blinks.

180
0:09:28.196,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I can't even have swallowing,

181
0:09:30.728,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so I ask my participants to stick the tongue out of their mouth

182
0:09:35.344,000 --> 0:09:37,000
over a glass bowl,

183
0:09:37.376,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and then I constantly let taste stimuli onto the tongue,

184
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which then drip off into this bowl.

185
0:09:43.728,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:45.236,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And then, just to complete this wonderful picture,

187
0:09:49.403,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I also provide my participants with a bib,

188
0:09:52.014,000 --> 0:09:55,000
available in either pink or blue, as they please.

189
0:09:55.141,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:59.252,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Looks like a normal eating experience, right?

191
0:10:01.39,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

192
0:10:03.585,000 --> 0:10:04,000
No, obviously not.

193
0:10:06.546,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And worse,

194
0:10:07.919,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I can't even control what my participants are thinking about,

195
0:10:11.284,000 --> 0:10:13,000
so I need to repeat this taste procedure

196
0:10:13.419,000 --> 0:10:14,000
multiple times.

197
0:10:14.958,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Maybe the first time, they're thinking about the free lunch

198
0:10:17.813,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that I provide for participating,

199
0:10:19.998,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or maybe the second time, they're thinking about Christmas coming up

200
0:10:23.32,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and what to get for Mom this year, you know.

201
0:10:27.109,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But common for each response is the response to the taste.

202
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So I repeat this taste procedure multiple times.

203
0:10:34.871,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Sixty, in fact.

204
0:10:37.291,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And then I average the responses,

205
0:10:38.935,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because responses unrelated to taste will average out.

206
0:10:42.307,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And using this method,

207
0:10:43.982,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we and other labs,

208
0:10:46.53,000 --> 0:10:49,000
have investigated how long a time it takes from "food lands on our tongue"

209
0:10:50.057,000 --> 0:10:52,000
until our brain has figured out which taste it's experiencing.

210
0:10:53.639,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Turns out this occurs within the first already 100 milliseconds,

211
0:10:56.877,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that's about half a second before we even become aware of it.

212
0:11:00.268,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And next up, we also investigated

213
0:11:02.104,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the taste difference between sugar and artificial sweeteners

214
0:11:05.927,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that in our setup taste extremely similar.

215
0:11:08.563,000 --> 0:11:1,000
In fact, they tasted so similar

216
0:11:10.618,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that half my participants could only barely tell the taste apart,

217
0:11:14.221,000 --> 0:11:16,000
while the other half simply couldn't.

218
0:11:17.015,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But amazingly,

219
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:21,000
if we looked across the entire group of participants,

220
0:11:21.95,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we saw that their brains definitely could tell the taste apart.

221
0:11:26.895,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So with EEG and other brain-scanning devices

222
0:11:29.778,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and other physiological measures --

223
0:11:31.962,000 --> 0:11:32,000
sweat and pupil size --

224
0:11:33.157,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we have new gateways to our brain.

225
0:11:35.625,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Gateways that will help us remove the barrier of the conscious mind

226
0:11:39.34,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to see through the biases of people

227
0:11:41.547,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and possibly even capture subconscious taste differences.

228
0:11:44.689,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And that's because we can now measure people's very first response to food

229
0:11:49.024,000 --> 0:11:5,000
before they've become conscious of it,

230
0:11:50.865,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and before they've started rationalizing why they like it or not.

231
0:11:54.476,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We can measure people's facial expressions,

232
0:11:56.675,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we can measure where they're looking,

233
0:11:59.196,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we can measure their sweat response,

234
0:12:01.22,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we can measure their brain response.

235
0:12:04.03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And with all these measures,

236
0:12:06.117,000 --> 0:12:08,000
we are going to be able to create tastier foods,

237
0:12:08.479,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because we can measure whether people actually like

238
0:12:10.9,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that sugar-reduced milkshake.

239
0:12:12.661,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And we can create healthier foods without compromising taste,

240
0:12:16.788,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because we can measure the response to different sweeteners

241
0:12:19.585,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and find the sweetener that gives the response that's more similar

242
0:12:22.712,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to the response from sugar.

243
0:12:24.029,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And furthermore, we can just help create healthier foods,

244
0:12:26.728,000 --> 0:12:28,000
because we can help understand how we actually sense food

245
0:12:29.719,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the first place.

246
0:12:31.533,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Which we know surprisingly little about.

247
0:12:34.589,000 --> 0:12:37,000
For example, we know that there are those five basic tastes,

248
0:12:37.944,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but we strongly suspect that there are more,

249
0:12:40.211,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and in fact, using our EEG setup, we found evidence that fat,

250
0:12:45.212,000 --> 0:12:47,000
besides being sensed by its texture and smell,

251
0:12:47.823,000 --> 0:12:48,000
is also tasted.

252
0:12:49.553,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Meaning that fat could be this new sixth basic taste.

253
0:12:53.522,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And if we figure out how our brain recognizes fat and sugar,

254
0:12:57.903,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and I'm just dreaming here,

255
0:12:59.244,000 --> 0:13:,000
but could we then one day

256
0:13:00.76,000 --> 0:13:04,000
create a milkshake with zero calories that tastes just like the real deal?

257
0:13:06.894,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Or maybe we figure out that we can't,

258
0:13:09.196,000 --> 0:13:11,000
because we subconsciously detect calories

259
0:13:11.79,000 --> 0:13:13,000
via our receptors in our gastrointestinal tract.

260
0:13:15.137,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The future will show.

261
0:13:17.978,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Our conscious experience of food

262
0:13:20.827,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is just the tip of the iceberg of our total sensation of food.

263
0:13:25.815,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And by studying this total sensation,

264
0:13:28.146,000 --> 0:13:3,000
conscious and subconscious alike,

265
0:13:31.046,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I truly believe that we can make tastier and healthier foods for all.

266
0:13:35.579,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

267
0:13:36.754,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Applause)

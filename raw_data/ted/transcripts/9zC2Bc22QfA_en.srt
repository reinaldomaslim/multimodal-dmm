2
0:00:13.627,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was a fantastic new pink suit

3
0:00:17.683,000 --> 0:00:19,000
with big buttons and shoulder pads.

4
0:00:21.476,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It was 1997,

5
0:00:23.411,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I was the new boss of Griffin's Foods,

6
0:00:26.045,000 --> 0:00:29,000
an iconic cookie and snacks company in New Zealand.

7
0:00:30.148,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was my first time as the leader of a company,

8
0:00:32.863,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I was on the stage to give a big speech

9
0:00:35.427,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about our ambitious new goals.

10
0:00:38.83,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I knew exactly what my call to action was,

11
0:00:41.338,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which was "One in every four times a Kiwi eats a snack,

12
0:00:44.83,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it will be one of ours."

13
0:00:47.266,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I emphasized that we knew how to measure our results

14
0:00:50.339,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and that our future was in our control.

15
0:00:54.448,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Embarrassingly enough,

16
0:00:55.679,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I finished up with "If not this, what?

17
0:00:58.416,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If not us, who?

18
0:00:59.654,000 --> 0:01:,000
And if not now, when?"

19
0:01:03.231,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I got this huge round of applause

20
0:01:04.883,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I was really, really pleased with myself.

21
0:01:09.279,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I wanted so much to be a good leader.

22
0:01:12.474,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I wanted to be followed by a devoted team,

23
0:01:15.593,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I wanted to be right.

24
0:01:17.823,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In short, I wanted to be a hero.

25
0:01:21.165,000 --> 0:01:24,000
A hero selling chips and biscuits in a pink suit.

26
0:01:25.125,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.403,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What happened after that speech?

28
0:01:31.419,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Nothing.

29
0:01:33.561,000 --> 0:01:35,000
All of that applause did not lead to action.

30
0:01:36.475,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Nothing changed.

31
0:01:38.021,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Not because they didn't like me or the message.

32
0:01:40.997,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do.

33
0:01:44.561,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And most importantly,

34
0:01:45.989,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they didn't know that I needed them.

35
0:01:49.141,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, you may think that this is a classic hero speech,

36
0:01:51.696,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where I'm going to tell you that I overcame that obstacle and triumphed.

37
0:01:55.736,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Actually, I'm going to tell you

38
0:01:58.077,000 --> 0:02:,000
that in a world as complex and interconnected

39
0:02:00.671,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as the one we live in,

40
0:02:02.306,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the idea that one person has the answer is ludicrous.

41
0:02:06.624,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It's not only ineffective, it's dangerous,

42
0:02:10.084,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because it leads us to believe that it's been solved by that hero,

43
0:02:14.188,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we have no role.

44
0:02:17.323,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We don't need heroes.

45
0:02:18.887,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We need radical interdependence,

46
0:02:21.363,000 --> 0:02:23,000
which is just another way of saying we need each other.

47
0:02:24.792,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Even though other people can be really difficult, sometimes.

48
0:02:30.334,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I spent decades trying to work out how to be a good leader.

49
0:02:33.953,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I've lived in seven countries and five continents.

50
0:02:37.458,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And in recent years,

51
0:02:38.807,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I've spent a lot of time with the B Corp community,

52
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
originally as a corporate participant

53
0:02:43.847,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and more recently as an ambassador.

54
0:02:47.403,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, B Corps are a group of companies

55
0:02:49.196,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who believe in business as a force for good.

56
0:02:52.649,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There's a tough certification with about 250 questions

57
0:02:56.419,000 --> 0:02:59,000
about your social and environmental performance.

58
0:03:00.069,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You must legally declare your intention

59
0:03:02.45,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to serve the community as well as your shareholders

60
0:03:05.434,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and you must sign the declaration of interdependence.

61
0:03:10.427,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now one of the things that inspires me the most

62
0:03:12.927,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about the companies in this movement

63
0:03:14.993,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is that they see themselves as part of a whole system.

64
0:03:19.024,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's sort of as if they imagine themselves on a big, flowing river of activity,

65
0:03:24.556,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where, if they are, for example, soft drinks manufacturers,

66
0:03:29.244,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they understand that upstream from them,

67
0:03:32.395,000 --> 0:03:34,000
there's water and sugar,

68
0:03:35.395,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and farmers that grow that sugar,

69
0:03:37.664,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and plastic and metal and glass,

70
0:03:40.759,000 --> 0:03:42,000
all of which flows into this thing

71
0:03:43.683,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that we call a company which has financial results.

72
0:03:47.252,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And the flowing continues with consequences.

73
0:03:51.268,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Some of them intended,

74
0:03:52.776,000 --> 0:03:54,000
like refreshment and hydration,

75
0:03:55.738,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and some unintended,

76
0:03:57.492,000 --> 0:03:59,000
like garbage and obesity.

77
0:04:01.492,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Spending time with leaders in this space

78
0:04:03.452,000 --> 0:04:07,000
has led me to see that true collaboration is possible,

79
0:04:07.739,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but it's subtle and it's complex.

80
0:04:10.397,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently

81
0:04:13.984,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from traditional heroic leaders.

82
0:04:17.125,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They set goals differently,

83
0:04:19.403,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they announce those goals differently

84
0:04:21.807,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they have a very different relationship with other people.

85
0:04:25.593,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Let's begin with the first difference.

86
0:04:28.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A hero sets a goal that can be individually delivered

87
0:04:33.426,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and neatly measured.

88
0:04:35.815,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You can recognize a heroic goal --

89
0:04:37.665,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they use terms like "revenue" and "market share"

90
0:04:40.707,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and are often competitive.

91
0:04:42.636,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I mean, remember pink-suit day?

92
0:04:46.39,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

93
0:04:48.414,000 --> 0:04:5,000
start with a goal that's really important,

94
0:04:50.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but is actually impossible to achieve by one company or one person alone.

95
0:04:57.228,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I want to give you an example from the clothing industry,

96
0:04:59.919,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which produces 92 million tons of waste a year.

97
0:05:04.744,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Patagonia and Eileen Fisher are clothing manufacturers,

98
0:05:08.815,000 --> 0:05:09,000
both of them B Corps,

99
0:05:10.538,000 --> 0:05:13,000
both of them deeply committed to reducing waste.

100
0:05:14.637,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They don't see that their responsibility ends

101
0:05:18.43,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when a customer buys their clothes.

102
0:05:21.034,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Patagonia encourages you not to buy new clothes from them,

103
0:05:24.964,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and will repair your old clothes for free.

104
0:05:27.979,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Eileen Fisher will pay you when you bring back your clothes,

105
0:05:31.622,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and either sell them on or turn them into other clothes.

106
0:05:36.276,000 --> 0:05:39,000
While these two companies are competitive in some ways,

107
0:05:39.665,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they work together and with others in the industry

108
0:05:42.252,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to solve shared problems.

109
0:05:45.149,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They take responsibility for things that happen upstream as well.

110
0:05:49.395,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Around the world,

111
0:05:50.585,000 --> 0:05:54,000
there are around 300 million people who work from home in this industry,

112
0:05:55.276,000 --> 0:05:56,000
most of them women,

113
0:05:56.879,000 --> 0:05:58,000
many of them in very difficult circumstances

114
0:05:59.704,000 --> 0:06:,000
with poor lighting,

115
0:06:01.276,000 --> 0:06:04,000
sewing on buttons and doing detailed stitching.

116
0:06:05.117,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Until 2014, there was no protection for these workers.

117
0:06:10.101,000 --> 0:06:14,000
A group of companies got together with a not-for-profit called Nest

118
0:06:14.236,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to create a set of standards

119
0:06:16.061,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that's now been adopted by the whole industry.

120
0:06:19.681,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Once you've seen problems like this, you can't unsee them,

121
0:06:23.618,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so you have to ask others to help you to solve them.

122
0:06:26.507,000 --> 0:06:28,000
These folks take interdependence as a given,

123
0:06:29.002,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and said to me,

124
0:06:30.609,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"We don't compete on human rights."

125
0:06:34.236,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The second big difference for collaborators

126
0:06:36.919,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan.

127
0:06:41.965,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now the hero only reveals their carefully crafted goal

128
0:06:46.521,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when the path to achieve it is clear.

129
0:06:48.989,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In fact, the role of the hero announcement is to set the stage for the big win.

130
0:06:54.252,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Hero announcements are full of triumph.

131
0:06:58.112,000 --> 0:07:,000
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

132
0:07:01.12,000 --> 0:07:02,000
want other people to help them,

133
0:07:02.962,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so their announcements are often an invitation for co-creation,

134
0:07:07.982,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and sometimes, they're a call for help.

135
0:07:11.911,000 --> 0:07:14,000
At the North American division of the French food company Danone,

136
0:07:15.331,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I announced that we wanted to become a B Corp.

137
0:07:18.847,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And unlike pink-suit day,

138
0:07:20.522,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I had no plan to get there.

139
0:07:24.069,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I remember the day really clearly.

140
0:07:26.538,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Everybody in the room gasped,

141
0:07:28.879,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because they knew we didn't have a plan.

142
0:07:32.478,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But they also knew that we had seen our role

143
0:07:37.046,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in the river that is the food system,

144
0:07:39.982,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and we wanted to make a change.

145
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Making that declaration without a plan

146
0:07:45.619,000 --> 0:07:47,000
meant that so many young people in our company

147
0:07:48.342,000 --> 0:07:49,000
stepped up to help us,

148
0:07:50.318,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and B Corps around us all rallied around.

149
0:07:54.556,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And the day we became a B Corp

150
0:07:56.458,000 --> 0:08:,000
wasn't just a self-congratulatory moment of a hero company --

151
0:08:00.934,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it was more like a community celebration.

152
0:08:05.748,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now when you gave goals that you can't achieve alone,

153
0:08:09.184,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you've told everyone about them,

154
0:08:11.74,000 --> 0:08:15,000
inevitably, you'll end up at the third big difference,

155
0:08:16.165,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which is how you see other people,

156
0:08:18.284,000 --> 0:08:2,000
inside your company and outside.

157
0:08:22.998,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Heroes see everyone as a competitor or a follower.

158
0:08:28.736,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Heroes don't want input,

159
0:08:30.712,000 --> 0:08:33,000
because they want to control everything because they want the credit.

160
0:08:34.673,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And you can see this in a typical hero meeting.

161
0:08:38.617,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Heroes like making speeches.

162
0:08:41.752,000 --> 0:08:44,000
People lean back in their chairs,

163
0:08:44.99,000 --> 0:08:46,000
maybe impressed but not engaged.

164
0:08:48.911,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

165
0:08:50.95,000 --> 0:08:52,000
understand that they need other people.

166
0:08:53.461,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They know that meetings are not just mindless calendar fillers.

167
0:08:57.366,000 --> 0:08:59,000
These are the most precious things you have.

168
0:08:59.866,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's where people collaborate and communicate

169
0:09:02.381,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and share ideas.

170
0:09:04.458,000 --> 0:09:06,000
People lean forward in meetings like this,

171
0:09:07.339,000 --> 0:09:09,000
wondering where they might fit in.

172
0:09:12.482,000 --> 0:09:14,000
When I was in Shanghai in China,

173
0:09:14.569,000 --> 0:09:17,000
where I lived for six years, running the Kraft Foods business,

174
0:09:17.886,000 --> 0:09:2,000
selling, amongst other things, Oreo cookies,

175
0:09:21.624,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we had a problem with hero culture.

176
0:09:25.337,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We kept on launching new products that failed.

177
0:09:28.083,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And we would find out afterwards

178
0:09:29.655,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that everyone in the company knew they were going to fail,

179
0:09:32.424,000 --> 0:09:33,000
they just didn't feel free to tell us.

180
0:09:34.268,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings

181
0:09:38.403,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in two important ways.

182
0:09:39.958,000 --> 0:09:42,000
First of all, language went back to Chinese.

183
0:09:43.351,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Because even though everyone spoke great English,

184
0:09:46.446,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when I was in the room and the meeting was in English,

185
0:09:49.05,000 --> 0:09:5,000
they focused on me.

186
0:09:50.238,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I was the foreigner, and I was the boss

187
0:09:52.335,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I apparently had that intimidating hero look.

188
0:09:56.321,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The second thing

189
0:09:57.63,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is we asked every single person in the meeting their opinion.

190
0:10:02.765,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And our understanding of the subtleties of the differences

191
0:10:06.11,000 --> 0:10:09,000
between American taste and Chinese taste, in this case,

192
0:10:09.887,000 --> 0:10:1,000
really improved,

193
0:10:11.49,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and our new product success rate radically turned around

194
0:10:14.448,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and we launched a lot of winners,

195
0:10:16.377,000 --> 0:10:19,000
including the now famous green-tea-flavored Oreos.

196
0:10:22.07,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Hero culture sneaks in everywhere.

197
0:10:24.943,000 --> 0:10:27,000
At Danone, we had a lot of great stuff happening

198
0:10:28.03,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in one part of the world,

199
0:10:29.878,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and we wanted it to spread to another part of the world.

200
0:10:33.482,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But when you put a person in business gear

201
0:10:36.082,000 --> 0:10:38,000
up in front of a group of people with PowerPoint,

202
0:10:39.01,000 --> 0:10:42,000
they have the urge to become sort of heroic.

203
0:10:42.549,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And they make everything look super shiny

204
0:10:44.551,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and they don't tell the truth.

205
0:10:46.248,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And it's not compelling and it's not even interesting.

206
0:10:50.11,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So, we changed it

207
0:10:51.92,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and we created these full-day marketplaces,

208
0:10:55.165,000 --> 0:10:56,000
kind of like a big bazaar.

209
0:10:57.292,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And everybody was dressed up in costume,

210
0:10:59.34,000 --> 0:11:01,000
some people a little, some people a lot.

211
0:11:01.683,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And sellers had to man their stalls

212
0:11:04.001,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and sell their ideas as persuasively as possible,

213
0:11:07.072,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and people who were convinced bought them with fake check books.

214
0:11:10.879,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Creating just a bit of silliness with the environment

215
0:11:13.391,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and a hat or a scarf

216
0:11:14.776,000 --> 0:11:18,000
drops people's guard and causes ideas to spread like wildfire.

217
0:11:20.243,000 --> 0:11:22,000
There's no recipe here,

218
0:11:22.299,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but time together has to be carefully curated and created

219
0:11:27.955,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so that people know that their time is valuable and important,

220
0:11:32.538,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and they can bring their best selves to the table.

221
0:11:37.071,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Hero culture is present right here in TED.

222
0:11:40.705,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This whole process makes it look like I think I'm a hero.

223
0:11:46.157,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So just in case there's any doubt about the point that I'm trying to make,

224
0:11:50.876,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I want to apply these ideas

225
0:11:53.209,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in an area in which I have zero credibility

226
0:11:56.08,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and zero experience.

227
0:11:58.225,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'm originally South African,

228
0:12:00.273,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and I'm deeply passionate about wildlife conservation,

229
0:12:03.347,000 --> 0:12:04,000
most particularly rhinos.

230
0:12:05.648,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Those majestic creatures with big horns.

231
0:12:09.624,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Every day, three rhinos are killed,

232
0:12:12.593,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because there are people who think that those horns are valuable,

233
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
even though they're just made of the same stuff

234
0:12:18.908,000 --> 0:12:19,000
as hair and fingernails.

235
0:12:21.891,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It breaks my heart.

236
0:12:25.106,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Like all good recovering heroes,

237
0:12:27.939,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I did everything I could to reduce this goal

238
0:12:31.704,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to something that I could do by myself.

239
0:12:35.085,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But clearly, stopping rhino poaching is a goal way too big for me.

240
0:12:40.53,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So I'm immediately in interdependence land.

241
0:12:44.76,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'm declaring my goal on this stage.

242
0:12:48.252,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I found other people as passionate as I am

243
0:12:50.887,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and I've asked if I could join them.

244
0:12:52.919,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And after today, there may be more.

245
0:12:55.331,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And we're now in the complex but inspiring process

246
0:12:58.765,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of learning how to work together.

247
0:13:01.046,000 --> 0:13:04,000
My dream is that one day, someone will stand on this stage

248
0:13:04.292,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved rhinos.

249
0:13:10.442,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Why does hero culture persist,

250
0:13:12.662,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and why don't we work together more?

251
0:13:15.784,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Well, I don't know why everyone else does it,

252
0:13:17.927,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but I can tell you why I did it.

253
0:13:20.496,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Interdependence is a lot harder than being a hero.

254
0:13:24.694,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable,

255
0:13:28.274,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and that's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do.

256
0:13:33.048,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I thought being a hero would keep me safe.

257
0:13:37.056,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I thought that in the elevation

258
0:13:39.143,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and separation that comes from heroic leadership,

259
0:13:42.339,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that I would be untouchable.

260
0:13:46.228,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This is an illusion.

261
0:13:48.776,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The joy and success that comes from interdependence and vulnerability

262
0:13:52.847,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is worth the effort and the risk.

263
0:13:56.339,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And if we're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today,

264
0:14:00.14,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we have no alternative,

265
0:14:01.772,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so we had better start getting good at it.

266
0:14:05.532,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thank you.

267
0:14:06.706,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

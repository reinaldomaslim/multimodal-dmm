2
0:00:12.879,000 --> 0:00:13,000
The first time I stood in the operating room

3
0:00:14.855,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and watched a real surgery,

4
0:00:16.727,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I had no idea what to expect.

5
0:00:19.302,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was a college student in engineering.

6
0:00:21.277,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I thought it was going to be like on TV.

7
0:00:23.477,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Ominous music playing in the background,

8
0:00:25.382,000 --> 0:00:27,000
beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.

9
0:00:28.381,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But it wasn't like that at all.

10
0:00:30.541,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There was music playing on this day,

11
0:00:32.14,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)

12
0:00:34.862,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And there was plenty of conversation,

13
0:00:36.989,000 --> 0:00:38,000
not just about the patient's heart rate,

14
0:00:38.989,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but about sports and weekend plans.

15
0:00:41.762,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And since then, the more surgeries I watched,

16
0:00:43.698,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the more I realized this is how it is.

17
0:00:45.525,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In some weird way, it's just another day at the office.

18
0:00:48.278,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But every so often

19
0:00:50.183,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the music gets turned down,

20
0:00:52.281,000 --> 0:00:53,000
everyone stops talking,

21
0:00:53.711,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and stares at exactly the same thing.

22
0:00:56.695,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And that's when you know that something absolutely critical

23
0:00:58.855,000 --> 0:01:,000
and dangerous is happening.

24
0:01:01.295,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The first time I saw that

25
0:01:02.311,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I was watching a type of surgery

26
0:01:03.543,000 --> 0:01:05,000
called laparoscopic surgery

27
0:01:05.832,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And for those of you who are unfamiliar,

28
0:01:08.39,000 --> 0:01:1,000
laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large

29
0:01:10.783,000 --> 0:01:12,000
open incision you might be used to with surgery,

30
0:01:13.277,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates

31
0:01:15.485,000 --> 0:01:18,000
these three or more small incisions in the patient.

32
0:01:18.502,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And then inserts these long, thin instruments

33
0:01:21.368,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and a camera,

34
0:01:22.482,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and actually does the procedure inside the patient.

35
0:01:26.333,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is great because there's much less risk of infection,

36
0:01:28.925,000 --> 0:01:31,000
much less pain, shorter recovery time.

37
0:01:32.085,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But there is a trade-off,

38
0:01:34.677,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because these incisions are created

39
0:01:36.461,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with a long, pointed device

40
0:01:38.959,000 --> 0:01:39,000
called a trocar.

41
0:01:40.423,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And the way the surgeon uses this device

42
0:01:42.617,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is that he takes it

43
0:01:44.033,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and he presses it into the abdomen

44
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
until it punctures through.

45
0:01:49.255,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And now the reason why everyone in the operating room

46
0:01:52.327,000 --> 0:01:54,000
was staring at that device on that day

47
0:01:54.974,000 --> 0:01:57,000
was because he had to be absolutely careful

48
0:01:58.205,000 --> 0:01:59,000
not to plunge it through

49
0:01:59.672,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below.

50
0:02:03.613,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you

51
0:02:05.452,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere else.

52
0:02:08.373,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:10.165,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Remember this?

54
0:02:11.821,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Applause)

55
0:02:15.937,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You knew that at any second

56
0:02:17.813,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that straw was going to plunge through,

57
0:02:19.693,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and you didn't know if it was going to go out the other side

58
0:02:21.278,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and straight into your hand,

59
0:02:22.581,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or if you were going to get juice everywhere,

60
0:02:24.277,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but you were terrified. Right?

61
0:02:27.58,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Every single time you did this,

62
0:02:29.556,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you experienced the same fundamental physics

63
0:02:32.112,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that I was watching in the operating room that day.

64
0:02:35.192,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And it turns out it really is a problem.

65
0:02:37.738,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said

66
0:02:40.53,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step

67
0:02:43.907,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in minimally invasive surgery.

68
0:02:45.923,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Again in 2009, we see a paper that says

69
0:02:48.363,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that trocars account for over half

70
0:02:50.547,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.

71
0:02:54.234,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And, oh by the way,

72
0:02:55.376,000 --> 0:02:58,000
this hasn't changed for 25 years.

73
0:02:58.97,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So when I got to graduate school,

74
0:03:00.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
this is what I wanted to work on.

75
0:03:02.368,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I was trying to explain to a friend of mine

76
0:03:04.176,000 --> 0:03:06,000
what exactly I was spending my time doing,

77
0:03:06.291,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I said,

78
0:03:08.107,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"It's like when you're drilling through a wall

79
0:03:10.283,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to hang something in your apartment.

80
0:03:13.483,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall

81
0:03:17.395,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and there's this plunge. Right?

82
0:03:23.389,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And he looked at me and he said,

83
0:03:25.43,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"You mean like when they drill into people's brains?"

84
0:03:28.901,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)

85
0:03:31.233,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains.

86
0:03:34.281,000 --> 0:03:36,000
A lot of neurosurgical procedures

87
0:03:36.345,000 --> 0:03:39,000
actually start with a drill incision through the skull.

88
0:03:40.127,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And if the surgeon isn't careful,

89
0:03:41.912,000 --> 0:03:44,000
he can plunge directly into the brain.

90
0:03:45.496,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So this is the moment when I started thinking,

91
0:03:47.662,000 --> 0:03:5,000
okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,

92
0:03:50.97,000 --> 0:03:51,000
why not other areas of medicine?

93
0:03:52.634,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Because think about it, when was the last time you went to the doctor

94
0:03:54.578,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and you didn't get stuck with something? Right?

95
0:03:57.325,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So the truth is

96
0:03:58.642,000 --> 0:04:,000
in medicine puncture is everywhere.

97
0:04:01.194,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found

98
0:04:03.986,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that involve some tissue puncture step.

99
0:04:07.195,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And if we take just three of them —

100
0:04:09.274,000 --> 0:04:13,000
laparoscopic surgery, epidurals, and cranial drilling —

101
0:04:13.37,000 --> 0:04:16,000
these procedures account for over 30,000 complications

102
0:04:17.349,000 --> 0:04:19,000
every year in this country alone.

103
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I call that a problem worth solving.

104
0:04:22.915,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So let's take a look at some of the devices

105
0:04:25.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that are used in these types of procedures.

106
0:04:27.744,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.

107
0:04:30.969,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine

108
0:04:33.286,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.

109
0:04:35.725,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.

110
0:04:38.278,000 --> 0:04:39,000
These are actually used to burrow into the bone

111
0:04:40.214,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions.

112
0:04:43.714,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.

113
0:04:45.624,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:48.64,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If I had told you it was a medical puncture device

115
0:04:51.233,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you probably would have believed me.

116
0:04:53.449,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Because what's the difference?

117
0:04:55.642,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, the more I did this research

118
0:04:57.577,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the more I thought there has to be

119
0:04:59.161,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a better way to do this.

120
0:05:01.19,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And for me the key to this problem

121
0:05:03.609,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is that all these different puncture devices

122
0:05:06.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
share a common set of fundamental physics.

123
0:05:09.822,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So what are those physics?

124
0:05:11.374,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Let's go back to drilling through a wall.

125
0:05:12.966,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So you're applying a force on a drill towards the wall.

126
0:05:16.598,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back,

127
0:05:19.942,000 --> 0:05:2,000
equal and opposite.

128
0:05:21.207,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, as you drill through the wall,

129
0:05:23.17,000 --> 0:05:24,000
those forces balance.

130
0:05:25.1,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But then there's that moment

131
0:05:26.641,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall,

132
0:05:28.777,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and right at that moment the wall can't push back anymore.

133
0:05:31.633,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But your brain hasn't reacted to that change in force.

134
0:05:35.1,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So for that millisecond,

135
0:05:36.161,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or however long it takes you to react, you're still pushing,

136
0:05:38.793,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and that unbalanced force causes an acceleration,

137
0:05:41.337,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that is the plunge.

138
0:05:44.449,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But what if right at the moment of puncture

139
0:05:48.353,000 --> 0:05:49,000
you could pull that tip back,

140
0:05:49.977,000 --> 0:05:52,000
actually oppose the forward acceleration?

141
0:05:52.99,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's what I set out to do.

142
0:05:55.127,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So imagine you have a device

143
0:05:56.447,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it's got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue.

144
0:05:59.647,000 --> 0:06:02,000
What's the simplest way you could pull that tip back?

145
0:06:02.86,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I chose a spring.

146
0:06:04.671,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So when you extend that spring, you extend that tip out

147
0:06:07.255,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so it's ready to puncture tissue,

148
0:06:09.47,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the spring wants to pull the tip back.

149
0:06:10.91,000 --> 0:06:11,000
How do you keep the tip in place

150
0:06:12.663,000 --> 0:06:14,000
until the moment of puncture?

151
0:06:15.127,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I used this mechanism.

152
0:06:17.55,000 --> 0:06:19,000
When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue,

153
0:06:20.111,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall.

154
0:06:23.951,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the friction that's generated

155
0:06:25.655,000 --> 0:06:28,000
locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip.

156
0:06:28.847,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But right at the moment of puncture,

157
0:06:30.734,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the tissue can't push back on the tip anymore.

158
0:06:32.798,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip.

159
0:06:35.98,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Let me show you that happening in slow motion.

160
0:06:37.63,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is about 2,000 frames a second,

161
0:06:39.278,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I'd like you to notice the tip

162
0:06:41.15,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that's right there on the bottom, about to puncture through tissue.

163
0:06:43.778,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And you'll see that right at the moment of puncture,

164
0:06:48.59,000 --> 0:06:51,000
right there, the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back.

165
0:06:51.892,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.

166
0:06:54.236,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,

167
0:06:56.428,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and right when it punctures that rubber membrane

168
0:06:58.42,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath.

169
0:07:02.572,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Right there.

170
0:07:04.437,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That happens within four 100ths of a second after puncture.

171
0:07:09.101,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture

172
0:07:12.901,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and not the specifics of cranial drilling

173
0:07:14.733,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or laparoscopic surgery, or another procedure,

174
0:07:16.94,000 --> 0:07:18,000
it's applicable across these different medical disciplines

175
0:07:19.597,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and across different length scales.

176
0:07:22.628,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But it didn't always look like this.

177
0:07:24.741,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This was my first prototype.

178
0:07:26.926,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Yes, those are popsicle sticks,

179
0:07:29.568,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and there's a rubber band at the top.

180
0:07:31.47,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.

181
0:07:34.87,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And it proved to me that my idea worked

182
0:07:36.566,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and it justified the next couple years of work on this project.

183
0:07:39.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I worked on this because

184
0:07:41.766,000 --> 0:07:42,000
this problem really fascinated me.

185
0:07:43.429,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It kept me up at night.

186
0:07:45.558,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But I think it should fascinate you too,

187
0:07:48.54,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because I said puncture is everywhere.

188
0:07:50.442,000 --> 0:07:54,000
That means at some point it's going to be your problem too.

189
0:07:54.706,000 --> 0:07:55,000
That first day in the operating room

190
0:07:56.266,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar.

191
0:07:59.25,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But last year, I got appendicitis when I was visiting Greece.

192
0:08:03.14,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So I was in the hospital in Athens,

193
0:08:04.97,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and the surgeon was telling me

194
0:08:06.458,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery.

195
0:08:08.594,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions,

196
0:08:11.346,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery,

197
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and what was going to happen.

198
0:08:15.482,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He said, "Do you have any questions?" And I said, "Just one, doc.

199
0:08:17.9,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What kind of trocar do you use?"

200
0:08:21.374,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery

201
0:08:24.879,000 --> 0:08:26,000
comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:

202
0:08:27.525,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"It is puncture itself that causes risk."

203
0:08:31.189,000 --> 0:08:34,000
That's my favorite quote because H.C. Jacobaeus

204
0:08:34.325,000 --> 0:08:38,000
was the first person to ever perform laparoscopic surgery on humans,

205
0:08:38.365,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and he wrote that in 1912.

206
0:08:41.797,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years.

207
0:08:47.581,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there

208
0:08:49.815,000 --> 0:08:52,000
there's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it.

209
0:08:53.751,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The truth is that's not always the case.

210
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We have to be better at finding those problems

211
0:08:59.545,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and finding ways to solve them.

212
0:09:02.313,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So if you come across a problem that grabs you,

213
0:09:05.569,000 --> 0:09:06,000
let it keep you up at night.

214
0:09:07.45,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Allow yourself to be fascinated,

215
0:09:09.593,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because there are so many lives to save.

216
0:09:12.505,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

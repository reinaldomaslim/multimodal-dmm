1
0:00:12.9,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When my first children's book was published

2
0:00:14.57,000 --> 0:00:15,000
in 2001,

3
0:00:16.293,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I returned to my old elementary school

4
0:00:18.506,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to talk to the students about being an author

5
0:00:20.446,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and an illustrator,

6
0:00:22.162,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and when I was setting up my slide projector

7
0:00:24.895,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the cafetorium,

8
0:00:28.1,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I looked across the room,

9
0:00:30.148,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and there she was:

10
0:00:32.759,000 --> 0:00:33,000
my old lunch lady.

11
0:00:34.603,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She was still there at the school

12
0:00:36.57,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.

13
0:00:39.456,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I approached her to say hello,

14
0:00:41.1,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"

15
0:00:42.987,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And she looked at me, and I could tell

16
0:00:44.557,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that she recognized me,

17
0:00:46.284,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but she couldn't quite place me, and she looked at me and she said,

18
0:00:49.369,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"Stephen Krosoczka?"

19
0:00:52.13,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,

20
0:00:54.272,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but Stephen is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am,

21
0:00:57.703,000 --> 0:01:,000
and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.

22
0:01:00.84,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And she started telling me about her grandkids,

23
0:01:03.345,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that blew my mind.

24
0:01:06.05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
My lunch lady had grandkids,

25
0:01:07.844,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and therefore kids,

26
0:01:08.808,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and therefore left school at the end of the day?

27
0:01:12.063,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I thought she lived in the cafeteria

28
0:01:13.806,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with the serving spoons.

29
0:01:14.679,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I had never thought about any of that before.

30
0:01:16.622,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,

31
0:01:20.354,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,

32
0:01:23.905,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a series of comics about a lunch lady

33
0:01:26.082,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who uses her fish stick nunchucks

34
0:01:28.68,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,

35
0:01:31.582,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,

36
0:01:34.889,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the end of every book,

37
0:01:36.356,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they get the bad guy with their hairnet,

38
0:01:37.862,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they proclaim, "Justice is served!"

39
0:01:41.616,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

40
0:01:45.869,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And it's been amazing, because the series

41
0:01:48.476,000 --> 0:01:5,000
was so welcomed into the reading lives of children,

42
0:01:51.369,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and they sent me the most amazing letters

43
0:01:53.608,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and cards and artwork.

44
0:01:55.765,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I would notice as I would visit schools,

45
0:01:58.239,000 --> 0:02:,000
the lunch staff would be involved in the programming

46
0:02:00.793,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in a very meaningful way.

47
0:02:02.939,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And coast to coast,

48
0:02:04.685,000 --> 0:02:06,000
all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:

49
0:02:06.78,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."

50
0:02:10.675,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because the lunch lady has not been treated

51
0:02:13.444,000 --> 0:02:16,000
very kindly in popular culture over time.

52
0:02:16.966,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But it meant the most to Jeannie.

53
0:02:19.138,000 --> 0:02:2,000
When the books were first published,

54
0:02:20.828,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I invited her to the book launch party,

55
0:02:22.932,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and in front of everyone there,

56
0:02:24.743,000 --> 0:02:25,000
everyone she had fed over the years,

57
0:02:26.04,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.

58
0:02:28.98,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And two years after this photo was taken,

59
0:02:31.549,000 --> 0:02:32,000
she passed away,

60
0:02:33.36,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I attended her wake,

61
0:02:34.447,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there,

62
0:02:37.286,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because next to her casket was this painting,

63
0:02:40.774,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and her husband told me it meant so much to her

64
0:02:44.34,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that I had acknowledged her hard work,

65
0:02:46.758,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I had validated what she did.

66
0:02:49.624,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that inspired me to create a day

67
0:02:51.516,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where we could recreate that feeling

68
0:02:53.766,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in cafeterias across the country:

69
0:02:56.781,000 --> 0:02:57,000
School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids

70
0:02:58.434,000 --> 0:03:,000
can make creative projects for their lunch staff.

71
0:03:01.292,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association,

72
0:03:03.496,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and did you know that a little over 30 million kids

73
0:03:06.624,000 --> 0:03:07,000
participate in school lunch programs every day.

74
0:03:08.446,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That equals up to a little over five billion lunches

75
0:03:11.798,000 --> 0:03:12,000
made every school year.

76
0:03:13.305,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the stories of heroism go well beyond

77
0:03:15.691,000 --> 0:03:16,000
just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets

78
0:03:17.678,000 --> 0:03:18,000
on their lunch tray.

79
0:03:18.843,000 --> 0:03:19,000
There is Ms. Brenda in California,

80
0:03:20.552,000 --> 0:03:22,000
who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line

81
0:03:23.341,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and then reports back to the guidance counselor

82
0:03:25.826,000 --> 0:03:26,000
if anything is amiss.

83
0:03:27.176,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky

84
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who realized that 67 percent of their students

85
0:03:31.235,000 --> 0:03:32,000
relied on those meals every day,

86
0:03:33.208,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and they were going without food over the summer,

87
0:03:35.324,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so they retrofitted a school bus

88
0:03:37.348,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to create a mobile feeding unit,

89
0:03:39.1,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and they traveled around the neighborhoods

90
0:03:40.335,000 --> 0:03:42,000
feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.

91
0:03:43.134,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And kids made the most amazing projects.

92
0:03:45.729,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I knew they would.

93
0:03:46.779,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Kids made hamburger cards

94
0:03:48.391,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that were made out of construction paper.

95
0:03:50.385,000 --> 0:03:51,000
They took photos of their lunch lady's head

96
0:03:52.286,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady

97
0:03:54.094,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and fixed that to a milk carton

98
0:03:55.887,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and presented them with flowers.

99
0:03:58.373,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they made their own comics,

100
0:04:00.376,000 --> 0:04:01,000
starring the cartoon lunch lady

101
0:04:01.737,000 --> 0:04:03,000
alongside their actual lunch ladies.

102
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And they made thank you pizzas,

103
0:04:05.896,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where every kid signed a different topping

104
0:04:07.811,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of a construction paper pizza.

105
0:04:10.77,000 --> 0:04:13,000
For me, I was so moved by the response

106
0:04:14.37,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that came from the lunch ladies,

107
0:04:16.349,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because one woman said to me, she said,

108
0:04:18.228,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"Before this day, I felt like I was

109
0:04:20.763,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at the end of the planet at this school.

110
0:04:23.2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."

111
0:04:25.575,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Another woman said to me,

112
0:04:27.442,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"You know, what I got out of this

113
0:04:29.99,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is that what I do is important."

114
0:04:32.944,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And of course what she does is important.

115
0:04:35.284,000 --> 0:04:37,000
What they all do is important.

116
0:04:37.388,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They're feeding our children every single day,

117
0:04:40.777,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and before a child can learn,

118
0:04:43.236,000 --> 0:04:45,000
their belly needs to be full,

119
0:04:45.766,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and these women and men

120
0:04:47.544,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are working on the front lines to create

121
0:04:49.467,000 --> 0:04:51,000
an educated society.

122
0:04:51.67,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So I hope that

123
0:04:54.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day

124
0:04:56.341,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to say thank you to your lunch staff,

125
0:04:58.376,000 --> 0:05:,000
and I hope that you remember

126
0:05:00.424,000 --> 0:05:02,000
how powerful a thank you can be.

127
0:05:03.27,000 --> 0:05:04,000
A thank you can change a life.

128
0:05:05.265,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It changes the life of the person who receives it,

129
0:05:08.467,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and it changes the life of the person

130
0:05:10.751,000 --> 0:05:11,000
who expresses it.

131
0:05:12.377,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thank you.

132
0:05:14.733,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.627,000 --> 0:00:14,000
100 years ago,

2
0:00:15.339,000 --> 0:00:18,000
there were 2,000 varieties of peaches,

3
0:00:18.678,000 --> 0:00:21,000
nearly 2,000 different varieties of plums

4
0:00:22.478,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and almost 800 named varieties of apples growing in the United States.

5
0:00:27.333,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Today, only a fraction of those remain,

6
0:00:29.844,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and what is left is threatened by industrialization of agriculture,

7
0:00:34.139,000 --> 0:00:35,000
disease and climate change.

8
0:00:36.264,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Those varieties that are threatened include the Blood Cling,

9
0:00:40.465,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a red-flesh peach brought by Spanish missionaries to the Americas,

10
0:00:45.21,000 --> 0:00:48,000
then cultivated by Native Americans for centuries;

11
0:00:48.614,000 --> 0:00:5,000
an apricot that was brought by Chinese immigrants

12
0:00:51.332,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who came to work on the Transcontinental Railroad;

13
0:00:54.57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and countless varieties of plums that originated in the Middle East

14
0:00:58.965,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and were then brought by Italian, French and German immigrants.

15
0:01:03.116,000 --> 0:01:05,000
None of these varieties are indigenous.

16
0:01:05.357,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, almost all of our fruit trees were brought here,

17
0:01:09.687,000 --> 0:01:12,000
including apples and peaches and cherries.

18
0:01:13.395,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So more than just food,

19
0:01:14.782,000 --> 0:01:16,000
embedded within these fruit is our culture.

20
0:01:18.176,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's the people who cared for and cultivated them,

21
0:01:21.031,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who valued them so much that they brought them here with them

22
0:01:24.57,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as a connection to their home,

23
0:01:26.872,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it's the way that they've passed them on and shared them.

24
0:01:29.856,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In many ways, these fruit are our story.

25
0:01:33.062,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I was fortunate enough to learn about it

26
0:01:36.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
through an artwork that I created entitled the "Tree of 40 Fruit."

27
0:01:40.133,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The Tree of 40 Fruit is a single tree

28
0:01:42.745,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that grows 40 different varieties of stone fruit.

29
0:01:46.121,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So that's peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines and cherries

30
0:01:51.083,000 --> 0:01:52,000
all growing on one tree.

31
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's designed to be a normal-looking tree throughout the majority of the year,

32
0:01:56.701,000 --> 0:01:59,000
until spring, when it blossoms in pink and white

33
0:02:00.263,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then in summer, bears a multitude of different fruit.

34
0:02:03.753,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I began the project for purely artistic reasons:

35
0:02:07.055,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I wanted to change the reality of the everyday,

36
0:02:09.893,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and to be honest,

37
0:02:11.077,000 --> 0:02:13,000
create this startling moment when people would see this tree

38
0:02:13.95,000 --> 0:02:16,000
blossom in all these different colors

39
0:02:17.332,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and bear all of these different fruit.

40
0:02:19.188,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I created the Tree of 40 Fruit through the process of grafting.

41
0:02:22.782,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'll collect cuttings in winter, store them,

42
0:02:25.753,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and then graft them onto the ends of branches in spring.

43
0:02:28.943,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In fact, almost all fruit trees are grafted,

44
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because the seed of a fruit tree is a genetic variant of the parent.

45
0:02:35.867,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So when we find a variety that we really like,

46
0:02:39.207,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the way that we propagate it is by taking a cutting off of one tree

47
0:02:42.923,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and putting it onto another --

48
0:02:44.416,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is kind of crazy to think

49
0:02:46.642,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that every single Macintosh apple came from one tree

50
0:02:50.724,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that's been grafted over and over from generation to generation.

51
0:02:55.603,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But it also means that fruit trees can't be preserved by seed.

52
0:03:00.147,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I've known about grafting as long as I can remember.

53
0:03:03.022,000 --> 0:03:05,000
My great-grandfather made a living grafting peach orchards

54
0:03:05.974,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in Southeastern Pennsylvania.

55
0:03:07.831,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And although I never met him,

56
0:03:09.287,000 --> 0:03:11,000
any time anyone would mention his name,

57
0:03:11.523,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they were quick to note

58
0:03:12.698,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that he knew how to graft as if he had a magical or mystical capability.

59
0:03:16.817,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I decided on the number 40 for the Tree of 40 Fruit

60
0:03:19.841,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because it's found throughout Western religion

61
0:03:22.071,000 --> 0:03:24,000
as not the quantifiable dozen and not the infinite

62
0:03:24.992,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but a number that's beyond counting.

63
0:03:27.017,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's a bounty or a multitude.

64
0:03:29.791,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But the problem was that when I started,

65
0:03:31.816,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I couldn't find 40 different varieties of these fruit,

66
0:03:35.491,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and this is despite the fact that I live in New York state,

67
0:03:38.317,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which, a century ago,

68
0:03:39.791,000 --> 0:03:41,000
was one of the leading producers of these fruit.

69
0:03:42.582,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So as they were tearing out research orchards

70
0:03:45.178,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and old, vintage orchards,

71
0:03:46.562,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I would collect branches off them

72
0:03:48.492,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and graft them onto trees in my nursery.

73
0:03:51.14,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So this is what the Tree of 40 Fruit look like when they were first planted,

74
0:03:54.96,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and this is what they look like six years later.

75
0:03:57.257,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is definitely not a sport of immediate gratification --

76
0:04:00.123,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:01.741,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It takes a year to know if a graft has succeeded;

78
0:04:05.203,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it takes two to three years to know if it produces fruit;

79
0:04:08.373,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it takes up to eight years to create just one of the trees.

80
0:04:12.943,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Each of the varieties grafted to the Tree of 40 Fruit

81
0:04:15.764,000 --> 0:04:17,000
has a slightly different form and a slightly different color.

82
0:04:19.214,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I realized that by creating a timeline of when all these blossomed

83
0:04:22.641,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in relationship to each other,

84
0:04:24.547,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I can essentially shape or design how the tree appears during spring.

85
0:04:29.102,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And this is how they appear during summer.

86
0:04:31.127,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They produce fruit from June through September.

87
0:04:33.929,000 --> 0:04:35,000
First is cherries, then apricots,

88
0:04:36.513,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Asian plums, nectarines and peaches,

89
0:04:39.847,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I think I forgot one in there, somewhere ...

90
0:04:42.191,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:43.5,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Although it's an artwork that exists outside of the gallery,

92
0:04:46.542,000 --> 0:04:47,000
as the project continues,

93
0:04:48.217,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it's been conservation by way of the art world.

94
0:04:51.173,000 --> 0:04:53,000
As I've been asked to create these in different locations,

95
0:04:53.913,000 --> 0:04:55,000
what I'll do is I'll research varieties

96
0:04:56.235,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that originated or were historically grown in that area,

97
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'll source them locally and graft them to the tree

98
0:05:02.642,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so that it becomes an agricultural history of the area where they're located.

99
0:05:06.458,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then the project got picked up online,

100
0:05:08.8,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which was horrifying and humbling.

101
0:05:11.078,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The horrifying part was all of the tattoos that I saw

102
0:05:14.927,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of images of the Tree of 40 Fruit.

103
0:05:16.806,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:17.853,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Which I was like, "Why would you do that to your body?"

105
0:05:20.504,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:21.623,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And the humbling part was all of the requests that I received

107
0:05:24.788,000 --> 0:05:26,000
from pastors, from rabbis and priests

108
0:05:27.743,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who asked to use the tree as a central part within their service.

109
0:05:30.926,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And then it became a meme --

110
0:05:32.593,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the answer to that question is "I hope not?"

111
0:05:36.236,000 --> 0:05:38,000
[Is your marriage like the Tree of 40 Fruit?]

112
0:05:38.474,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:39.649,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Like all good memes,

114
0:05:40.961,000 --> 0:05:43,000
this has led to an interview on NPR's "Weekend Edition,"

115
0:05:44.461,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and as a college professor, I thought I peaked --

116
0:05:48.478,000 --> 0:05:5,000
like, that was the pinnacle of my career --

117
0:05:50.845,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but you never know who's listening to NPR.

118
0:05:54.14,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And several weeks after the NPR interview,

119
0:05:57.496,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I received an email from the Department of Defense.

120
0:06:00.368,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The Defense Advanced Research Project Administration invited me

121
0:06:04.401,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to come talk about innovation and creativity,

122
0:06:07.422,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and it's a conversation that quickly shifted to a discussion of food security.

123
0:06:11.957,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You see, our national security is dependent upon our food security.

124
0:06:16.829,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now that we've created these monocultures

125
0:06:18.933,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that only grow a few varieties of each crop,

126
0:06:22.198,000 --> 0:06:24,000
if something happens to just one of those varieties,

127
0:06:25.195,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it can have a dramatic impact upon our food supply.

128
0:06:28.388,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the key to maintaining our food security

129
0:06:31.42,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is preserving our biodiversity.

130
0:06:33.69,000 --> 0:06:37,000
100 years ago, this was done by everybody that had a garden

131
0:06:38.149,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or a small stand of trees in their backyard,

132
0:06:40.697,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and grew varieties that were passed down through their family.

133
0:06:43.808,000 --> 0:06:47,000
These are plums from just one Tree of 40 Fruit in one week in August.

134
0:06:48.699,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Several years into the project,

135
0:06:50.25,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I was told that I have one of the largest collections of these fruit

136
0:06:53.629,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in the Eastern United States,

137
0:06:55.677,000 --> 0:06:57,000
which, as an artist, is absolutely terrifying.

138
0:06:58.679,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:00.3,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But in many ways, I didn't know what I had.

140
0:07:02.536,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I discovered that the majority of the varieties I had

141
0:07:05.05,000 --> 0:07:06,000
were heirloom varieties,

142
0:07:06.234,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so those that were grown before 1945,

143
0:07:09.13,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which is seen as the dawn of the industrialization of agriculture.

144
0:07:13.059,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Several of the varieties dated back thousands and thousands of years.

145
0:07:17.864,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And finding out how rare they were,

146
0:07:21.071,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I became obsessed with trying to preserve them,

147
0:07:24.079,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the vehicle for this became art.

148
0:07:25.921,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I would go into old, vintage orchards before they were torn out

149
0:07:29.085,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I would save the bowl or the trunk section

150
0:07:31.454,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that possessed the original graft union.

151
0:07:33.642,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I started doing pressings of flowers and the leaves

152
0:07:37.378,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to create herbarium specimens.

153
0:07:39.19,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I started to sequence the DNA.

154
0:07:41.365,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But ultimately, I set out to preserve the story

155
0:07:45.092,000 --> 0:07:48,000
through these copper-plate etchings and letterpress descriptions.

156
0:07:48.418,000 --> 0:07:51,000
To tell the story of the George IV peach,

157
0:07:52.148,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which took root between two buildings in New York City --

158
0:07:55.763,000 --> 0:07:57,000
someone walks by, tastes it,

159
0:07:58.372,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it becomes a major commercial variety in the 19th century

160
0:08:01.804,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because it tastes just that good.

161
0:08:04.833,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Then all but vanishes,

162
0:08:06.678,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because it doesn't ship well

163
0:08:08.167,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and it doesn't conform to modern agriculture.

164
0:08:11.716,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But I realize that as a story, it needs to be told.

165
0:08:15.273,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And in the telling of that story,

166
0:08:17.02,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it has to include the experience of being able to touch,

167
0:08:21.245,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to smell and to taste those varieties.

168
0:08:23.685,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So I set out to create an orchard

169
0:08:25.881,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to make these fruit available to the public,

170
0:08:28.457,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and have the aim of placing them in the highest density of people

171
0:08:31.745,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that I could possibly find.

172
0:08:33.555,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Naturally, I started looking for an acre of land in New York City --

173
0:08:37.327,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:38.352,000 --> 0:08:42,000
which, in retrospect, seemed, like, rather ambitious,

175
0:08:42.756,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and probably the reason why nobody was returning my phone calls or emails --

176
0:08:47.087,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:48.118,000 --> 0:08:53,000
until eventually, four years later, I heard back from Governors Island.

178
0:08:53.191,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So Governors Island is a former naval base

179
0:08:56.65,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that was given to the City of New York in 2000.

180
0:08:59.248,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it opened up all of this land

181
0:09:00.904,000 --> 0:09:02,000
just a five-minute ferry ride from New York.

182
0:09:03.216,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And they invited me to create a project that we're calling the "Open Orchard"

183
0:09:07.654,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that will bring back fruit varieties

184
0:09:09.463,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that haven't been grown in New York for over a century.

185
0:09:12.721,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Currently in progress,

186
0:09:14.207,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The Open Orchard will be 50 multigrafted trees

187
0:09:18.393,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that possess 200 heirloom and antique fruit varieties.

188
0:09:23.647,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So these are varieties that originated or were historically grown in the region.

189
0:09:28.049,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Varieties like the Early Strawberry apple,

190
0:09:30.64,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which originated on 13th Street and Third Avenue.

191
0:09:34.143,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Since a fruit tree can't be preserved by seed,

192
0:09:37.135,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The Open Orchard will act like a living gene bank,

193
0:09:40.031,000 --> 0:09:41,000
or an archive of these fruit.

194
0:09:41.597,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Like the Tree of 40 Fruit,

195
0:09:43.008,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it will be experiential;

196
0:09:44.413,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it will also be symbolic.

197
0:09:46.207,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Most importantly, it's going to invite people to participate in conservation

198
0:09:51.191,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and to learn more about their food.

199
0:09:53.356,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Through the Tree of 40 Fruit,

200
0:09:54.876,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I've received thousands and thousands of emails from people,

201
0:09:57.71,000 --> 0:10:,000
asking basic questions about "How do you plant a tree?"

202
0:10:01.661,000 --> 0:10:03,000
With less than three percent of the population

203
0:10:03.841,000 --> 0:10:05,000
having any direct tie to agriculture,

204
0:10:06.481,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the Open Orchard is going to invite people

205
0:10:09.045,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to come take part in public programming and to take part in workshops,

206
0:10:13.247,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to learn how to graft, to grow, to prune and to harvest a tree;

207
0:10:17.534,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to take part in fresh eating and blossom tours;

208
0:10:20.407,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to work with local chefs to learn how to use these fruit

209
0:10:23.106,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and to recreate centuries-old dishes

210
0:10:25.241,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that many of these varieties were grown specifically for.

211
0:10:28.606,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Extending beyond the physical site of the orchard,

212
0:10:30.964,000 --> 0:10:33,000
it will be a cookbook that compiles all of those recipes.

213
0:10:34.753,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It will be a field guide

214
0:10:36.274,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that talks about the characteristics and traits of those fruit,

215
0:10:39.647,000 --> 0:10:4,000
their origin and their story.

216
0:10:41.368,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Growing up on a farm, I thought I understood agriculture,

217
0:10:44.759,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and I didn't want anything to do with it.

218
0:10:47.523,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So I became an artist --

219
0:10:49.111,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

220
0:10:51.377,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But I have to admit that it's something within my own DNA.

221
0:10:55.358,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I don't think that I'm the only one.

222
0:10:57.721,000 --> 0:11:02,000
100 years ago, we were all much more closely tied to the culture,

223
0:11:02.853,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the cultivation and the story of our food,

224
0:11:05.869,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and we've been separated from that.

225
0:11:08.259,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The Open Orchard creates the opportunity

226
0:11:10.647,000 --> 0:11:13,000
not just to reconnect to this unknown past,

227
0:11:14.258,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but a way for us to consider what the future of our food could be.

228
0:11:18.428,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Thank you.

229
0:11:19.603,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I'm a professional poker player,

2
0:00:15.342,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and today, I want to talk about three things that the game has taught me

3
0:00:20.636,000 --> 0:00:23,000
around decision-making that I find apply to everyday life.

4
0:00:25.061,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now the first of these things is about luck.

5
0:00:27.876,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, like poker, life is also a game of skill and luck,

6
0:00:32.738,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and when it comes to the biggest things we care about --

7
0:00:35.44,000 --> 0:00:37,000
health, wealth and relationships --

8
0:00:38.241,000 --> 0:00:41,000
these outcomes don't only depend on the quality of our decision-making,

9
0:00:42.099,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but also the roll of life's dice.

10
0:00:43.868,000 --> 0:00:45,000
For example, we can be perfectly health-conscious

11
0:00:46.879,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and still get unlucky with something like cancer.

12
0:00:50.273,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Or we can smoke 20 a day and live to a ripe old age,

13
0:00:53.416,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and this kind of ambiguity can make it hard for us to know

14
0:00:56.963,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how good our strategies are, sometimes,

15
0:00:59.583,000 --> 0:01:01,000
especially when we're experiencing a lot of success.

16
0:01:03.043,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For example, back in 2010,

17
0:01:04.901,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I won a really big poker tournament known as the European Poker Tour.

18
0:01:08.909,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And because I'd only been playing full-time for about a year,

19
0:01:12.275,000 --> 0:01:14,000
when I won, I assumed I must be rather brilliant.

20
0:01:16.106,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant

21
0:01:17.972,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game,

22
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but I also got more risky,

23
0:01:23.114,000 --> 0:01:26,000
started playing in the biggest tournaments I could

24
0:01:26.146,000 --> 0:01:28,000
against the very best in the world.

25
0:01:28.685,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And then my profit graph went from a thing of beauty

26
0:01:32.201,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to something kind of sad,

27
0:01:34.637,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with this worrying downhill trend for a long time,

28
0:01:37.021,000 --> 0:01:4,000
until I finally realized that I was overestimating my skill level,

29
0:01:40.51,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and got my act together.

30
0:01:42.525,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this kind of reminds me of what we've been seeing

31
0:01:45.066,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in the cryptocurrency space, at least in 2017,

32
0:01:47.836,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where the only thing that's been going up faster than the markets themselves

33
0:01:51.449,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is the number of "senior investment specialists"

34
0:01:53.95,000 --> 0:01:55,000
who have been appearing out of nowhere.

35
0:01:56.362,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now I'm not saying it's not possible to have a strategic edge,

36
0:01:59.352,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but at the same time, it's very easy to feel like a genius

37
0:02:02.456,000 --> 0:02:04,000
when you're in a market that's going up so fast

38
0:02:04.892,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that even the worst strategies are making a profit.

39
0:02:07.322,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So when we're experiencing success,

40
0:02:09.655,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it's important to take a moment to really ask ourselves

41
0:02:12.536,000 --> 0:02:14,000
how much of it is truly down to us,

42
0:02:15.192,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because our egos love to downplay the luck factor when we're winning.

43
0:02:21.058,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now, a second thing poker taught me

44
0:02:23.263,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is the importance of quantifying my thinking.

45
0:02:26.63,000 --> 0:02:28,000
When you're playing, you can't just get away with going,

46
0:02:29.553,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Eh, they're probably bluffing."

47
0:02:31.256,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That's just going to lose you a bunch of money,

48
0:02:33.504,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because poker is a game of probabilities and precision,

49
0:02:36.727,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and so you have to train yourself to think in numbers.

50
0:02:40.247,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So now, whenever I catch myself

51
0:02:42.453,000 --> 0:02:45,000
thinking vaguely about something really important, like,

52
0:02:46.026,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"It's unlikely I'll forget what I want to say in my TED Talk,"

53
0:02:49.275,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I now try to estimate it numerically.

54
0:02:52.819,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:53.844,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Trust me, it helps a lot with the planning process.

56
0:02:56.342,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the thing is, almost anything that could possibly happen here today,

57
0:02:59.786,000 --> 0:03:,000
or at any point in the future,

58
0:03:01.365,000 --> 0:03:03,000
can also be expressed as a probability, too.

59
0:03:04.333,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:07.072,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So now I also try to speak in numbers as well.

61
0:03:10.501,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So if someone asks me,

62
0:03:11.676,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going to come along to that thing tonight?"

63
0:03:15.215,000 --> 0:03:17,000
instead of just saying to them, "Yeah, probably,"

64
0:03:17.556,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I actually give them my best estimate --

65
0:03:19.408,000 --> 0:03:2,000
say, 60 percent.

66
0:03:21.274,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Because -- I know that sounds a little odd --

67
0:03:23.401,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter

68
0:03:26.497,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of what people understand the word "probably" to mean,

69
0:03:29.085,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and this was the spread of answers.

70
0:03:30.857,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Enormous!

71
0:03:32.032,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So apparently, it's absolutely useless

72
0:03:33.889,000 --> 0:03:35,000
at actually conveying any real information.

73
0:03:36.608,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So if you guys catch yourselves using these vague words,

74
0:03:40.273,000 --> 0:03:42,000
like "probably" or "sometimes,"

75
0:03:43.193,000 --> 0:03:46,000
try, instead, using numbers, because when we speak in numbers,

76
0:03:46.416,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we know what lands in the other person's brain.

77
0:03:50.092,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, the third thing I want to touch on today is intuition.

78
0:03:55.41,000 --> 0:03:58,000
How often have you seen these kinds of inspirational memes

79
0:03:58.95,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in your Facebook feed?

80
0:04:01.018,000 --> 0:04:03,000
[Always trust your gut feeling and never second-guess.]

81
0:04:03.765,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They're nice, right?

82
0:04:05.726,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's lovely. Yes. "Trust your soul."

83
0:04:09.03,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well, they're terrible advice.

84
0:04:11.292,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These are some of the best poker players in the world right now.

85
0:04:14.786,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Do they look like people who live purely off feelings and intuitions?

86
0:04:19.271,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:20.296,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Look at them!

88
0:04:21.969,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Obviously, these guys are about slow, careful analysis,

89
0:04:26.573,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and that's because the game has outgrown the days

90
0:04:29.104,000 --> 0:04:32,000
where pure street smarts and people-reading

91
0:04:32.136,000 --> 0:04:33,000
can get you to the top.

92
0:04:33.981,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And that's because our intuitions aren't nearly as perfect

93
0:04:37.307,000 --> 0:04:38,000
as we'd like to believe.

94
0:04:38.601,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I mean, it'd be great, whenever we're in a tough spot,

95
0:04:41.167,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to just have an answer appear to us from some magical source of inspiration.

96
0:04:45.197,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But in reality, our gut is extremely vulnerable

97
0:04:48.619,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to all kinds of wishful thinking and biases.

98
0:04:52.905,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So then, what is our gut good for?

99
0:04:55.128,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Well, all the studies I've read

100
0:04:57.224,000 --> 0:05:,000
conclude that it's best-suited for everyday things

101
0:05:01.195,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that we have lots and lots of experience in,

102
0:05:03.608,000 --> 0:05:05,000
like how we just know that our friend is mad at us

103
0:05:06.362,000 --> 0:05:08,000
before we've even said anything to them,

104
0:05:08.433,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or whether we can fit our car into a tight parking spot.

105
0:05:11.609,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But when it comes to the really big stuff,

106
0:05:13.721,000 --> 0:05:15,000
like what's our career path going to be

107
0:05:16.269,000 --> 0:05:17,000
or who should we marry,

108
0:05:17.975,000 --> 0:05:2,000
why should we assume that our intuitions

109
0:05:21.524,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are better calibrated for these than slow, proper analysis?

110
0:05:25.25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I mean, they don't have any data to be based off.

111
0:05:28.528,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So my third lesson is, while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,

112
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we shouldn't overprivilege them either.

113
0:05:34.727,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I'd like to summarize these three lessons today

114
0:05:37.179,000 --> 0:05:38,000
with my own set of memes,

115
0:05:38.831,000 --> 0:05:4,000
with more of a poker-player twist.

116
0:05:41.957,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"Success is sweetest when you achieve it across a large sample size."

117
0:05:46.116,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:47.878,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"Your gut is your friend and so is a cost-benefit analysis.

119
0:05:52.322,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:53.579,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"The future is unknown, but you can damn well try and estimate it."

121
0:05:58.246,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you.

122
0:05:59.421,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.022,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This back here was my brain cancer.

2
0:00:19.125,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Isn't it nice?

3
0:00:20.869,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:23.336,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The key phrase is "was,"

5
0:00:25.822,000 --> 0:00:26,000
phew.

6
0:00:27.481,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:32.547,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Having brain cancer was really, as you can imagine,

8
0:00:36.739,000 --> 0:00:37,000
shocking news for me.

9
0:00:38.615,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I knew nothing about cancer.

10
0:00:42.059,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In Western cultures, when you have cancer,

11
0:00:45.894,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it's as if you disappear in a way.

12
0:00:48.509,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data:

13
0:00:55.147,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Your images, your exams, your lab values,

14
0:01:01.258,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a list of medicines.

15
0:01:03.74,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And everyone changes as well.

16
0:01:06.439,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You suddenly become a disease on legs.

17
0:01:09.384,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand.

18
0:01:13.983,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They start pointing their fingers

19
0:01:19.337,000 --> 0:01:23,000
at your body and your images.

20
0:01:24.187,000 --> 0:01:27,000
People start changing as well

21
0:01:27.234,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because they start dealing with the disease,

22
0:01:31.1,000 --> 0:01:33,000
instead of with the human being.

23
0:01:33.459,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They say, "What did the doctor say?"

24
0:01:35.644,000 --> 0:01:37,000
before even saying, "Hello."

25
0:01:39.976,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And in the meanwhile,

26
0:01:41.923,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer.

27
0:01:47.113,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These are the "Can I?" questions:

28
0:01:49.888,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Can I work while I have cancer?

29
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Can I study? Can I make love? Can I be creative?

30
0:01:57.864,000 --> 0:02:,000
And you wonder, "What have I done to deserve this?"

31
0:02:01.342,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You wonder, "Can I change something about my lifestyle?"

32
0:02:05.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You wonder, "Can I do something?

33
0:02:08.198,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Are there any other options?"

34
0:02:12.333,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And, obviously, doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios,

35
0:02:17.988,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you.

36
0:02:23.934,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients,

37
0:02:29.192,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you

38
0:02:36.148,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and that you become, literally, a patient --

39
0:02:41.103,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"patient" means "the one who waits."

40
0:02:43.538,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:44.955,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Things are changing, but classically,

42
0:02:49.168,000 --> 0:02:54,000
they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition,

43
0:02:54.841,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to get your friends and family engaged,

44
0:02:58.988,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle

45
0:03:02.752,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to minimize the risks of what you're going through.

46
0:03:06.083,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But instead, you're forced there to wait

47
0:03:09.971,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the hands of a series of very professional strangers.

48
0:03:16.815,000 --> 0:03:18,000
While I was in the hospital,

49
0:03:18.914,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer

50
0:03:22.356,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I spoke with it.

51
0:03:25.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It was really hard to obtain,

52
0:03:27.342,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer.

53
0:03:32.294,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I talked to it and I said,

54
0:03:34.083,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me.

55
0:03:38.635,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There's more to me.

56
0:03:40.647,000 --> 0:03:46,000
A cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me."

57
0:03:47.086,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And so, the next day, I left the hospital against medical advice.

58
0:03:53.024,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer

59
0:03:57.616,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I was determined to learn more about my cancer

60
0:04:00.484,000 --> 0:04:03,000
before doing anything as drastic as a surgery.

61
0:04:06.037,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I'm an artist, I use several forms of open-source technologies

62
0:04:12.951,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and open information in my practice.

63
0:04:15.494,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So my best bet was to get it all out there, get the information out there,

64
0:04:21.605,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone.

65
0:04:28.269,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I created a website, which is called La Cura,

66
0:04:32.246,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on which I put my medical data, online.

67
0:04:35.398,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I actually had to hack it

68
0:04:37.295,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech.

69
0:04:41.475,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:42.822,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I chose this word, La Cura --

71
0:04:45.403,000 --> 0:04:47,000
La Cura in Italian means "the cure" --

72
0:04:47.762,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because in many different cultures,

73
0:04:50.514,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the word "cure" can mean many different things.

74
0:04:55.066,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In our Western cultures,

75
0:04:56.749,000 --> 0:05:,000
it means eradicating or reversing a disease,

76
0:05:01.242,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but in different cultures,

77
0:05:02.77,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for example, a culture from Asia,

78
0:05:06.35,000 --> 0:05:1,000
from the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa,

79
0:05:10.486,000 --> 0:05:11,000
it can mean many more things.

80
0:05:12.628,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Of course, I was interested in the opinions of doctors

81
0:05:18.015,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and healthcare providers,

82
0:05:20.264,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but I was also interested in the cure of the artist, of the poet,

83
0:05:26.259,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of the designer,

84
0:05:28.436,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of, who knows, the musicians.

85
0:05:32.889,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I was interested in the social cure,

86
0:05:35.789,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I was interested in the psychological cure,

87
0:05:38.487,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I was interested in the spiritual cure,

88
0:05:41.001,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I was interested in the emotional cure,

89
0:05:44.059,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I was interested in any form of cure.

90
0:05:48.92,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And, it worked.

91
0:05:52.616,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The La Cura website went viral.

92
0:05:55.969,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad

93
0:06:00.694,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts --

94
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:07,000
emails, social networking --

95
0:06:08.378,000 --> 0:06:11,000
most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer,

96
0:06:11.573,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but more of them were about how to cure myself

97
0:06:15.004,000 --> 0:06:17,000
as a full individual.

98
0:06:18.283,000 --> 0:06:22,000
For example, many thousands of videos,

99
0:06:22.365,000 --> 0:06:25,000
images, pictures, art performances

100
0:06:26.319,000 --> 0:06:27,000
were produced for La Cura.

101
0:06:28.756,000 --> 0:06:31,000
For example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance.

102
0:06:33.141,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:

103
0:06:37.522,000 --> 0:06:41,000
He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor

104
0:06:42.1,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and put it on sale on Thingiverse.

105
0:06:44.821,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now you can have my cancer, too!

106
0:06:47.044,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:49.581,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Which is a nice thing, if you think about it,

108
0:06:52.998,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we can share our cancer.

109
0:06:56.234,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And this was going on --

110
0:06:58.633,000 --> 0:07:01,000
scientists, the traditional medicine experts,

111
0:07:02.018,000 --> 0:07:03,000
several researchers, doctors --

112
0:07:03.705,000 --> 0:07:05,000
all connected with me to give advice.

113
0:07:06.401,000 --> 0:07:07,000
With all this information and support,

114
0:07:08.32,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons,

115
0:07:14.009,000 --> 0:07:16,000
traditional doctors,

116
0:07:16.995,000 --> 0:07:22,000
oncologists, and several hundred volunteers

117
0:07:23.144,000 --> 0:07:26,000
with whom I was able to discuss

118
0:07:26.373,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the information I was receiving, which is very important.

119
0:07:31.796,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And together, we were able to form a strategy for my own cure

120
0:07:38.165,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in many languages, according to many cultures.

121
0:07:41.816,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the current strategy spans the whole world

122
0:07:45.005,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and thousands of years of human history,

123
0:07:47.627,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which is quite remarkable for me.

124
0:07:49.71,000 --> 0:07:5,000
[Surgery]

125
0:07:51.394,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer.

126
0:07:57.005,000 --> 0:08:,000
So I was able to take my time and choose.

127
0:08:00.426,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,

128
0:08:04.091,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,

129
0:08:06.489,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and in the meanwhile, I was supported by thousands of people,

130
0:08:10.5,000 --> 0:08:13,000
none of whom felt pity for me.

131
0:08:13.751,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Everyone felt like they could take an active role

132
0:08:19.429,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in helping me to get well,

133
0:08:21.265,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and this was the most important part of La Cura.

134
0:08:26.081,000 --> 0:08:27,000
What are the outcomes?

135
0:08:28.122,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.

136
0:08:30.479,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

137
0:08:35.795,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I had excellent news

138
0:08:38.227,000 --> 0:08:39,000
after the surgery --

139
0:08:39.857,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,

140
0:08:45.376,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which is a "good" kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot.

141
0:08:49.822,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle.

142
0:08:54.25,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged.

143
0:09:00.055,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery,

144
0:09:04.195,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which was very intense,

145
0:09:06.186,000 --> 0:09:09,000
a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain

146
0:09:10.131,000 --> 0:09:11,000
from this side,

147
0:09:12.021,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls.

148
0:09:17.278,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And right before the operation,

149
0:09:20.976,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain

150
0:09:27.777,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into

151
0:09:32.684,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and if there were any I wanted to avoid.

152
0:09:36.312,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Obviously, there were.

153
0:09:38.452,000 --> 0:09:39,000
[Open]

154
0:09:39.529,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura.

155
0:09:44.98,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Thousands of people shared their stories, their experiences.

156
0:09:49.799,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult

157
0:09:54.427,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when they think about cancer.

158
0:09:59.37,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I'm a self-founding, continuous state of translation

159
0:10:04.043,000 --> 0:10:06,000
among many different languages,

160
0:10:06.363,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in which science meets emotion

161
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and conventional research meets traditional research.

The most important thing of La Cura

164
0:10:21.635,000 --> 0:10:28,000
was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society

165
0:10:28.66,000 --> 0:10:34,000
whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components.

This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer.

167
0:10:41.873,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And from what I feel,

168
0:10:43.679,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it's a cure for me, but for us all.

169
0:10:46.079,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Thank you.

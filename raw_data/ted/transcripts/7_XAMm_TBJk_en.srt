1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm just going to play a brief video clip.

2
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Video:

3
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.

5
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The buyer

6
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was Kip Forbes,

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.

8
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be

9
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the prince of any wine cellar.

12
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event

13
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that he had made this incredible discovery.

17
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,

18
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.

20
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,

21
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he would not reveal exactly where the building was

22
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.

24
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,

26
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and he became suspicious.

27
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI

28
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,

30
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.

31
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But for those 20 years,

32
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.

34
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine

35
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,

36
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.

37
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of

38
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,

39
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
not only on wine but on lots of things,

40
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and are they living a better life than me?

41
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, I decided to embark on a quest.

42
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,

43
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item

44
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in about a dozen categories,

45
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which was a very grueling quest, as you can imagine.

46
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This was the first one.

48
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It may come from Wagyu cattle,

50
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.

51
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,

52
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.

54
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it arrived, and it was tiny.

55
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I was outraged.

56
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It was like, 160 dollars for this?

57
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And then I took a bite,

58
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.

59
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.

60
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I almost couldn't finish it.

61
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was really happy when I was done.

62
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this project

64
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,

65
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.

66
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you

67
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that I did not think that one was really worth the price.

68
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
White truffles.

69
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.

70
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant

71
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in Manhattan -- Del Posto.

72
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob

73
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,

74
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"Would Signore like the truffles?"

75
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.

76
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.

77
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It's in the smell.

78
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,

79
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.

80
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
10 seconds passed and it was gone.

81
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,

82
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you know, their purpose had been served,

83
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.

84
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.

85
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Yeah.

87
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.

88
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They did give me a tour, though.

90
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.

91
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It has 360-degree views.

92
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It has four balconies.

93
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.

94
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.

95
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.

96
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.

97
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.

98
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,

99
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which have antibacterial properties.

100
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.

101
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,

102
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but I have to say that nobody here

103
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.

104
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.

106
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you,

107
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,

108
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I have not gotten a compliment from anybody

109
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in the months that I have owned and worn these.

110
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment

111
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
should be the test of something's value,

112
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,

113
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that's a reasonable benchmark.

114
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That said, a lot of work goes into these.

115
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton

116
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that has been shuttle loomed

117
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.

118
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But no compliments.

119
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Thank you.

121
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil

122
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.

123
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.

124
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,

125
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.

126
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,

127
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,

128
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so you can go online and look at your batch number

129
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and see how the phenolics are developing,

130
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and, you know, gauge its freshness.

131
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.

132
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.

133
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was very green, it was very peppery.

134
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.

135
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of

136
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove

137
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for six months.

138
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --

140
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you'll start to notice.

141
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,

142
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but I did interview a guy who owns them.

143
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say

144
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed

145
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,

146
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.

147
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
You're paying for the bling,

148
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.

149
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say

150
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...

151
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Oh, yeah, you know this one?

152
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.

153
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.

154
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's a cat that lives in trees,

155
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.

156
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,

157
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.

158
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,

159
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings

160
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results

161
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it

162
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
in the unprocessed form.

163
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That's right.

164
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Unrelatedly --

165
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.

167
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.

169
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
There's one with a fragrance dispenser.

170
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl

171
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and transmits the results via email to your doctor.

172
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's almost like a home medical center --

173
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.

174
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This one does not have those bells and whistles,

175
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.

176
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,

177
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,

178
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.

179
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.

180
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The seat is preheated.

181
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There's a water jet that cleans you.

182
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
There's an air jet that dries you.

183
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You get up, it flushes by itself.

184
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The lid closes, it self-cleans.

185
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Not only is it a technological leap forward,

186
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.

187
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.

188
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I want to get one of these.

189
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.

191
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.

192
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,

193
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
each buyer gets their name engraved on it.

194
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife

196
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
spend the night in the Manhattan showroom.

197
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Lights glaring in off the street,

198
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.

199
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.

200
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And you spend a third of your life in bed.

201
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.

202
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

203
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
This was a fun one.

204
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world

205
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and the most expensive production car.

206
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,

207
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
a professional race car driver,

208
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles

209
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.

210
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight

211
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.

212
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And it was really amazing.

213
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It was such a smooth ride.

214
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.

215
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,

216
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."

217
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people

218
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,

219
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
because it was just that smooth.

220
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.

221
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Laughter)

222
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show

223
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.

224
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.

225
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When he tries to open the door,

226
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."

227
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
There was one object that I could not get my hands on,

228
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.

229
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.

230
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux

231
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.

232
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And 1947 was a legendary vintage,

233
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.

234
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura

235
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.

236
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But it's 60 years old.

237
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There's not much of it left.

238
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --

239
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.

240
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Not that many people are looking to pop open

241
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
their one remaining bottle for a journalist.

242
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.

243
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,

244
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and it was coming up empty.

245
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.

246
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist

247
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,

248
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up

249
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."

250
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And it was going to be a double vertical --

251
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,

252
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and 30 vintages of Yquem.

253
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.

254
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I went.

255
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It was three days, four meals.

256
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.

257
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And you know, it had this fragrant softness,

258
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.

259
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And then I tasted it, and it,

260
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,

261
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
which is characteristic of that wine --

262
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.

263
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.

264
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
There were some people who were a little less impressed.

265
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And I wasn't that impressed.

266
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --

267
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,

268
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.

269
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And it wasn't just to that wine.

270
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Any one of the wines served at this tasting,

271
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,

272
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.

273
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But drinking 60 great wines over three days,

274
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they all just blurred together,

275
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and it became almost a grueling experience.

276
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study

277
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.

278
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And they gave subjects the same wine,

279
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
labeled with different price tags.

280
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
A lot of people, you know,

281
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
said that they liked the more expensive wine more --

282
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one

283
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that was more expensive.

284
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did

285
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,

286
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --

287
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure

288
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.

289
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Thank you.

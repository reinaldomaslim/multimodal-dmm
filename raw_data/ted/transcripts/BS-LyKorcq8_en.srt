1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I started juggling a long time ago,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And as a golfer and as a kid,

4
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,

5
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And it's the process of learning things.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.

8
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And he had a real passion for golf,

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and he also created this whole mythology

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about Ben Hogan and various things.

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.

13
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And that was the mythology of skill.

14
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --

16
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.

18
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,

21
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and basically visual music, I guess.

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
OK, you can start the music, thanks.

23
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Music)

24
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Applause)

25
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;

26
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.

27
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.

28
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I do a big piece in a triangle

29
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and these are three sections from it.

30
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space

31
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --

32
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but using the rhythm of my body and feet,

33
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and controlling the balls with my feet.

34
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Applause)

35
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.

36
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.

37
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.

38
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,

39
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it's a process of joining with forces.

40
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out

41
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
how to join with the space through the technique.

42
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
So juggling gravity -- up, down.

43
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you figure out what up and down really are,

44
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it's a complex physical set of skills

45
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,

46
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but then you add in sideways.

47
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

48
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling

49
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands

50
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because you're not looking at your hands,

51
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.

52
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,

53
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with the obvious reference to the feet,

54
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were.

55
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause)

56
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.

57
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I'm going to build towards complexity now.

58
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Juggling three balls is simple and normal.

59
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

60
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Excuse me.

61
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

62
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,

63
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you're getting into a subculture here.

64
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

65
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.

66
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines

67
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.

68
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.

69
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.

70
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.

71
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.

72
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.

73
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, you've got to go after the space down there.

74
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
OK, then you've got to combine them,

75
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.

76
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And then you get crazy.

77
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

78
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,

79
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
so you've got to pay attention. Complexity:

80
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down

81
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
or your skill increases, so your perceptions change.

82
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.

83
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.

84
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.

85
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.

86
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?

87
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.

88
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
OK? And whoever laughed there --

89
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you understood it completely, right?

90
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

91
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,

92
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
who's got his hands around that mess, OK.

93
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?

94
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.

95
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.

96
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
OK? Another way is the outside.

97
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And you could play with the rhythm.

98
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Same pattern.

99
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Make it faster and smaller.

100
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Make it wider.

101
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Make it narrower.

102
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Bring it back up.

103
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
OK. It's done. Thanks.

104
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

105
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.

106
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,

107
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but let's try something.

108
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,

109
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I'm going to give you a little clue.

110
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.

111
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

112
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
You're not getting off that easy. All right?

113
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.

114
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Green.

115
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Yellow.

116
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Pink.

117
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
White.

118
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.

119
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now, let's actually learn something.

120
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.

121
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
You want to do it? Yeah? OK.

122
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together.

123
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What you're going to learn is this.

124
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Laughter)

125
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.

126
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.

127
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Little, ring, middle, index. And then open.

128
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

129
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
A little bit faster.

130
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

131
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

132
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Laughter)

133
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.

134
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

135
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
One learning process that I see is this --

136
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

137
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
OK. Another learning process that I see is this --

138
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Laughter)

139
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.

140
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Now, one more time, and --

141
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.

142
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.

143
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Shake your hands out.

144
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.

145
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,

146
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and you're getting this. OK?

147
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,

148
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.

149
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So what I want you to do is -- fingers.

150
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.

151
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But I want you to do is also, with your eyes,

152
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.

153
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Laughter)

154
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
OK? Here we go.

155
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --

156
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and I'm going to tell you which color,

157
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?

158
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So white ball and --

159
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.

160
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.

161
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.

162
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.

163
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

164
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
All right.

165
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

166
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is

167
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,

168
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
a moment of learning, a moment of challenge.

169
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
It's a moment that you can't make sense of.

170
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Why the hell should I learn this? OK?

171
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?

172
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?

173
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Laughter)

174
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You know, what are you supposed to do?

175
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle

176
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
of doing that for his whole life. OK?

177
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?

178
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?

179
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.

180
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.

181
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,

182
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
a moment. And what I do as a creative artist

183
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.

184
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks

185
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and I put the choreography together,

186
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
but they're not original techniques.

187
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques

188
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that come from the work that I've developed. OK?

189
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So, a moment, how would you define a moment?

190
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something

191
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that was representational of a moment.

192
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Ahhh.

193
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.

194
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So, a moment.

195
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Rattling)

196
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,

197
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
OK, what can I do to make that something

198
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
that is dependent on something else, another dynamic.

199
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Rattling)

200
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
So, a moment.

201
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Rattling)

202
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Another moment.

203
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Rattling)

204
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.

205
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Rattling)

206
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.

207
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Time. How can you look at time?

208
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?

209
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Well, obviously, there's something in here,

210
0:18:51.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and you can all have a guess as to what it is.

211
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.

212
0:18:55.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.

213
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.

214
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,

215
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on

216
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
while I'm keeping time with this.

217
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.

218
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
(Applause)

219
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?

220
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Are we ready to do that? Yes?

221
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
This is the piece that I told you about.

222
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.

223
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Applause)

224
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,

225
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:42,000
you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees

226
0:20:42.33,000 --> 0:20:44,000
at 120 miles an hour?

227
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
(Laughter)

228
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
The only other thing is, it was a real shock.

229
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me

230
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:20:57,000
that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.

231
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Anyway, balance:

232
0:20:59.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
constant movement to find an approach to stillness.

233
0:21:06.33,000 --> 0:21:07,000
Cheating.

234
0:21:07.33,000 --> 0:21:09,000
(Laughter)

235
0:21:10.33,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,

236
0:21:14.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.

237
0:21:25.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.

238
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
(Laughter)

239
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:39,000
Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,

240
0:21:39.33,000 --> 0:21:46,000
and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.

241
0:21:47.33,000 --> 0:21:49,000
So, there's a rhythm to it.

242
0:21:51.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
The rhythm can get much smaller.

243
0:22:01.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,

244
0:22:07.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
those tinier movements. Thanks.

245
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
(Applause)

246
0:22:15.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece

247
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:23,000
that is about balance in some ways, and also --

248
0:22:24.33,000 --> 0:22:3,000
oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.

249
0:22:30.33,000 --> 0:22:39,000
(Laughter)

250
0:22:40.33,000 --> 0:22:43,000
You can go with the "Sticks One" music.

251
0:22:47.33,000 --> 0:24:11,000
(Music)

252
0:24:11.33,000 --> 0:24:18,000
(Applause)

253
0:24:18.33,000 --> 0:24:24,000
Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.

254
0:24:24.33,000 --> 0:24:3,000
I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.

255
0:24:30.33,000 --> 0:24:33,000
And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.

256
0:24:33.33,000 --> 0:24:36,000
"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.

257
0:24:39.33,000 --> 0:24:43,000
Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.

258
0:24:43.33,000 --> 0:25:44,000
(Music)

259
0:25:44.33,000 --> 0:25:46,000
(Applause)

260
0:25:46.33,000 --> 0:25:53,000
Working with space and the lines in space in a different way.

261
0:25:54.33,000 --> 0:25:56,000
Oh, let's see here.

262
0:26:27.33,000 --> 0:26:28,000
(Applause)

263
0:26:29.33,000 --> 0:26:34,000
So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,

264
0:26:34.33,000 --> 0:26:4,000
now, what if you attach something to it, or change it.

265
0:26:41.33,000 --> 0:26:43,000
This is a little thing that I made

266
0:26:43.33,000 --> 0:26:48,000
because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.

267
0:26:49.33,000 --> 0:26:55,000
And then creating space and the rhythm of space,

268
0:26:55.33,000 --> 0:26:59,000
using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.

269
0:27:00.33,000 --> 0:27:04,000
Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,

270
0:27:04.33,000 --> 0:27:06,000
which is --

271
0:27:06.33,000 --> 0:27:13,000
what have I got here? OK. All right.

272
0:27:19.33,000 --> 0:27:2,000
I'm actually leading up to something,

273
0:27:20.33,000 --> 0:27:24,000
the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.

274
0:27:24.33,000 --> 0:27:27,000
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.

275
0:28:13.33,000 --> 0:28:2,000
(Applause)

276
0:28:20.33,000 --> 0:28:23,000
Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --

277
0:28:23.33,000 --> 0:28:25,000
the diameter and the circumference.

278
0:28:26.33,000 --> 0:28:29,000
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way

279
0:28:29.33,000 --> 0:28:32,000
that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.

280
0:28:32.33,000 --> 0:28:37,000
Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice

281
0:28:37.33,000 --> 0:28:39,000
of objects that I try to work with.

282
0:28:39.33,000 --> 0:28:42,000
The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,

283
0:28:42.33,000 --> 0:28:44,000
if you want to get that up --

284
0:28:44.33,000 --> 0:28:51,000
it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,

285
0:28:51.33,000 --> 0:28:56,000
which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay

286
0:28:56.33,000 --> 0:29:,000
with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.

287
0:29:00.33,000 --> 0:29:04,000
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,

288
0:29:04.33,000 --> 0:29:08,000
and the stories that were involved in it,

289
0:29:09.33,000 --> 0:29:13,000
as well as the fact that they protected the contents.

290
0:29:13.33,000 --> 0:29:18,000
The second influence on this piece came from recycling

291
0:29:18.33,000 --> 0:29:21,000
and looking into a tin can recycling bin

292
0:29:21.33,000 --> 0:29:24,000
and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.

293
0:29:24.33,000 --> 0:29:27,000
So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.

294
0:29:27.33,000 --> 0:32:16,000
(Music)

295
0:32:17.33,000 --> 0:32:2,000
(Applause)

296
0:32:20.33,000 --> 0:32:23,000
Talking about geometry and everything,

297
0:32:23.33,000 --> 0:32:28,000
if you take the circle and you split it in half --

298
0:32:28.33,000 --> 0:32:3,000
can you run "S-Curve music?"

299
0:32:30.33,000 --> 0:32:33,000
I'm going to do just a short version of it.

300
0:32:35.33,000 --> 0:32:39,000
Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.

301
0:32:39.33,000 --> 0:34:17,000
(Music)

302
0:34:17.33,000 --> 0:34:24,000
(Applause)

303
0:34:24.33,000 --> 0:34:29,000
Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,

304
0:34:29.33,000 --> 0:34:32,000
and I dance around a small stage so --

305
0:34:32.33,000 --> 0:34:36,000
two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --

306
0:34:36.33,000 --> 0:34:4,000
what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.

307
0:34:40.33,000 --> 0:34:42,000
They're not ideas, they're instincts.

308
0:34:43.33,000 --> 0:34:45,000
And the latest thing that I'm working on --

309
0:34:45.33,000 --> 0:34:5,000
(Clattering) --

310
0:34:51.33,000 --> 0:34:56,000
is something really -- I don't know what it is yet.

311
0:34:56.33,000 --> 0:35:01,000
And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.

312
0:35:02.33,000 --> 0:35:04,000
Well, because then it tells me the truth,

313
0:35:04.33,000 --> 0:35:06,000
instead of me imposing the truth.

314
0:35:07.33,000 --> 0:35:1,000
And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space

315
0:35:10.33,000 --> 0:35:12,000
but also with these curves.

316
0:35:12.33,000 --> 0:35:14,000
And what it involves,

317
0:35:14.33,000 --> 0:35:17,000
and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,

318
0:35:17.33,000 --> 0:35:19,000
but I'll do a little bit of it.

319
0:35:19.33,000 --> 0:35:22,000
It initially started off with me stacking these things,

320
0:35:22.33,000 --> 0:35:27,000
bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,

321
0:35:28.33,000 --> 0:35:34,000
of filling in the space. And then it started changing,

322
0:35:37.33,000 --> 0:35:4,000
and become folding on themselves.

323
0:35:44.33,000 --> 0:35:46,000
And then changing levels.

324
0:35:48.33,000 --> 0:35:51,000
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments,

325
0:35:53.33,000 --> 0:35:56,000
not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.

326
0:35:58.33,000 --> 0:36:04,000
For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.

327
0:36:04.33,000 --> 0:36:06,000
Now, I don't know exactly where it's going,

328
0:36:06.33,000 --> 0:36:08,000
but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.

329
0:36:08.33,000 --> 0:36:11,000
And it's going to change as I go through it.

330
0:36:12.33,000 --> 0:36:14,000
But I really like it, it feels right.

331
0:36:14.33,000 --> 0:36:18,000
This may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,

332
0:36:18.33,000 --> 0:36:22,000
and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,

333
0:36:22.33,000 --> 0:36:25,000
just to see, just to play,

334
0:36:25.33,000 --> 0:36:28,000
because I love all different kinds of things to play with.

335
0:36:28.33,000 --> 0:36:3,000
Let's see here.

336
0:36:30.33,000 --> 0:36:33,000
To work with the positive and negative in a different way.

337
0:36:37.33,000 --> 0:36:39,000
And to change, and to change.

338
0:36:39.33,000 --> 0:36:43,000
So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.

339
0:36:44.33,000 --> 0:36:47,000
We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.

340
0:36:48.33,000 --> 0:36:56,000
(Applause)

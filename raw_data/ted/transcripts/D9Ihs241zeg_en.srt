1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a storyteller.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about what I like to call "the danger of the single story."

4
0:00:22.906,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.

5
0:00:26.318,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My mother says that I started reading at the age of two,

6
0:00:29.651,000 --> 0:00:32,000
although I think four is probably close to the truth.

7
0:00:33.913,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So I was an early reader,

8
0:00:35.748,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and what I read were British and American children's books.

9
0:00:39.866,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was also an early writer,

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and when I began to write, at about the age of seven,

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
stories in pencil with crayon illustrations

12
0:00:48.232,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that my poor mother was obligated to read,

13
0:00:51.788,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading:

14
0:00:55.38,000 --> 0:00:59,000
All my characters were white and blue-eyed,

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
they played in the snow,

16
0:01:02.491,000 --> 0:01:04,000
they ate apples,

17
0:01:04.602,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:06.173,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and they talked a lot about the weather,

19
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:1,000
how lovely it was that the sun had come out.

20
0:01:10.569,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:12.557,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.

22
0:01:15.715,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I had never been outside Nigeria.

23
0:01:19.303,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,

24
0:01:22.588,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and we never talked about the weather,

25
0:01:24.46,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because there was no need to.

26
0:01:26.429,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer,

27
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because the characters in the British books I read

28
0:01:31.565,000 --> 0:01:32,000
drank ginger beer.

29
0:01:33.461,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.

30
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:37.715,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And for many years afterwards,

32
0:01:39.189,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer.

33
0:01:42.636,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But that is another story.

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What this demonstrates, I think,

35
0:01:46.667,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is how impressionable and vulnerable we are

36
0:01:49.545,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in the face of a story,

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
particularly as children.

38
0:01:53.799,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign,

39
0:01:57.593,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I had become convinced that books

40
0:01:59.736,000 --> 0:02:02,000
by their very nature had to have foreigners in them

41
0:02:02.93,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.

42
0:02:07.76,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, things changed when I discovered African books.

43
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There weren't many of them available,

44
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.

45
0:02:16.053,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature.

47
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I realized that people like me,

48
0:02:25.398,000 --> 0:02:27,000
girls with skin the color of chocolate,

49
0:02:27.429,000 --> 0:02:3,000
whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,

50
0:02:30.715,000 --> 0:02:31,000
could also exist in literature.

51
0:02:32.842,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I started to write about things I recognized.

52
0:02:36.897,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, I loved those American and British books I read.

53
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.

54
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But the unintended consequence

55
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was that I did not know that people like me

56
0:02:48.232,000 --> 0:02:49,000
could exist in literature.

57
0:02:50.611,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this:

58
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It saved me from having a single story of what books are.

59
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.

60
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
My father was a professor.

61
0:03:04.545,000 --> 0:03:05,000
My mother was an administrator.

62
0:03:07.529,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so we had, as was the norm,

63
0:03:10.355,000 --> 0:03:14,000
live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.

64
0:03:15.342,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy.

65
0:03:19.262,000 --> 0:03:2,000
His name was Fide.

66
0:03:21.818,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor.

67
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family.

68
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say,

69
0:03:34.804,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing."

70
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.

71
0:03:43.736,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit,

72
0:03:46.657,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket

73
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
made of dyed raffia that his brother had made.

74
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I was startled.

75
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family

76
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
could actually make something.

77
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
All I had heard about them was how poor they were,

78
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor.

79
0:04:09.303,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Their poverty was my single story of them.

80
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria

81
0:04:15.708,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to go to university in the United States.

82
0:04:18.501,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I was 19.

83
0:04:20.581,000 --> 0:04:22,000
My American roommate was shocked by me.

84
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well,

85
0:04:27.77,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and was confused when I said that Nigeria

86
0:04:29.882,000 --> 0:04:31,000
happened to have English as its official language.

87
0:04:33.913,000 --> 0:04:37,000
She asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music,"

88
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and was consequently very disappointed

89
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.

90
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.

92
0:04:49.942,000 --> 0:04:5,000
What struck me was this:

93
0:04:51.222,000 --> 0:04:54,000
She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me.

94
0:04:54.688,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Her default position toward me, as an African,

95
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.

96
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
My roommate had a single story of Africa:

97
0:05:05.783,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a single story of catastrophe.

98
0:05:08.572,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In this single story,

99
0:05:09.882,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way,

100
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
no possibility of feelings more complex than pity,

101
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
no possibility of a connection as human equals.

102
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I must say that before I went to the U.S.,

103
0:05:23.307,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I didn't consciously identify as African.

104
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me.

105
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.

106
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But I did come to embrace this new identity,

107
0:05:35.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and in many ways I think of myself now as African.

108
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country,

109
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight

110
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from Lagos two days ago,

111
0:05:47.469,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight

112
0:05:50.375,000 --> 0:05:54,000
about the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."

113
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:56.636,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African,

115
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I began to understand my roommate's response to me.

116
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If I had not grown up in Nigeria,

117
0:06:06.209,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images,

118
0:06:09.374,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes,

119
0:06:14.57,000 --> 0:06:15,000
beautiful animals,

120
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and incomprehensible people,

121
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS,

122
0:06:21.815,000 --> 0:06:23,000
unable to speak for themselves

123
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.

124
0:06:29.088,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I would see Africans in the same way that I,

125
0:06:31.281,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as a child, had seen Fide's family.

126
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature.

127
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok,

128
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who sailed to west Africa in 1561

129
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and kept a fascinating account of his voyage.

130
0:06:52.363,000 --> 0:06:55,000
After referring to the black Africans as "beasts who have no houses,"

131
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
he writes, "They are also people without heads,

132
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
having their mouth and eyes in their breasts."

133
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, I've laughed every time I've read this.

134
0:07:07.28,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And one must admire the imagination of John Lok.

135
0:07:11.533,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But what is important about his writing

136
0:07:13.423,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is that it represents the beginning

137
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of a tradition of telling African stories in the West:

138
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives,

139
0:07:21.639,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of difference, of darkness,

140
0:07:23.818,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,

141
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
are "half devil, half child."

142
0:07:32.371,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And so, I began to realize that my American roommate

143
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
must have throughout her life

144
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
seen and heard different versions of this single story,

145
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as had a professor,

146
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."

147
0:07:48.029,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, I was quite willing to contend

148
0:07:49.744,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that there were a number of things wrong with the novel,

149
0:07:52.863,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that it had failed in a number of places,

150
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but I had not quite imagined that it had failed

151
0:07:58.423,000 --> 0:08:,000
at achieving something called African authenticity.

152
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was.

153
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The professor told me that my characters were too much like him,

154
0:08:10.58,000 --> 0:08:11,000
an educated and middle-class man.

155
0:08:12.58,000 --> 0:08:14,000
My characters drove cars.

156
0:08:14.706,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They were not starving.

157
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Therefore they were not authentically African.

158
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty

159
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in the question of the single story.

160
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.

161
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense,

162
0:08:33.851,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and there were debates going on about immigration.

163
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And, as often happens in America,

164
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
immigration became synonymous with Mexicans.

165
0:08:42.858,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There were endless stories of Mexicans

166
0:08:44.815,000 --> 0:08:47,000
as people who were fleecing the healthcare system,

167
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
sneaking across the border,

168
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.

169
0:08:54.323,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara,

170
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
watching the people going to work,

171
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,

172
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
smoking, laughing.

173
0:09:05.355,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I remember first feeling slight surprise.

174
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.

175
0:09:11.501,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans

176
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that they had become one thing in my mind,

177
0:09:18.184,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the abject immigrant.

178
0:09:20.929,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I had bought into the single story of Mexicans

179
0:09:23.375,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.

180
0:09:26.231,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So that is how to create a single story,

181
0:09:28.802,000 --> 0:09:3,000
show a people as one thing,

182
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as only one thing,

183
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
over and over again,

184
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and that is what they become.

185
0:09:37.953,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It is impossible to talk about the single story

186
0:09:40.423,000 --> 0:09:41,000
without talking about power.

187
0:09:43.656,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There is a word, an Igbo word,

188
0:09:45.428,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world,

189
0:09:49.103,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it is "nkali."

190
0:09:50.492,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."

191
0:09:55.714,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Like our economic and political worlds,

192
0:09:58.666,000 --> 0:10:02,000
stories too are defined by the principle of nkali:

193
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
How they are told, who tells them,

194
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when they're told, how many stories are told,

195
0:10:08.421,000 --> 0:10:1,000
are really dependent on power.

196
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person,

197
0:10:15.327,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but to make it the definitive story of that person.

198
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes

199
0:10:21.28,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that if you want to dispossess a people,

200
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the simplest way to do it is to tell their story

201
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and to start with, "secondly."

202
0:10:30.644,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans,

203
0:10:34.566,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and not with the arrival of the British,

204
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and you have an entirely different story.

205
0:10:40.161,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Start the story with the failure of the African state,

206
0:10:44.617,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and not with the colonial creation of the African state,

207
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and you have an entirely different story.

208
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I recently spoke at a university

209
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
where a student told me that it was such a shame

210
0:10:57.969,000 --> 0:11:,000
that Nigerian men were physical abusers

211
0:11:01.112,000 --> 0:11:02,000
like the father character in my novel.

212
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I told him that I had just read a novel called "American Psycho" --

213
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

214
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
-- and that it was such a shame

215
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that young Americans were serial murderers.

216
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

217
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Applause)

218
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.

219
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But it would never have occurred to me to think

221
0:11:32.375,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer

222
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that he was somehow representative of all Americans.

223
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is not because I am a better person than that student,

224
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but because of America's cultural and economic power,

225
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I had many stories of America.

226
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.

227
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I did not have a single story of America.

228
0:11:55.831,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When I learned, some years ago,

229
0:11:57.561,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods

230
0:12:01.926,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to be successful,

231
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.

232
0:12:08.184,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

233
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood,

234
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.

235
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.

236
0:12:20.91,000 --> 0:12:24,000
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.

237
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash

238
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because our fire trucks did not have water.

239
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I grew up under repressive military governments

240
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that devalued education,

241
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries.

242
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,

243
0:12:43.161,000 --> 0:12:45,000
then margarine disappeared,

244
0:12:45.682,000 --> 0:12:47,000
then bread became too expensive,

245
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
then milk became rationed.

246
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear

247
0:12:54.841,000 --> 0:12:55,000
invaded our lives.

248
0:12:57.983,000 --> 0:12:59,000
All of these stories make me who I am.

249
0:13:00.617,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But to insist on only these negative stories

250
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is to flatten my experience

251
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and to overlook the many other stories that formed me.

252
0:13:11.554,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The single story creates stereotypes,

253
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,

254
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but that they are incomplete.

255
0:13:21.517,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They make one story become the only story.

256
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Of course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes:

257
0:13:27.756,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo

258
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and depressing ones,

259
0:13:32.81,000 --> 0:13:36,000
such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria.

260
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe,

261
0:13:41.747,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.

262
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I've always felt that it is impossible

263
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to engage properly with a place or a person

264
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.

265
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The consequence of the single story is this:

266
0:13:57.764,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It robs people of dignity.

267
0:14:00.492,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.

268
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.

269
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So what if before my Mexican trip,

270
0:14:11.673,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I had followed the immigration debate from both sides,

271
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the U.S. and the Mexican?

272
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor

273
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and hardworking?

274
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
What if we had an African television network

275
0:14:25.28,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?

276
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls "a balance of stories."

277
0:14:33.515,000 --> 0:14:36,000
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher,

278
0:14:37.515,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Muhtar Bakare,

279
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
a remarkable man who left his job in a bank

280
0:14:41.232,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to follow his dream and start a publishing house?

281
0:14:44.161,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.

282
0:14:47.872,000 --> 0:14:48,000
He disagreed.

283
0:14:49.15,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He felt that people who could read, would read,

284
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
if you made literature affordable and available to them.

285
0:14:56.826,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Shortly after he published my first novel,

286
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview,

287
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said,

288
0:15:05.375,000 --> 0:15:07,000
"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending.

289
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."

290
0:15:11.423,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Laughter)

291
0:15:14.161,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.

292
0:15:17.724,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.

293
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians,

294
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
who were not supposed to be readers.

295
0:15:26.061,000 --> 0:15:27,000
She had not only read the book,

296
0:15:27.709,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but she had taken ownership of it

297
0:15:29.542,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.

298
0:15:33.74,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda,

299
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos,

300
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?

301
0:15:43.855,000 --> 0:15:46,000
What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure

302
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?

303
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,

304
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
talented people singing in English and Pidgin,

305
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,

306
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela

307
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.

308
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer

309
0:16:08.423,000 --> 0:16:11,000
who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law

310
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that required women to get their husband's consent

311
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
before renewing their passports?

312
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,

313
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds,

314
0:16:25.564,000 --> 0:16:26,000
films so popular

315
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?

316
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,

317
0:16:35.47,000 --> 0:16:38,000
who has just started her own business selling hair extensions?

318
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail,

319
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but continue to nurse ambition?

320
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Every time I am home I am confronted

321
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians:

322
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
our failed infrastructure, our failed government,

323
0:16:55.628,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but also by the incredible resilience

324
0:16:57.707,000 --> 0:17:,000
of people who thrive despite the government,

325
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
rather than because of it.

326
0:17:03.533,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer,

327
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and it is amazing to me how many people apply,

328
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
how many people are eager to write,

329
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to tell stories.

330
0:17:14.435,000 --> 0:17:17,000
My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit

331
0:17:17.482,000 --> 0:17:18,000
called Farafina Trust,

332
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and we have big dreams of building libraries

333
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and refurbishing libraries that already exist

334
0:17:24.327,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and providing books for state schools

335
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that don't have anything in their libraries,

336
0:17:29.28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops,

337
0:17:31.685,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in reading and writing,

338
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.

339
0:17:36.486,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Stories matter.

340
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Many stories matter.

341
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign,

342
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.

343
0:17:48.802,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Stories can break the dignity of a people,

344
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
but stories can also repair that broken dignity.

345
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
The American writer Alice Walker wrote this

346
0:17:58.232,000 --> 0:18:01,000
about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North.

347
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
She introduced them to a book about

348
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the Southern life that they had left behind.

349
0:18:07.752,000 --> 0:18:1,000
"They sat around, reading the book themselves,

350
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."

351
0:18:17.739,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I would like to end with this thought:

352
0:18:20.625,000 --> 0:18:22,000
That when we reject the single story,

353
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
when we realize that there is never a single story

354
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
about any place,

355
0:18:28.625,000 --> 0:18:29,000
we regain a kind of paradise.

356
0:18:30.855,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Thank you.

357
0:18:32.001,000 --> 0:18:35,000
(Applause)

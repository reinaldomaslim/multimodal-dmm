1
0:00:12.583,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The Earth needs no introduction.

2
0:00:15.786,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts,

3
0:00:20.596,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972,

4
0:00:23.324,000 --> 0:00:27,000
took this iconic image.

5
0:00:27.396,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It galvanized a whole generation of human beings

6
0:00:30.875,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to realize that we're on Spaceship Earth,

7
0:00:33.553,000 --> 0:00:35,000
fragile and finite as it is,

8
0:00:35.84,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and that we need to take care of it.

9
0:00:37.643,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But while this picture is beautiful, it's static,

10
0:00:40.624,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and the Earth is constantly changing.

11
0:00:43.177,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's changing on days' time scales with human activity.

12
0:00:46.676,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the satellite imagery we have of it today is old.

13
0:00:49.975,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Typically, years old.

14
0:00:52.47,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And that's important because you can't fix what you can't see.

15
0:00:56.735,000 --> 0:01:,000
What we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day.

16
0:01:01.595,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, what's standing in our way?

17
0:01:03.871,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What's the problem?

18
0:01:05.882,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This is the problem:

19
0:01:07.908,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Satellites are big, expensive and they're slow.

20
0:01:12.191,000 --> 0:01:14,000
This one weighs three tons.

21
0:01:14.332,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's six meters tall, four meters wide.

22
0:01:17.097,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it.

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
One satellite, one rocket.

24
0:01:22.18,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It cost 855 million dollars.

25
0:01:25.38,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Satellites like these have done an amazing job

26
0:01:27.614,000 --> 0:01:3,000
at helping us to understand our planet.

27
0:01:30.73,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But if we want to understand it much more regularly,

28
0:01:34.356,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we need lots of satellites,

29
0:01:36.402,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and this model isn't scalable.

30
0:01:38.373,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So me and my friends, we started Planet Labs

31
0:01:40.476,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to make satellites ultra-compact

32
0:01:42.562,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and small and highly capable.

33
0:01:44.849,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm going to show you what our satellite looks like:

34
0:01:52.363,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is our satellite.

35
0:01:54.9,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This is not a scale model,

36
0:01:56.863,000 --> 0:01:57,000
this is the real size.

37
0:01:58.371,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,

38
0:02:00.757,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it weighs four kilograms,

39
0:02:03.046,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and we've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics

40
0:02:05.583,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and sensor systems into this little package

41
0:02:07.84,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so that even though this is really small,

42
0:02:09.884,000 --> 0:02:14,000
this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here,

43
0:02:14.977,000 --> 0:02:18,000
even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass.

44
0:02:19.387,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we call this satellite "Dove" — Thank you.

45
0:02:23.14,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:25.435,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We call this satellite "Dove,"

47
0:02:27.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and we call it "Dove" because satellites are typically named

48
0:02:30.499,000 --> 0:02:32,000
after birds, but normally birds of prey:

49
0:02:32.865,000 --> 0:02:34,000
like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, Kill, I don't know,

50
0:02:35.702,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Kestrel, these sort of things.

51
0:02:37.417,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But ours have a humanitarian mission,

52
0:02:39.342,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so we wanted to call them Doves.

53
0:02:41.175,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And we haven't just built them, though.

54
0:02:43.109,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We've launched them.

55
0:02:44.45,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And not just one, but many.

56
0:02:50.586,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It all started in our garage.

57
0:02:52.953,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Yes, we built our first satellite prototype in our garage.

58
0:02:55.767,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are,

59
0:02:58.984,000 --> 0:03:,000
but we believe it's the first time for a space company.

60
0:03:01.927,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley.

61
0:03:05.395,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We rapidly prototype our satellites.

62
0:03:08.587,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We use "release early, release often" on our software.

63
0:03:11.472,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And we take a different risk approach.

64
0:03:13.389,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We take them outside and test them.

65
0:03:15.392,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites,

66
0:03:18.281,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale.

67
0:03:21.144,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We've used modern production techniques

68
0:03:23.21,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so we can build large numbers of them,

69
0:03:25.923,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I think for the first time.

70
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We call it agile aerospace,

71
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box.

72
0:03:36.808,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, what has bonded our team over the years

73
0:03:41.3,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information.

74
0:03:46.436,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In fact, the founders of our company, Chris, Robbie and I,

75
0:03:49.221,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we met over 15 years ago at the United Nations

76
0:03:51.526,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when they were hosting a conference about exactly that question:

77
0:03:54.511,000 --> 0:03:55,000
How do you use satellites to help humanity?

78
0:03:56.18,000 --> 0:03:57,000
How do you use satellites to help people in developing countries

79
0:03:57.932,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or with climate change?

80
0:03:59.939,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And this is what has bonded us.

81
0:04:02.405,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity.

82
0:04:06.97,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You could say we're space geeks,

83
0:04:08.747,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but not only do we care about what's up there,

84
0:04:11.284,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we care about what's down here, too.

85
0:04:13.376,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I'm going to show you a video

86
0:04:15.102,000 --> 0:04:17,000
from just four weeks ago of two of our satellites

87
0:04:17.561,000 --> 0:04:19,000
being launched from the International Space Station.

88
0:04:20.45,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is not an animation,

89
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window.

90
0:04:25.49,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites.

91
0:04:28.479,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's like some of the smallest satellites ever

92
0:04:30.796,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are being launched from the biggest satellite ever.

93
0:04:33.29,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And right at the end, the solar array glints in the sun.

94
0:04:35.872,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's really cool. Wait for it.

95
0:04:38.241,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.

96
0:04:41.854,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:43.864,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So we didn't just launch two of them like this,

98
0:04:46.875,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we launched 28 of them.

99
0:04:48.601,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history,

100
0:04:52.214,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set

101
0:04:55.463,000 --> 0:04:57,000
about our changing planet.

102
0:04:57.467,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But that's just the beginning.

103
0:04:59.695,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You see, we're going to launch more than 100 of these satellites

104
0:05:02.777,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like these over the course of the next year.

105
0:05:05.031,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history.

106
0:05:08.68,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And this is what it's going to do:

107
0:05:10.337,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Acting in a single-orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun,

108
0:05:13.896,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the Earth rotates underneath.

109
0:05:15.569,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They're all cameras pointed down,

110
0:05:17.864,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they slowly scan across as the Earth rotates underneath.

111
0:05:20.833,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The Earth rotates every 24 hours,

112
0:05:22.957,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so we scan every point on the planet every 24 hours.

113
0:05:25.929,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's a line scanner for the planet.

114
0:05:28.18,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We don't take a picture of anywhere on the planet every day,

115
0:05:31.634,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day.

116
0:05:34.82,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago,

117
0:05:37.513,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites

118
0:05:40.278,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now.

119
0:05:43.694,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is the very first picture taken by our satellite.

120
0:05:46.504,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It happened to be over UC-Davis' campus

121
0:05:48.5,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in California when we turned the camera on.

122
0:05:50.544,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But what's even cooler is when

123
0:05:52.073,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we compare it to the previous latest image of that area,

124
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which was taken many months ago.

125
0:05:57.609,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And the image on the left is from our satellite,

126
0:06:00.174,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we see buildings are being built.

127
0:06:02.221,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens

128
0:06:06.21,000 --> 0:06:09,000
around the whole world in all cities, every day.

129
0:06:10.052,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Water as well.

130
0:06:11.579,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Thank you.

131
0:06:13.42,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:14.987,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies

133
0:06:17.609,000 --> 0:06:2,000
around the whole world every day and help water security.

134
0:06:20.82,000 --> 0:06:22,000
From water security to food security.

135
0:06:22.992,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We'll see crops as they grow in all the fields

136
0:06:25.495,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in every farmer's field around the planet every day.

137
0:06:28.52,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and help them to improve crop yield.

138
0:06:31.423,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This is a beautiful image that was taken

139
0:06:33.562,000 --> 0:06:37,000
just a few hours ago when the satellite was flying over Argentina.

140
0:06:37.68,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The general point is

141
0:06:39.104,000 --> 0:06:42,000
there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data,

142
0:06:42.517,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I've mentioned a few, but there's others:

143
0:06:44.469,000 --> 0:06:45,000
deforestation, the ice caps melting.

144
0:06:46.193,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We can track all of these things, every tree on the planet every day.

145
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image,

146
0:06:52.598,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you'd see much of the world news — you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.

147
0:06:56.674,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we have decided, therefore, that the best thing that we could do with our data

148
0:07:00.283,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is to ensure universal access to it.

149
0:07:03.275,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We want to ensure everyone can see it.

150
0:07:05.4,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Thank you. (Applause)

151
0:07:08.979,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We want to empower NGOs and companies and scientists and journalists

152
0:07:12.78,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet.

153
0:07:16.254,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data.

154
0:07:21.413,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In short, we want to democratize access to information about our planet.

155
0:07:25.511,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Which brings me back to this.

156
0:07:28.311,000 --> 0:07:32,000
You see, this will be an entirely new global data set.

157
0:07:32.874,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And we believe that together,

158
0:07:34.801,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we can help to take care of our Spaceship Earth.

159
0:07:39.384,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And what I would like to leave you with is the following question:

160
0:07:42.899,000 --> 0:07:46,000
If you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day,

161
0:07:47.17,000 --> 0:07:48,000
what would you do with that data?

162
0:07:48.804,000 --> 0:07:49,000
What problems would you solve?

163
0:07:50.412,000 --> 0:07:51,000
What exploration would you do?

164
0:07:52.382,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Well, I invite you to come and explore with us.

165
0:07:54.474,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Thank you very much.

166
0:07:56.08,000 --> 0:08:28,000

1
0:00:12.786,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.

2
0:00:16.781,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My father has just built the best outhouse

3
0:00:20.34,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in our little village in Ukraine.

4
0:00:22.93,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground,

5
0:00:26.479,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but outside, it's pearly white formica

6
0:00:30.485,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and it literally gleams in the sun.

7
0:00:34.113,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This makes me feel so proud, so important,

8
0:00:37.67,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends

9
0:00:40.71,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I devise missions for us.

10
0:00:43.49,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So we prowl from house to house

11
0:00:45.803,000 --> 0:00:48,000
looking for flies captured in spider webs

12
0:00:49.17,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we set them free.

13
0:00:51.557,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Four years earlier, when I was one,

14
0:00:53.865,000 --> 0:00:54,000
after the Chernobyl accident,

15
0:00:55.31,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the rain came down black,

16
0:00:57.641,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,

17
0:00:59.841,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I spent nine months in the hospital.

18
0:01:02.398,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There were no visitors allowed,

19
0:01:03.95,000 --> 0:01:06,000
so my mother bribed a hospital worker.

20
0:01:07.962,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She acquired a nurse's uniform,

21
0:01:10.693,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and she snuck in every night to sit by my side.

22
0:01:15.038,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Five years later, an unexpected silver lining.

23
0:01:18.098,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Thanks to Chernobyl, we get asylum in the U.S.

24
0:01:22.2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I am six years old, and I don't cry when we leave home

25
0:01:26.419,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and we come to America,

26
0:01:27.47,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because I expect it to be a place filled with rare

27
0:01:31.218,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate

28
0:01:35.398,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and Bazooka bubble gum,

29
0:01:37.839,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside,

30
0:01:41.932,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine

31
0:01:45.049,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week.

32
0:01:49.085,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So the first day we get to New York,

33
0:01:50.891,000 --> 0:01:52,000
my grandmother and I find a penny

34
0:01:53.124,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in.

35
0:01:56.867,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Only, we don't know that it's a homeless shelter.

36
0:01:58.402,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We think that it's a hotel, a hotel with lots of rats.

37
0:02:01.493,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor,

38
0:02:06.075,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there

39
0:02:09.071,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because regular people don't just lose money.

40
0:02:11.565,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand,

41
0:02:14.122,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it's sticky and rusty,

42
0:02:16.784,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.

43
0:02:19.815,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece

44
0:02:22.125,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of Bazooka bubble gum.

45
0:02:23.94,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And in that moment, I feel like a millionaire.

46
0:02:27.925,000 --> 0:02:29,000
About a year later, I get to feel that way again

47
0:02:30.235,000 --> 0:02:32,000
when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash,

48
0:02:32.994,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and suddenly I have more toys

49
0:02:34.725,000 --> 0:02:36,000
than I've ever had in my whole life.

50
0:02:37.469,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock

51
0:02:39.854,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,

52
0:02:41.831,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and my sister and I find a deliveryman

53
0:02:44.14,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with a box of pizza that we didn't order.

54
0:02:46.693,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So we take the pizza, our very first pizza,

55
0:02:49.882,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we devour slice after slice

56
0:02:52.721,000 --> 0:02:55,000
as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway.

57
0:02:56.11,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And he tells us to pay, but we don't speak English.

58
0:02:59.11,000 --> 0:03:01,000
My mother comes out, and he asks her for money,

59
0:03:01.538,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but she doesn't have enough.

60
0:03:02.896,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day

61
0:03:06.248,000 --> 0:03:08,000
just to avoid spending money on bus fare.

62
0:03:08.917,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Then our neighbor pops her head in,

63
0:03:10.783,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and she turns red with rage when she realizes

64
0:03:13.373,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that those immigrants from downstairs

65
0:03:15.719,000 --> 0:03:18,000
have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.

66
0:03:19.728,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Everyone's upset.

67
0:03:21.284,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But the pizza is delicious.

68
0:03:25.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had.

69
0:03:31.086,000 --> 0:03:33,000
On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U.S.,

70
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we decided to celebrate by reserving a room

71
0:03:35.508,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S.

72
0:03:38.39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The man at the front desk laughs, and he says,

73
0:03:40.809,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter."

74
0:03:43.691,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And we were shocked.

75
0:03:45.828,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid.

76
0:03:49.834,000 --> 0:03:52,000
His family lost everything, and at age 11,

77
0:03:52.924,000 --> 0:03:54,000
he had to live in motels with his dad,

78
0:03:55.677,000 --> 0:03:57,000
motels that would round up all of their food

79
0:03:58.61,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill.

80
0:04:02.29,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And one time, when he finally got his box

81
0:04:04.495,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling with roaches.

82
0:04:08.091,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But he did have one thing.

83
0:04:10.007,000 --> 0:04:12,000
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere

84
0:04:12.651,000 --> 0:04:14,000
containing nine comic books,

85
0:04:15.114,000 --> 0:04:18,000
two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man

86
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and five Gobots. And this was his treasure.

87
0:04:21.323,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This was his own assembly of heroes

88
0:04:24.318,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that kept him from drugs and gangs

89
0:04:26.521,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and from giving up on his dreams.

90
0:04:29.317,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I'm going to tell you about one more

91
0:04:30.365,000 --> 0:04:32,000
formerly homeless member of our family.

92
0:04:33.156,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This is Scarlett.

93
0:04:34.855,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights.

94
0:04:37.924,000 --> 0:04:39,000
She was tied up and thrown into the ring

95
0:04:40.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight.

96
0:04:44.376,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And now, these days, she eats organic food

97
0:04:48.616,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it,

98
0:04:51.307,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but when we pour water for her in her bowl,

99
0:04:55.559,000 --> 0:04:58,000
she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude.

100
0:04:59.548,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett,

101
0:05:02.766,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and she rolls through the grass,

102
0:05:05.185,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and we just look at her

103
0:05:07.586,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and then we look at each other

104
0:05:09.406,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we feel gratitude.

105
0:05:13.413,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations

106
0:05:17.044,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and disappointments,

107
0:05:18.919,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we feel like millionaires.

108
0:05:21.603,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Thank you.

109
0:05:22.753,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Applause)

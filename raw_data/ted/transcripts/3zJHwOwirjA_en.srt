1
0:00:13.349,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was in high school at the age of 17 --

2
0:00:15.562,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I graduated from high school in Decatur, Georgia,

3
0:00:19.269,000 --> 0:00:21,000
as valedictorian of my high school --

4
0:00:21.952,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was very proud of myself.

5
0:00:23.47,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was from a low-income community, I had grown up in Mississippi,

6
0:00:26.807,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia

7
0:00:28.659,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so my parents could pursue their degrees as United Methodist ministers.

8
0:00:34.469,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We were poor, but they didn't think we were poor enough,

9
0:00:37.136,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so they were going for permanent poverty.

10
0:00:39.136,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:40.427,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And so, while they studied at Emory,

12
0:00:42.387,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I studied at Avondale, and I became valedictorian.

13
0:00:45.989,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, one of the joys of being valedictorian in the state of Georgia

14
0:00:49.263,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is that you get invited to meet the governor of Georgia.

15
0:00:52.72,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was mildly interested in meeting him.

16
0:00:56.482,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was kind of cool.

17
0:00:57.696,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion,

18
0:01:01.229,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because I watched a lot of "General Hospital" and "Dynasty"

19
0:01:04.049,000 --> 0:01:05,000
as a child.

20
0:01:05.23,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:06.904,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And so I got up that morning, ready to go to visit the governor.

22
0:01:10.958,000 --> 0:01:13,000
My mom and my dad, who were also invited, got up,

23
0:01:14.18,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we went outside.

24
0:01:15.466,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But we didn't get in our car.

25
0:01:17.355,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And in the south, a car is a necessary thing.

26
0:01:20.631,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We don't have a lot of public transit, there aren't a lot of options.

27
0:01:23.998,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But if you're lucky enough to live in a community

28
0:01:26.355,000 --> 0:01:27,000
where you don't have a car,

29
0:01:27.681,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the only option is public transit.

30
0:01:29.831,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And that's what we had to take.

31
0:01:32.006,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so we got on the bus.

32
0:01:33.839,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And we took the bus from Decatur all the way to Buckhead,

33
0:01:37.284,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where the Governor's Mansion sat on this really beautiful acreage of land,

34
0:01:41.704,000 --> 0:01:44,000
with these long black gates that ran the length of the property.

35
0:01:45.101,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We get to the Governor's Mansion,

36
0:01:46.721,000 --> 0:01:48,000
we pull the little lever that lets them know this is our stop,

37
0:01:49.712,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we get off the bus,

38
0:01:50.911,000 --> 0:01:52,000
my mom, my dad and I, we walk across the street.

39
0:01:53.609,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We walk up the driveway, because there are cars coming up,

40
0:01:56.752,000 --> 0:01:58,000
cars bringing in students from all across the state of Georgia.

41
0:01:59.765,000 --> 0:02:,000
So we're walking along the side.

42
0:02:01.398,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And as we walk single file along the side,

43
0:02:03.5,000 --> 0:02:06,000
my mom and dad sandwiching me to make sure I don't get hit by one of the cars

44
0:02:07.161,000 --> 0:02:08,000
bringing in the other valedictorians,

45
0:02:08.994,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we approach the guard gate.

46
0:02:10.867,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When we get to the guard gate, the guard comes out.

47
0:02:13.283,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He looks at me, and he looks at my parents,

48
0:02:16.177,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and he says, "You don't belong here, this is a private event."

49
0:02:19.839,000 --> 0:02:22,000
My dad says, "No, this is my daughter, Stacey. She's one of the valedictorians."

50
0:02:24.109,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But the guard doesn't look at the checklist that's in his hands.

51
0:02:27.3,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He doesn't ask my mom for the invitation

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that's at the bottom of her very voluminous purse.

53
0:02:32.228,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Instead, he looks over our shoulder at the bus,

54
0:02:34.641,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because in his mind, the bus is telling him a story about who should be there.

55
0:02:39.3,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the fact that we were too poor to have our own car --

56
0:02:42.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that was a story he told himself.

57
0:02:45.061,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And he may have seen something in my skin color,

58
0:02:47.347,000 --> 0:02:48,000
he may have seen something in my attire;

59
0:02:49.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I don't know what went through his mind.

60
0:02:51.244,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But his conclusion was to look at me again,

61
0:02:53.766,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and with a look of disdain, say,

62
0:02:55.381,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"I told you, this is a private event. You don't belong here."

63
0:02:59.355,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, my parents were studying to become United Methodist ministers,

64
0:03:02.611,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but they were not pastors yet.

65
0:03:04.651,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:07.04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so they proceeded to engage this gentleman

67
0:03:10.048,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in a very robust discussion of his decision-making skills.

68
0:03:13.02,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:14.405,000 --> 0:03:15,000
My father may have mentioned

70
0:03:15.866,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that he was going to spend eternity in a very fiery place

71
0:03:18.588,000 --> 0:03:2,000
if he didn't find my name on that checklist.

72
0:03:21.215,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And indeed, the man checks the checklist eventually,

73
0:03:23.954,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and he found my name, and he let us inside.

74
0:03:26.927,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But I don't remember meeting the governor of Georgia.

75
0:03:30.006,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I don't recall meeting my fellow valedictorians

76
0:03:32.657,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from 180 school districts.

77
0:03:34.577,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The only clear memory I have of that day

78
0:03:36.741,000 --> 0:03:39,000
was a man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia,

79
0:03:39.903,000 --> 0:03:42,000
looking at me and telling me I don't belong.

80
0:03:43.776,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And so I decided, 20-some-odd years later,

81
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to be the person who got to open the gates.

82
0:03:50.085,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Cheers)

83
0:03:53.624,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

84
0:03:59.14,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Unfortunately, you may have read the rest of the story.

85
0:04:01.807,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It didn't quite work out that way.

86
0:04:03.568,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And now I'm tasked with figuring out: How do I move forward?

87
0:04:07.953,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women

88
0:04:11.567,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who had been underestimated and told they don't belong.

89
0:04:14.374,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I wanted to open those gates for Latinas and for Asian Americans.

90
0:04:18.387,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I wanted to open those gates for the undocumented and the documented.

91
0:04:22.52,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community.

92
0:04:25.961,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I wanted to open those gates

93
0:04:27.338,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for the families that have to call themselves the victims of gun violence.

94
0:04:30.879,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I wanted to open those gates wide for everyone in Georgia,

95
0:04:33.673,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because that is our state, and this is our nation,

96
0:04:36.059,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and we all belong here.

97
0:04:38.085,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Cheers)

98
0:04:40.529,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

99
0:04:46.006,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what I recognized is that the first try wasn't enough.

100
0:04:50.966,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And my question became: How do I move forward?

101
0:04:53.53,000 --> 0:04:58,000
How do I get beyond the bitterness and the sadness and the lethargy

102
0:04:59.165,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and watching an inordinate amount of television as I eat ice cream?

103
0:05:03.244,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:04.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
What do I do next?

105
0:05:07.498,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I'm going to do what I've always done.

106
0:05:10.173,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I'm going to move forward, because going backwards isn't an option

107
0:05:13.348,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and standing still is not enough.

108
0:05:15.673,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

109
0:05:20.206,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You see, I began my race for governor

110
0:05:23.397,000 --> 0:05:26,000
by analyzing who I was and what I wanted to be.

111
0:05:26.617,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And there are three questions I ask myself about everything I do,

112
0:05:29.72,000 --> 0:05:31,000
whether it's running for office or starting a business;

113
0:05:32.339,000 --> 0:05:34,000
when I decided to start the New Georgia Project

114
0:05:34.577,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to register people to vote;

115
0:05:35.942,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or when I started the latest action, Fair Fight Georgia.

116
0:05:39.315,000 --> 0:05:41,000
No matter what I do, I ask myself three questions:

117
0:05:42.056,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What do I want?

118
0:05:43.357,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Why do I want it?

119
0:05:45.049,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And how do I get it?

120
0:05:47.048,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And in this case, I know what I want.

121
0:05:49.594,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I want change.

122
0:05:51.387,000 --> 0:05:52,000
That is what I want.

123
0:05:52.723,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But the question is:

124
0:05:55.109,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What change do I want to see?

125
0:05:57.656,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are:

126
0:06:00.349,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One, am I honest about the scope of my ambition?

127
0:06:03.744,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Because it's easy to figure out that once you didn't get what you wanted,

128
0:06:07.236,000 --> 0:06:09,000
then maybe you should have set your sights a little lower,

129
0:06:10.025,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but I'm here to tell you to be aggressive about your ambition.

130
0:06:12.997,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Do not allow setbacks to set you back.

131
0:06:15.53,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:21.022,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Number two, let yourself understand your mistakes.

133
0:06:25.323,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But also understand their mistakes,

134
0:06:27.506,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because, as women in particular,

135
0:06:29.077,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we're taught that if something doesn't work out,

136
0:06:31.353,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it's probably our fault.

137
0:06:32.601,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And usually, there is something we could do better,

138
0:06:35.022,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but we've been told not to investigate too much

139
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what the other side could have done.

140
0:06:39.022,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this isn't partisan -- it's people.

141
0:06:40.938,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We're too often told that our mistakes are ours alone,

142
0:06:43.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but victory is a shared benefit.

143
0:06:46.331,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And so what I tell you to do is understand your mistakes,

144
0:06:49.11,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but understand the mistakes of others.

145
0:06:51.608,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And be clearheaded about it.

146
0:06:53.623,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And be honest with yourself and honest with those who support you.

147
0:06:58.108,000 --> 0:07:,000
But once you know what you want,

148
0:07:00.37,000 --> 0:07:01,000
understand why you want it.

149
0:07:02.647,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And even though it feels good, revenge is not a good reason.

150
0:07:05.818,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:08.357,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Instead, make sure you want it

152
0:07:10.458,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because there's something not that you should do,

153
0:07:13.945,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but something you must do.

154
0:07:16.383,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It has to be something that doesn't allow you to sleep at night

155
0:07:19.415,000 --> 0:07:2,000
unless you're dreaming about it;

156
0:07:20.971,000 --> 0:07:23,000
something that wakes you up in the morning and gets you excited about it;

157
0:07:24.455,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or something that makes you so angry,

158
0:07:26.319,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you know you have to do something about it.

159
0:07:28.891,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But know why you're doing it.

160
0:07:31.034,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And know why it must be done.

161
0:07:34.074,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You've listened to women from across this world

162
0:07:37.177,000 --> 0:07:39,000
talk about why things have to happen.

163
0:07:39.774,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But figure out what the "why" is for you,

164
0:07:41.809,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because jumping from the "what" to the "do"

165
0:07:44.822,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is meaningless if you don't know why.

166
0:07:47.377,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Because when it gets hard, when it gets tough,

167
0:07:50.204,000 --> 0:07:52,000
when your friends walk away from you,

168
0:07:52.387,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when your supporters forget you,

169
0:07:54.546,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when you don't win your first race --

170
0:07:57.18,000 --> 0:07:59,000
if you don't know why, you can't try again.

171
0:08:00.363,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So, first know what you want.

172
0:08:02.427,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Second, know why you want it,

173
0:08:04.474,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but third, know how you're going to get it done.

174
0:08:07.323,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I faced a few obstacles in this race.

175
0:08:09.625,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:11.593,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Just a few.

177
0:08:13.09,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But in the pursuit,

178
0:08:14.32,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor

179
0:08:18.557,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in the history of the United States of America for a major party.

180
0:08:22.612,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Cheers)

181
0:08:26.653,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Applause)

182
0:08:30.839,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But more importantly, in this process,

183
0:08:33.482,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we turned out 1.2 million African American voters in Georgia.

184
0:08:37.768,000 --> 0:08:38,000
That is more voters

185
0:08:39.015,000 --> 0:08:42,000
than voted on the Democratic side of the ticket in 2014.

186
0:08:42.958,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Applause)

187
0:08:47.442,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos

188
0:08:49.99,000 --> 0:08:51,000
who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia.

189
0:08:52.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We tripled the number of Asian Americans

190
0:08:54.78,000 --> 0:08:56,000
who stood up and said, "This is our state, too."

191
0:08:57.45,000 --> 0:09:,000
Those are successes that tell me how I can get it done.

192
0:09:01.299,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But they also let me understand the obstacles aren't insurmountable.

193
0:09:04.736,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They're just a little high.

194
0:09:07.156,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But I also understand

195
0:09:08.743,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that there are three things that always hold us hostage.

196
0:09:12.649,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The first is finances.

197
0:09:15.822,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, you may have heard, I'm in a little bit of debt.

198
0:09:18.958,000 --> 0:09:2,000
If you didn't hear about it, you did not go outside.

199
0:09:21.641,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:23.712,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And finances are something that holds us back so often,

201
0:09:26.633,000 --> 0:09:29,000
our dreams are bounded by how much we have in resources.

202
0:09:30.822,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But we hear again and again

203
0:09:32.196,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the stories of those who overcome those resource challenges.

204
0:09:36.744,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But you can't overcome something you don't talk about.

205
0:09:39.554,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And that's why I didn't allow them to debt-shame me in my campaign.

206
0:09:43.569,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I didn't allow anyone to tell me that my lack of opportunity

207
0:09:47.863,000 --> 0:09:49,000
was a reason to disqualify me from running.

208
0:09:50.141,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And believe me, people tried to tell me I shouldn't run.

209
0:09:52.927,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Friends told me not to run.

210
0:09:54.808,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Allies told me not to run.

211
0:09:56.899,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"USA Today" mentioned maybe I shouldn't run.

212
0:09:59.804,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:01.05,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But no matter who it was,

214
0:10:02.361,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I understood that finances are often a reason we don't let ourselves dream.

215
0:10:07.759,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I can't say that you will always overcome those obstacles,

216
0:10:10.594,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but I will tell you, you will be damned if you do not try.

217
0:10:14.482,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Applause)

218
0:10:19.615,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The second is fear.

219
0:10:21.512,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And fear is real.

220
0:10:23.267,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It is paralyzing.

221
0:10:24.749,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It is terrifying.

222
0:10:26.433,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But it can also be energizing,

223
0:10:28.919,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because once you know what you're afraid of,

224
0:10:31.052,000 --> 0:10:33,000
you can figure out how to get around it.

225
0:10:33.403,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the third is fatigue.

226
0:10:35.942,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Sometimes you just get tired of trying.

227
0:10:39.314,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You get tired of reading about processes and politics

228
0:10:43.169,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the things that stop you from getting where you want to be.

229
0:10:46.774,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Sometimes, fatigue means that we accept position instead of power.

230
0:10:51.44,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We let someone give us a title as a consolation prize,

231
0:10:54.456,000 --> 0:10:57,000
rather than realizing we know what we want and we're going to get it,

232
0:10:57.741,000 --> 0:10:58,000
even if we're tired.

233
0:10:58.923,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's why God created naps.

234
0:11:00.646,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:03.472,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But we also learn in those moments

236
0:11:05.853,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much we want it.

237
0:11:11.641,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Because if you are beaten down,

238
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:16,000
if you have worked as hard as you can,

239
0:11:16.974,000 --> 0:11:18,000
if you have done everything you said you should,

240
0:11:19.713,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and it still doesn't work out,

241
0:11:21.31,000 --> 0:11:23,000
fatigue can sap you of your energy.

242
0:11:24.863,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But that's why you go back to the "why" of it.

243
0:11:28.156,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Because I know we have to have women who speak for the voiceless.

244
0:11:32.113,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I know we have to have people of good conscience

245
0:11:34.502,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who stand up against oppression.

246
0:11:36.938,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I know we have to have people

247
0:11:38.708,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who understand that social justice belongs to us all.

248
0:11:42.423,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And that wakes me up every morning,

249
0:11:44.424,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and that makes me fight even harder.

250
0:11:46.931,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Because I am moving forward, knowing what is in my past.

251
0:11:51.224,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I know the obstacles they have for me.

252
0:11:53.419,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I know what they're going to do,

253
0:11:55.053,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and I'm fairly certain they're energizing and creating new obstacles now.

254
0:11:59.046,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But they've got four years to figure it out.

255
0:12:01.506,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:02.998,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

257
0:12:08.068,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Maybe two.

258
0:12:09.568,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Cheers)

259
0:12:12.059,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

260
0:12:15.109,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But here's my point:

261
0:12:16.887,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I know what I want, and that is justice.

262
0:12:19.823,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I know why I want it,

263
0:12:21.323,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because poverty is immoral, and it is a stain on our nation.

264
0:12:25.005,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I know how I'm going to get it:

265
0:12:26.76,000 --> 0:12:28,000
by moving forward every single day.

266
0:12:28.998,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Thank you so much.

267
0:12:30.244,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Cheers)

268
0:12:32.728,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My mission in life since I was a kid was,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and is, to take the rest of you into space.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In fact, I think it is a moral imperative

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that we open the space frontier.

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to have planetary redundancy,

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And if you think about space,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
everything we hold of value on this planet --

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.

14
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.

16
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.

17
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --

18
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,

19
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.

20
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We are on the verge of the greatest exploration

21
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that the human race has ever known.

22
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We explore for three reasons,

23
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the weakest of which is curiosity.

24
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.

25
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Some images from Mars, 1997.

26
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,

27
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous

28
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
under the soils and different parts of that planet.

29
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.

30
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union

31
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,

32
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,

33
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and while the probability is very small,

34
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the impact, figured in literally,

35
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge

36
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that to spend a small fraction looking, searching,

37
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.

38
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And of course, the third motivator,

39
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.

40
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,

41
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
there's a class of the nickel iron,

42
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which in platinum-group metal markets alone

43
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are worth something like 20 trillion dollars,

44
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.

45
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,

46
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.

47
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.

48
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.

49
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.

50
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.

51
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.

52
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,

53
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."

54
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations

55
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to go and be part of this amazing mission.

56
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And we knew nothing about going to space.

57
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight

58
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to going to the moon in eight years,

59
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.

60
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They didn't know what couldn't be done.

61
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They had to make up everything.

62
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.

63
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,

64
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --

65
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,

66
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.

67
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.

68
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.

69
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.

70
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.

71
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.

72
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE

73
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.

74
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,

75
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we should be allowed to risk.

76
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,

77
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,

78
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.

79
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,

80
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and clearly the industrial-military complex --

81
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.

82
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The ability for us to access these resources

83
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to gain planetary redundancy --

84
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,

85
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you know, everything stored on our databases,

86
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and back them up off the planet,

87
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.

88
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.

89
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --

90
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the moon, to Mars. And today,

91
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz

92
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.

93
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.

94
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.

95
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz

96
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.

97
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --

98
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter) --

99
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!

100
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.

101
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth

102
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
concentrated in the hands of few individuals

103
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the technology accessible

104
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that will allow us to really drive space exploration.

105
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.

106
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,

107
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but how cheap could it get?

108
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Let's go back to high school physics here.

109
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,

110
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,

111
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --

112
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.

113
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.

114
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.

115
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,

116
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --

117
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
anybody here fast in math?

118
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?

119
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --

120
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,

121
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'll grant you that.

122
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But guys, if history has taught us anything,

124
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.

125
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I have no question that the physics,

126
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the engineering to get us down to the point

127
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.

128
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.

129
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar

130
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of their own money in R&D.

131
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's all government research dollars, and very few of those.

132
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And in fact, the large corporations,

133
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the governments, can't take the risk.

134
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.

135
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?

136
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
12 to 15 launches per year.

137
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.

138
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,

139
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I call them self-loading carbon payloads.

140
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They come with their own money. They're easy to make.

141
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,

142
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.

143
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,

144
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
carry three people up to 100 kilometers,

145
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.

146
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,

147
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
spending between one to 25 million dollars each.

148
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,

149
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
which made those two flights and won the competition.

150
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning,

151
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
for just a quick video.

152
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.

153
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Richard Searfoss: Good luck.

154
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.

156
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Applause)

157
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge

158
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of the Ansari X PRIZE competition,

159
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures

160
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.

161
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

162
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do

163
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.

164
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.

165
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?

166
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Well, people are going to die,

167
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
how can you possibly going to put this forward?"

168
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,

169
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.

170
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry

171
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.

172
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,

173
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and said, "Are you going to compete?" No.

174
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."

175
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,

176
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and I took a bet that someone would win.

177
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.

179
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We've had a lot of accomplishments

181
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's been a tremendous success.

182
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne

183
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is going to hang in Air and Space Museum,

184
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.

185
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Isn't that great? (Applause)

186
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.

187
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.

188
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,

189
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is going to be about 200,000.

190
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,

191
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.

192
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.

193
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --

194
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I know if they don't do it, I am --

195
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we're going to stockpile some fuel,

196
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.

197
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Quick moment for the designers in the audience.

199
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.

200
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan

201
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --

202
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
people think a zero gravity room,

203
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
there's a switch on there that turns it off --

204
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.

205
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.

206
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If we can get the audio up?

207
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,

208
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.

209
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
When you want the taste that won't weigh you down,

210
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the only way to go is up.

211
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.

212
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We're based down in Florida.

213
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.

214
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.

215
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize

216
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.

217
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation

218
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,

219
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we just took on a new mission statement:

220
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space

221
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and other technologies for the benefit of humanity."

222
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And this is something that we're very excited about.

223
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.

224
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And you know, when you give to a nonprofit,

225
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you might have 50 cents on the dollar.

226
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.

227
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.

228
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And that's huge. And then he turned around and said,

229
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."

230
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I said, "Well, that's great."

231
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE

232
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
into a world-class prize institute.

233
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is what happens when you put up a prize,

234
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.

235
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You get publicity increase, and when it's won,

236
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --

237
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.

238
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,

239
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.

240
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And the benefit to the sponsors

241
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.

242
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
That's our value proposition in a prize.

243
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,

244
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or any kind of a new technology,

245
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
you have to fund that from the beginning

246
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.

247
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,

248
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,

249
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and you pay on success.

250
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --

251
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
tried to go across the Atlantic,

252
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.

253
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So, prizes work great.

254
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,

255
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
you know that when you're going for a goal,

256
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the first thing you have to do is believe

257
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that you can do it yourself.

258
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule

259
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
of -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.

260
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And then you have to convince others,

261
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,

262
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies

263
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,

264
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,

265
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
what we've experienced a prize doing,

266
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,

267
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.

268
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Well, it must be a good idea.

269
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.

270
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And each of these areas was something that we found

271
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.

272
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process

273
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of how to come up with prizes and write the rules,

274
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and we're actually looking at creating prizes

275
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
in a number of different categories.

276
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --

277
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and I'll talk about those more in a moment.

278
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams

279
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.

280
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We're going after an orbital prize.

281
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We are looking at a number of energy prizes.

282
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Craig Venter has just joined our board

283
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,

284
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
we'll be announcing later this fall,

285
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA

286
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.

287
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.

288
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool

289
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,

290
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
it isn't money, it's only one thing --

291
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it's the committed, passionate human mind.

292
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

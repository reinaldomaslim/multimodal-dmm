3
0:00:16.098,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.

4
0:00:20.892,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This person had three different profiles

5
0:00:23.106,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and 890 kids between 8 and 13 years old among her friends list.

6
0:00:30.647,000 --> 0:00:33,000
These are excerpts of a chat with one of those kids.

7
0:00:37.205,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is an exact copy of the chat.

8
0:00:40.47,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's part of the case file.

9
0:00:44.706,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This kid started sending private photos

10
0:00:48.186,000 --> 0:00:5,000
until his family realized what was going on.

11
0:00:51.691,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The police report and subsequent investigation lead them to a house.

12
0:00:57.229,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This was the girl's bedroom.

13
0:01:02.271,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Nina Rodríguez was actually a 24-year-old man

14
0:01:07.302,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that used to do this with lots of kids.

15
0:01:13.291,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Micaela Ortega was 12 years old

16
0:01:16.517,000 --> 0:01:18,000
when she went to meet her new Facebook friend,

17
0:01:19.316,000 --> 0:01:2,000
also 12.

18
0:01:21.487,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Rochi de River," was her name.

19
0:01:25.962,000 --> 0:01:28,000
She actually met Jonathan Luna, who was 26 years old.

20
0:01:30.431,000 --> 0:01:31,000
When they finally caught him,

21
0:01:32.105,000 --> 0:01:36,000
he confessed that he killed the girl because she refused to have sex with him.

22
0:01:38.516,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He had four Facebook profiles

23
0:01:41.526,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and 1,700 women on his contact list;

24
0:01:46.823,000 --> 0:01:48,000
90 percent of them were under 13 years old.

25
0:01:52.349,000 --> 0:01:54,000
These are two different cases of "grooming":

26
0:01:56.015,000 --> 0:01:59,000
an adult contacts a kid through the internet,

27
0:02:00.083,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and through manipulation or lying, leads that kid into sexual territory --

28
0:02:04.451,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from talking about sex

29
0:02:06.346,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to sharing private photos,

30
0:02:08.554,000 --> 0:02:1,000
recording the kid using a webcam

31
0:02:10.795,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or arranging an in-person meeting.

32
0:02:14.347,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is grooming.

33
0:02:16.409,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This is happening, and it's on the rise.

34
0:02:21.547,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The question is: What are we going to do?

35
0:02:24.027,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Because, in the meantime, kids are alone.

36
0:02:28.544,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They finish dinner, go to their rooms,

37
0:02:30.584,000 --> 0:02:31,000
close the door,

38
0:02:32.784,000 --> 0:02:34,000
get on their computer, their cell phones,

39
0:02:35.231,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and get into a bar,

40
0:02:38.524,000 --> 0:02:39,000
into a club.

41
0:02:42.104,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Think for one second about what I've just said:

42
0:02:46.572,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they're in a place full of strangers

43
0:02:49.444,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in an uninhibited environment.

44
0:02:53.673,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The internet broke physical boundaries.

45
0:02:56.564,000 --> 0:03:,000
When we're alone in our bedroom and we go online,

46
0:03:00.619,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we're not really alone.

47
0:03:05.28,000 --> 0:03:09,000
There are at least two reasons why we're not taking care of this,

48
0:03:09.984,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or at least not in the right way.

49
0:03:13.599,000 --> 0:03:17,000
First, we're sure that everything that happens online is "virtual."

50
0:03:18.03,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In fact, we call it "the virtual world."

51
0:03:22.839,000 --> 0:03:23,000
If you look it up in the dictionary,

52
0:03:25.636,000 --> 0:03:27,000
something virtual is something that seems to exist

53
0:03:28.135,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but is not real.

54
0:03:30.848,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we use that word to talk about the internet:

55
0:03:35.044,000 --> 0:03:36,000
something not real.

56
0:03:38.687,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And that's the problem with grooming.

57
0:03:41.094,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It is real.

58
0:03:43.534,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Degenerate, perverted adults use the internet to abuse boys and girls

59
0:03:49.372,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and take advantage of, among other things,

60
0:03:51.481,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the fact that the kids and their parents think that what happens online

61
0:03:54.915,000 --> 0:03:55,000
doesn't actually happen.

62
0:03:59.451,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Several years ago, some colleagues and I founded an NGO

63
0:04:03.184,000 --> 0:04:04,000
called "Argentina Cibersegura,"

64
0:04:05.152,000 --> 0:04:08,000
dedicated to raising awareness about online safety.

65
0:04:10.498,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In 2013, we attended meetings at the House of Legislature

66
0:04:14.723,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to discuss a law about grooming.

67
0:04:19.508,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I remember that a lot of people thought

68
0:04:21.807,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that grooming was strictly a precursor

69
0:04:24.003,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to arranging an in-person meeting with a kid to have sex with them.

70
0:04:30.067,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But they didn't think about what happened to the kids who were exposed

71
0:04:33.695,000 --> 0:04:36,000
by talking about sex with an adult without knowing it,

72
0:04:37.724,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or who shared intimate photos thinking only another kid would see them,

73
0:04:41.494,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or even worse,

74
0:04:43.707,000 --> 0:04:45,000
who had exposed themselves using their web cam.

75
0:04:46.695,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Nobody considered that rape.

76
0:04:51.047,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'm sure lots of you find it odd to think one person can abuse another

77
0:04:55.388,000 --> 0:04:56,000
without physical contact.

78
0:04:57.562,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We're programmed to think that way.

79
0:05:01.003,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I know, because I used to think that way.

80
0:05:03.094,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I was just an IT security guy

81
0:05:07.168,000 --> 0:05:08,000
until this happened to me.

82
0:05:11.243,000 --> 0:05:12,000
At the end of 2011,

83
0:05:13.999,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in a little town in Buenos Aires Province,

84
0:05:16.562,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I heard about a case for the first time.

85
0:05:20.6,000 --> 0:05:21,000
After giving a talk,

86
0:05:23.108,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I met the parents of an 11-year-old girl who had been a victim of grooming.

87
0:05:29.934,000 --> 0:05:33,000
A man had manipulated her into masturbating in front of her web cam,

88
0:05:33.981,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and recorded it.

89
0:05:36.027,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And the video was on several websites.

90
0:05:40.801,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That day, her parents asked us, in tears,

91
0:05:43.506,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to tell them the magic formula

92
0:05:45.072,000 --> 0:05:47,000
for how to delete those videos from the internet.

93
0:05:49.856,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It broke my heart and changed me forever

94
0:05:53.537,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to be their last disappointment, telling them it was too late:

95
0:05:57.491,000 --> 0:05:59,000
once content is online,

96
0:06:00.061,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we've already lost control.

97
0:06:04.534,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Since that day, I think about that girl

98
0:06:08.93,000 --> 0:06:11,000
waking up in the morning, having breakfast with her family,

99
0:06:12.496,000 --> 0:06:13,000
who had seen the video,

100
0:06:15.031,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and then walking to school, meeting people that had seen her naked,

101
0:06:20.484,000 --> 0:06:24,000
arriving to school, playing with her friends, who had also seen her.

102
0:06:26.65,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That was her life.

103
0:06:29.322,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Exposed.

104
0:06:33.581,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Of course, nobody raped her body.

105
0:06:37.175,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But hadn't her sexuality been abused?

106
0:06:42.543,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We clearly use different standards to measure physical and digital things.

107
0:06:49.183,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And we get angry at social networks

108
0:06:51.143,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because being angry with ourselves is more painful and more true.

109
0:06:56.595,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And this brings us to the second reason why

110
0:06:58.657,000 --> 0:07:,000
we aren't paying proper attention to this issue.

111
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We're convinced that kids don't need our help,

112
0:07:06.513,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that they "know everything" about technology.

113
0:07:11.912,000 --> 0:07:12,000
When I was a kid,

114
0:07:14.41,000 --> 0:07:17,000
at one point, my parents started letting me walk to school alone.

115
0:07:19.149,000 --> 0:07:22,000
After years of taking me by the hand and walking me to school,

116
0:07:24.296,000 --> 0:07:25,000
one day they sat me down,

117
0:07:25.906,000 --> 0:07:26,000
gave me the house keys

118
0:07:27.773,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and said, "Be very careful with these; don't give them to anyone,

119
0:07:31.784,000 --> 0:07:35,000
take the route we showed you, be at home at the time we said,

120
0:07:35.963,000 --> 0:07:37,000
cross at the corner, and look both ways before you cross,

121
0:07:38.726,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and no matter what, don't talk to strangers."

122
0:07:44.787,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I knew everything about walking,

123
0:07:47.708,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and yet, there was a responsible adult there taking care of me.

124
0:07:52.706,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

125
0:07:54.706,000 --> 0:07:56,000
knowing how to take care of yourself is another.

126
0:07:58.469,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Imagine this situation:

127
0:08:00.381,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I'm 10 or 11 years old, I wake up in the morning,

128
0:08:02.969,000 --> 0:08:04,000
my parents toss me the keys and say,

129
0:08:05.109,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Seba, now you can walk to school alone."

130
0:08:08.307,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And when I come back late,

131
0:08:11.355,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they say, "No, you need to be home at the time we said."

132
0:08:16.646,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And two weeks later,

133
0:08:18.534,000 --> 0:08:21,000
when it comes up, they say, "You know what?

134
0:08:21.667,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You have to cross at the corner, and look both ways before crossing."

135
0:08:26.635,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And two years later, they say,

136
0:08:29.301,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"And also, don't talk to strangers."

137
0:08:34.686,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It sounds absurd, right?

138
0:08:38.132,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We have the same absurd behavior in relation to technology.

139
0:08:41.949,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We give kids total access

140
0:08:44.116,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and we see if one day, sooner or later,

141
0:08:46.98,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they learn how to take care of themselves.

142
0:08:50.762,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

143
0:08:52.79,000 --> 0:08:54,000
knowing how to take care of yourself is another.

144
0:08:56.523,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Along those same lines, when we talk to parents,

145
0:08:59.124,000 --> 0:09:04,000
they often say they don't care about technology and social networks.

146
0:09:06.022,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I always rejoin that by asking if they care about their kids.

147
0:09:09.796,000 --> 0:09:11,000
As adults, being interested or not in technology

148
0:09:12.284,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is the same as being interested or not in our kids.

149
0:09:15.13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The internet is part of their lives.

150
0:09:18.52,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Technology forces us to rethink the relationship between adults and kids.

151
0:09:24.804,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Education was always based on two main concepts:

152
0:09:28.028,000 --> 0:09:3,000
experience and knowledge.

153
0:09:32.507,000 --> 0:09:37,000
How do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don't have either?

154
0:09:39.875,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Nowadays, we adults have to guide our children

155
0:09:42.638,000 --> 0:09:44,000
through what is often for us unfamiliar territory --

156
0:09:45.12,000 --> 0:09:47,000
territory much more inviting for them.

157
0:09:49.321,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's impossible to find an answer

158
0:09:52.413,000 --> 0:09:55,000
without doing new things -- things that make us uncomfortable,

159
0:09:55.485,000 --> 0:09:56,000
things we're not used to.

160
0:09:59.401,000 --> 0:10:01,000
A lot of you may think it's easy for me,

161
0:10:02.116,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because I'm relatively young.

162
0:10:04.501,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it used to be that way.

163
0:10:07.162,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Used to.

164
0:10:10.069,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Until last year,

165
0:10:11.959,000 --> 0:10:15,000
when I felt the weight of my age on my shoulders

166
0:10:17.242,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the first time I opened Snapchat.

167
0:10:22.21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Laughter)

168
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause)

169
0:10:31.405,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I didn't understand a thing!

170
0:10:35.141,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I found it unnecessary,

171
0:10:37.493,000 --> 0:10:4,000
useless, hard to understand;

172
0:10:40.659,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it looked like a camera!

173
0:10:42.571,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It didn't have menu options!

174
0:10:46.58,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It was the first time I felt the gap

175
0:10:49.292,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that sometimes exists between kids and adults.

176
0:10:53.562,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But it was also an opportunity to do the right thing,

177
0:10:56.846,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to leave my comfort zone, to force myself.

178
0:11:00.768,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,

179
0:11:04.103,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but then I asked my teenage cousin to show me how to use it.

180
0:11:10.169,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I also asked why she used it.

181
0:11:12.608,000 --> 0:11:13,000
What was fun about it?

182
0:11:15.558,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We had a really nice talk.

183
0:11:17.749,000 --> 0:11:19,000
She showed me her Snapchat, she told me things,

184
0:11:20.226,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we got closer, we laughed.

185
0:11:24.769,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Today, I use it.

186
0:11:26.495,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

187
0:11:28.608,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I don't know if I do it right,

188
0:11:30.257,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but the most important thing is that I know it and I understand it.

189
0:11:36.226,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The key was to overcome the initial shock

190
0:11:40.387,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and do something new.

191
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Something new.

192
0:11:45.264,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Today, we have the chance to create new conversations.

193
0:11:49.132,000 --> 0:11:51,000
What's the last app you downloaded?

194
0:11:51.472,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Which social network do you use to contact your friends?

195
0:11:54.894,000 --> 0:11:56,000
What kind of information do you share?

196
0:11:58.379,000 --> 0:12:,000
Have you ever been approached by strangers?

197
0:12:02.682,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Could we have these conversations between kids and adults?

198
0:12:07.356,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We have to force ourselves to do it. All of us.

199
0:12:10.063,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Today, lots of kids are listening to us.

200
0:12:16.527,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Sometimes when we go to schools to give our talks,

201
0:12:19.284,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or through social networks,

202
0:12:20.958,000 --> 0:12:22,000
kids ask or tell us things

203
0:12:23.312,000 --> 0:12:27,000
they haven't told their parents or their teachers.

204
0:12:27.633,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They tell us -- they don't even know us.

205
0:12:32.786,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Those kids need to know

206
0:12:35.955,000 --> 0:12:37,000
what the risks of being online are,

207
0:12:39.994,000 --> 0:12:4,000
how to take care of themselves,

208
0:12:41.524,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but also that, fundamentally, as with almost everything else,

209
0:12:45.115,000 --> 0:12:48,000
kids can learn this from any adult.

210
0:12:51.378,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Online safety needs to be a conversation topic

211
0:12:55.288,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in every house and every classroom in the country.

212
0:12:59.683,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We did a survey this year that showed that 15 percent of schools said

213
0:13:03.972,000 --> 0:13:05,000
they knew of cases of grooming in their school.

214
0:13:07.206,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And this number is growing.

215
0:13:11.65,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Technology changed every aspect of our life,

216
0:13:15.135,000 --> 0:13:17,000
including the risks we face

217
0:13:17.9,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and how we take care of ourselves.

218
0:13:20.326,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Grooming shows us this in the most painful way:

219
0:13:24.908,000 --> 0:13:25,000
by involving our kids.

220
0:13:28.607,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Are we going to do something to avoid this?

221
0:13:32.022,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The solution starts with something as easy as:

222
0:13:36.239,000 --> 0:13:37,000
talking about it.

223
0:13:37.528,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you.

224
0:13:38.71,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

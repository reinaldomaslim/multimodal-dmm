1
0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Ever since I was a young girl, I was always fascinated --

2
0:00:16.333,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:17.514,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Oh!

4
0:00:18.689,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.149,000 --> 0:00:23,000
OK, I meant younger and more short.

6
0:00:23.507,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:24.704,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If that's possible to imagine.

8
0:00:27.101,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But ever since I was a young girl,

9
0:00:29.196,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was always fascinated with how the world worked exactly how it did.

10
0:00:34.403,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So this, very early on,

11
0:00:36.895,000 --> 0:00:39,000
led me to the fields of mathematics and chemistry.

12
0:00:41.481,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I would keep going further and further, and as I kept going,

13
0:00:45.252,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I realized that all the fields of science are interconnected.

14
0:00:48.95,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And without one, the others have little or no value.

15
0:00:54.188,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, inspired by Marie Curie and my local science museum,

16
0:00:58.354,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I decided to start asking these questions myself

17
0:01:01.673,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and engage in my own independent research,

18
0:01:04.522,000 --> 0:01:06,000
whether it be out of my garage or my bedroom.

19
0:01:08.367,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I started reading journal papers,

20
0:01:10.431,000 --> 0:01:12,000
started doing science competitions,

21
0:01:12.732,000 --> 0:01:14,000
started participating in science fairs,

22
0:01:15.613,000 --> 0:01:16,000
doing anything I could

23
0:01:17.513,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to get the knowledge that I so desperately wanted.

24
0:01:21.712,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So while I was studying anatomy for a competition,

25
0:01:25.895,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I came across the topic of something called chronic wounds.

26
0:01:30.371,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And one thing that stood out to me was a statistic

27
0:01:34.693,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that said that the number of people in the United States with chronic wounds

28
0:01:39.807,000 --> 0:01:42,000
exceeds the number of people with breast cancer,

29
0:01:43.411,000 --> 0:01:48,000
colon cancer, lung cancer and leukemia, combined.

30
0:01:49.966,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Hold up.

31
0:01:51.141,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So what is a chronic wound?

32
0:01:52.696,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:53.871,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And why haven't I heard about a 5K walk for chronic wounds,

34
0:01:57.3,000 --> 0:01:59,000
why haven't I even heard about a chronic wound in general?

35
0:02:00.275,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:04.387,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So after I got past those preliminary questions,

37
0:02:07.379,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and one that I will clarify for you,

38
0:02:09.696,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a chronic wound is essentially when someone gets a normal wound,

39
0:02:13.53,000 --> 0:02:15,000
except it fails to heal normally

40
0:02:16.212,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because the patient has some kind of preexisting condition,

41
0:02:19.974,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which in most cases is diabetes.

42
0:02:25.613,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So more staggering statistics were to be found

43
0:02:28.661,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as I kept going on in this research.

44
0:02:31.109,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In the year 2010 alone,

45
0:02:32.937,000 --> 0:02:38,000
50 billion dollars were spent worldwide to treat chronic wounds.

46
0:02:39.95,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In addition, it's estimated that about two percent of the population

47
0:02:43.442,000 --> 0:02:45,000
will get a chronic wound at some point in their lifetime.

48
0:02:46.8,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This was absurd.

49
0:02:49.244,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So as I started doing more research,

50
0:02:51.015,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I found that there was a correlation

51
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:54,000
between the moisture level inside a wound dressing

52
0:02:55.403,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the stage of healing that the chronic wound would be at.

53
0:03:00.069,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I decided, why don't I design something

54
0:03:02.681,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to measure the moisture level within the wound

55
0:03:04.934,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so this can help doctors and patients treat their wounds better.

56
0:03:09.696,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And essentially, expedite the healing process.

57
0:03:13.085,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So that's exactly what I set out to do.

58
0:03:16.157,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Being a 14-year-old working out of her garage-turned-lab,

59
0:03:20.355,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I had a lot of constraints.

60
0:03:22.419,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Most being that I wasn't given a grant, I wasn't given a lot of money,

61
0:03:26.228,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I wasn't given a lot of resources.

62
0:03:28.79,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In addition, I had a lot of criteria, as well.

63
0:03:32.329,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Since this product would be readily interacting with the body,

64
0:03:36.044,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it had to be biocompatible,

65
0:03:38.244,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it also had to be low-cost,

66
0:03:40.205,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as I was designing it and paying for it myself.

67
0:03:44.157,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It also had to be mass-manufacturable,

68
0:03:46.403,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because I wanted it to be made anywhere, for anyone.

69
0:03:51.442,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Thus, I drafted up a schematic.

70
0:03:53.482,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What you see on the left hand-side is the early schematics in my design,

71
0:03:57.998,000 --> 0:04:02,000
showing both a bird's-eye view and also one stacking variant.

72
0:04:03.366,000 --> 0:04:04,000
A stacking variant means

73
0:04:04.565,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that the entire product is consisted of different individual parts

74
0:04:09.779,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that have to work in unison.

75
0:04:11.593,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And what's shown there is one possible arrangement.

76
0:04:18.479,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So what exactly is this?

77
0:04:20.665,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I had gone on to testing my sensors

78
0:04:22.688,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and as all scientists have stumbles along their work,

79
0:04:26.228,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I also had a couple of problems in my first generation of sensors.

80
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:3,000
First of all, I couldn't figure out

81
0:04:31.529,000 --> 0:04:33,000
how to get a nanoparticle ink into a printcheck cartridge

82
0:04:34.522,000 --> 0:04:35,000
without spilling it all over my carpet.

83
0:04:36.799,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That was problem number one.

84
0:04:38.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Problem number two was,

85
0:04:40.078,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I couldn't exactly control the sensitivity of my sensors.

86
0:04:43.546,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I couldn't scale them up or down,

87
0:04:46.077,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I couldn't really do anything of that sort.

88
0:04:48.181,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I wanted something to solve it.

89
0:04:49.843,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Problem one was easily solved by some scouting on eBay and Amazon

90
0:04:52.958,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for syringes that I could use.

91
0:04:54.727,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Problem two, however, required a lot more thought.

92
0:04:57.863,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So this is where this factors in.

93
0:05:00.077,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So what a space-filling curve does

94
0:05:01.741,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is it aims to take up all the area it can within one unit square.

95
0:05:06.641,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And by writing a computer program, you can have different iterations

96
0:05:10.938,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of the different curve,

97
0:05:12.482,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which increasingly get close to one unit square,

98
0:05:14.768,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but never quite reaches there.

99
0:05:18.212,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So now I could control the thickness, the size,

100
0:05:20.677,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I could do whatever I want with it, and I could predict my results.

101
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So I started constructing my sensors

102
0:05:27.967,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and testing them more rigorously,

103
0:05:30.118,000 --> 0:05:33,000
using money that I had gotten from previous science fair awards.

104
0:05:34.177,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Lastly, I had to connect this data in order to be read.

105
0:05:38.089,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip,

106
0:05:40.582,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which you can see here by the app screenshots on the right.

107
0:05:44.346,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And what this does is that anyone can monitor the progress of their wound,

108
0:05:48.165,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it can be transmitted over a wireless connection

109
0:05:52.603,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to the doctor, the patient or whoever needs it.

110
0:05:57.079,000 --> 0:05:59,000
[Continued Testing and Refinement]

111
0:05:59.105,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So in conclusion, my design was successful --

112
0:06:02.883,000 --> 0:06:04,000
however, science never ends.

113
0:06:06.097,000 --> 0:06:09,000
There's always something to be done, something to be refined.

114
0:06:09.18,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So that's what I'm currently in the process of doing.

115
0:06:12.776,000 --> 0:06:14,000
However, what I learned was

116
0:06:14.853,000 --> 0:06:17,000
what's more important than the actual thing I designed

117
0:06:18.173,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is an attitude that I had taken on while doing this.

118
0:06:22.18,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And that attitude was,

119
0:06:24.339,000 --> 0:06:27,000
even though I'm a 14-year-old working in her garage

120
0:06:27.697,000 --> 0:06:3,000
on something that she doesn't completely understand,

121
0:06:31.418,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I could still make a difference and contribute to the field.

122
0:06:35.792,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And that's what inspired me to keep going,

123
0:06:38.236,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and I hope it inspires many others to also do work like this

124
0:06:42.117,000 --> 0:06:44,000
even though they're not very sure about it.

125
0:06:45.768,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I hope that's a message that you all take on today.

126
0:06:48.356,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Thank you.

127
0:06:49.563,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

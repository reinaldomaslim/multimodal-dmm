1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.

2
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Before I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:

3
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Why does poverty exist?

4
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.

5
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We all live in the same planet,

6
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.

7
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,

8
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,

9
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to see whether it's contributing or --

10
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.

11
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.

12
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And by and large, this has failed.

13
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And you can see this book,

14
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,

15
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.

16
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
By and large, it did not work.

17
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So the question is, why is that?

18
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.

19
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,

20
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,

21
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
right across the street from here.

22
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,

23
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where citizens were empowered by technologies.

24
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And they demanded authorities from --

25
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to come down from their high horses.

26
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And in the end, there's better bargaining

27
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
between the authorities and citizens,

28
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.

29
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so you can see, the real process of --

30
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and this is backed up by this 500-page book --

31
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that the authorities came down and citizens got up.

32
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But if you look, if you have that perspective,

33
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.

34
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Aid actually did the opposite.

35
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It empowered authorities,

36
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and, as a result, marginalized citizens.

37
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen

38
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
so that they could tax people

39
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and make more money for to run their business.

40
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Because they were getting it from abroad.

41
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,

42
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --

43
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.

44
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.

45
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --

46
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
their hands, legs, brains, what have you.

47
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries

48
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is to recognize that economic development is of the people,

49
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
by the people, for the people.

50
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And that is the real network effect.

51
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,

52
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so that their voices are heard,

53
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
so then things would improve.

54
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,

55
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the World Bank, is an organization of the government,

56
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
by the government, for the governments.

57
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Just see the contrast.

58
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.

59
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Of course, how would you empower citizens?

60
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.

61
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Recently "The Economist" recognized this,

62
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,

63
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and that's what I've been working on.

64
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.

65
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.

66
0:04:53,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;

67
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we could update each other more often.

68
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But one time it broke down.

69
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And it reminded me of a day in 1971.

70
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There was a war going on in my country.

71
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,

72
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to a remote rural area where it was safer.

73
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.

74
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.

75
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.

76
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So I had another unproductive day.

77
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,

78
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I put those two experiences together side by side,

79
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --

80
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:5,000
whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.

81
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So naturally, I -- the implication of that is

82
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.

83
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
And if that's the case, then the question is

84
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
how many telephones did we have at that time?

85
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh

86
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for every 500 people.

87
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And all those phones were in the few urban places.

88
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,

89
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
there were no telephones.

90
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,

91
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
just like I wasted a day.

92
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,

93
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.

94
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,

95
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is their days are the same length: 24 hours.

96
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So if you lose that precious resource,

97
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,

98
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that's a huge waste.

99
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So I started looking for any evidence that --

100
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
does connectivity really increase productivity?

101
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,

102
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.

103
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They show an interesting thing.

104
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.

105
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.

106
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And so the impact of one new telephone,

107
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is on the vertical axis, is very little.

108
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,

109
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,

110
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.

111
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The question was,

112
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?

113
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It turns out: 2,000 dollars.

114
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,

115
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.

116
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So obviously this was a gadget to have.

117
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,

118
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because there's a digital revolution going on,

119
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
then it would be even more dramatic.

120
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I knew a little economics by then --

121
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.

122
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But how would you specialize?

123
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.

124
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.

125
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,

126
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is if we can connect with each other.

127
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.

128
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.

129
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But in order to expand that, you need a river,

130
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.

131
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.

132
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And that leads to specialization.

133
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That leads to productivity.

134
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So the question was, I started looking at this issue,

135
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.

136
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There were a lot of reasons people told me

137
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
why we don't have enough telephones.

138
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And one of them is the lacking buying power.

139
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.

140
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?

141
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I mean, in America, people buy cars,

142
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and they put very little money down.

143
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They get a car, and they go to work.

144
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The work pays them a salary;

145
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the salary allows them to pay for the car over time.

146
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The car pays for itself.

147
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So if the telephone is a production tool,

148
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.

149
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?

150
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?

151
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,

152
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.

153
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.

154
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So we could do that for telephones.

155
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:

156
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
food, clothing, shelter, whatever.

157
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But again, it's very paternalistic.

158
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You should be raising income

159
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and let people decide what they want to do with their money.

160
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.

161
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.

162
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.

163
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because there were -- there were people who had computers.

164
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They had modems.

165
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.

166
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But that's what's lacking in a poor country.

167
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,

168
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
few banks to collect bills, etc.

169
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,

170
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.

171
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And they had these branches.

172
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.

173
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started --

174
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I first went to them and said,

175
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."

176
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,

177
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:3,000
so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,

178
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.

179
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,

180
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and then to be -- and rock the boat.

181
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I started focusing. What is it that they really do?

182
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.

183
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.

184
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.

185
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.

186
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.

187
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,

188
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
get a phone and have the phone for everybody.

189
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And it's a business for her.

190
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,

191
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"It's a little crazy, but logical.

192
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."

193
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.

194
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I created a company in America called Gonofone,

195
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
which in Bengali means "people's phone."

196
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And angel investors in America put in money into that.

197
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I flew around the world.

198
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,

199
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,

200
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.

201
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
After about a million miles, and a meaningful --

202
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --

203
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
which involved the Norwegian telephone company,

204
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which provided the know-how,

205
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.

206
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.

207
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can see it's pretty much covered.

208
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.

209
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year

210
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to extend that coverage.

211
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now, about that cow model I talked about.

212
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:29,000
There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services

213
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in their neighborhoods.

214
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.

215
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And these phones are generating

216
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
about 100 million dollars for the company.

217
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.

218
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.

219
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It increases income, improves welfare, etc.

220
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,

221
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:05,000
with 3.5 million subscribers,

222
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
115,000 of these phones I talked about --

223
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.

224
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --

225
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.

226
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.

227
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And again, here are some of the lessons.

228
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
"The government needs to provide economically viable services."

229
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.

230
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
"Governments need to subsidize private companies."

231
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is what some people think.

232
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And actually, private companies help governments with taxes.

233
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"Poor people are recipients."

234
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Poor people are a resource.

235
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
"Services cost too much for the poor."

236
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Their involvement reduces the cost.

237
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."

238
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.

239
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
I've been very surprised.

240
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.

241
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
"Poor countries need aid."

242
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Businesses -- this one company has raised the --

243
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:14,000
if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company

244
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.

245
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,

246
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:27,000
aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.

247
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.

248
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
He has produced some power generators,

249
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,

250
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,

251
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:45,000
which is running these generators.

252
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.

253
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It's just an experiment.

254
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We don't know how far it will go,

255
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but it's going on.

256
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you.

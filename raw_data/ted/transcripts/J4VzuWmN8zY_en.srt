1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
How about this word?

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here, I'll show it to you.

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."

7
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's little discrete --

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And those bits are words.

12
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --

13
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,

14
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like lexicographical.

15
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Lexicographical has this great pattern:

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,

17
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."

19
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Right? It's a fun word to say,

20
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I get to say it a lot.

21
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer

22
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.

24
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.

25
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.

26
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But people think that my job is to let the good words

27
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,

28
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and keep the bad words out.

29
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.

31
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:,000
And for another, deciding what words are good

32
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and what words are bad is actually not very easy.

33
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.

35
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation

36
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:2,000
as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.

37
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English

38
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.

39
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?

40
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, I blame the Queen.

41
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Why do I blame the Queen?

42
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.

43
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But secondly, I blame the Queen because

44
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
dictionaries have really not changed.

45
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.

46
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries

47
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in American dictionaries since 1965.

49
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.

50
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.

51
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.

52
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So he's really responsible for a lot of

53
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what we consider modern in dictionaries today.

54
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,

55
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is the face of modernity, you have a problem.

56
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.

57
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There'd be virtually no learning curve.

58
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!

59
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Computers! What about computers?

60
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The thing about computers is, I love computers.

61
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.

62
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.

63
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But computers don't do much else other than

64
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.

65
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They don't change the end result.

66
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Because what a dictionary is,

67
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.

68
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.

69
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!

70
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The design has not changed.

71
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?

72
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Online dictionaries must be different.

73
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.

74
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is my favorite word, by the way.

75
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.

76
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Very useful word. So, look at that.

77
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.

78
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!

79
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Right? Those little buttons,

80
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I had them all expanded except for the date chart.

81
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So there's not very much going on here.

82
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There's not a lot of clickiness.

83
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate

84
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.

85
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And when you improve searchability,

86
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.

87
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,

88
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.

89
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,

90
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
what we have here is a ham butt problem.

91
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?

92
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.

93
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,

94
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,

95
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"

96
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."

97
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So she calls up mom, and she says,

98
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"

99
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"

100
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So they call grandma, and grandma says,

101
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)

102
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.

103
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We have a pan that's too small!

104
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.

105
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place

106
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and they don't find a place on the map,

107
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they think, "This map sucks!"

108
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,

109
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."

110
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,

111
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.

112
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?

113
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So, you can't get a smaller ham.

114
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The English language is as big as it is.

115
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So, if you have a ham butt problem,

116
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,

117
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:

118
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
paper is the enemy of words.

119
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.

120
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Some of my best friends are books.

121
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.

122
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.

123
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"

124
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.

125
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,

126
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.

127
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,

128
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.

129
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape

130
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be

131
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.

132
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,

133
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
artificial constraints lead to

134
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.

135
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What if biologists could only study animals

136
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that made people go, "Aww." Right?

137
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,

138
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?

139
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,

140
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and not very much about much else.

141
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I think this is a problem.

142
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I think we should study all the words,

143
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions

144
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:46,000
from very humble parts.

145
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Lexicography is really more about material science.

146
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We are studying the tolerances of the materials

147
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that you use to build the structure of your expression:

148
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:03,000
your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,

149
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:08,000
"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"

150
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools

151
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,

152
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?

153
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"

154
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They're just the right tools for the job.

155
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"

156
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You know, anybody who's read a children's book

157
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
knows that love makes things real.

158
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.

159
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.

160
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.

161
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
If you love a word, it becomes real.

162
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,

163
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:59,000
if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less

164
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
about control and more about description,

165
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
then we can think of the English language

166
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as being this beautiful mobile.

167
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,

168
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is touched, any time you touch a word,

169
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,

170
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you verb it, you make the mobile move.

171
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,

172
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and that new position can be just as beautiful.

173
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --

174
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the problem with being a traffic cop is

175
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,

176
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
or the cars get confused. Right?

177
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,

178
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.

179
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You can ask for help!

180
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.

181
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Library of Congress: 17 million books,

182
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of which half are in English.

183
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
If only one out of every 10 of those books

184
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,

185
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.

186
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And I find an un-dictionaried word --

187
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --

188
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?

189
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,

190
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:25,000
58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100

191
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,

192
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it would be an entire other OED.

193
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:36,000
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.

194
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --

195
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week

196
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
than I do Newsweek or Time.

197
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
There's a lot going on there.

198
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I'm not even talking about polysemy,

199
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
which is the greedy habit some words have of taking

200
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:55,000
more than one meaning for themselves.

201
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,

202
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,

203
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and there's one numbered definition in the OED.

204
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.

205
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.

206
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:15,000
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."

207
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Do you know what that says to me?

208
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)

209
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That's a lexicographical cop out,

210
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."

211
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!

212
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the thing is, we could ask for help --

213
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
asking for help's not that hard.

214
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.

215
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,

216
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and this is more of a visual explanation.

217
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,

218
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
these bright spots are what we know about,

219
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.

220
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:54,000
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.

221
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And we don't even know the shape of the language.

222
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --

223
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,

224
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but there's no California!

225
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We're missing California from American English.

226
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.

227
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.

228
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.

229
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But even if it were, rocket science is being done

230
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?

231
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It can't be that hard to find some words!

232
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So, enough scientists in other disciplines

233
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.

234
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers

235
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
can upload information about their bird sightings.

236
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And then, ornithologists can go

237
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and help track populations, migrations, etc.

238
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.

239
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
He's a director of an electroplating company.

240
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
He's found more than 140 comets.

241
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.

242
0:12:58,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.

243
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.

244
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.

245
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,

246
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and that's how he found them.

247
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
If we can find comets without a telescope,

248
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
shouldn't we be able to find words?

249
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.

250
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.

251
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And the Internet is great for collecting words,

252
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because the Internet's full of collectors.

253
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,

254
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.

255
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be

256
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?

257
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,

258
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.

259
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
They show the word, but they don't show any context.

260
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Where did it come from? Who said it?

261
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What newspaper was it in? What book?

262
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.

263
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,

264
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.

265
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.

266
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.

267
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It dies too fast.

268
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So, this whole time I've been saying,

269
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."

270
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,

271
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.

272
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
They use it synecdochically.

273
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"

274
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."

275
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point

276
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.

277
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --

278
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
like the dictionary is a part of the language,

279
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:44,000
or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --

280
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
then you're using it synecdochically.

281
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.

282
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.

283
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:,000
We can put in all the meanings.

284
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?

285
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --

286
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
we can make it be the whole language.

287
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,

288
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:16,000
who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember

289
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.

290
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
This is what dictionaries used to look like.

291
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.

292
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.

293
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It wasn't really what people needed.

294
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,

295
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:39,000
no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,

296
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we can really describe the language like scientists.

297
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.

298
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,

299
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.

300
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

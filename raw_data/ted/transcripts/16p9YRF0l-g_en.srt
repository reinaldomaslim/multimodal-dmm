2
0:00:16.433,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence.

3
0:00:20.703,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to start way back in the third grade

4
0:00:23.871,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.

5
0:00:27.257,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.

6
0:00:31.75,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink.

7
0:00:37.376,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And at one point, one of the girls that was sitting at his table,

8
0:00:40.959,000 --> 0:00:43,000
seeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him,

9
0:00:44.597,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."

10
0:00:49.025,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And Brian's shoulders sank.

11
0:00:50.827,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.

12
0:00:55.045,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again.

13
0:00:59.955,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I wonder how often that happens, you know?

14
0:01:03.356,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class,

15
0:01:08.286,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a lot of them want to come up after class

16
0:01:10.333,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and tell me about their similar experience,

17
0:01:12.374,000 --> 0:01:13,000
how a teacher shut them down,

18
0:01:14.008,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or how a student was particularly cruel to them.

19
0:01:16.693,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative

20
0:01:20.259,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at that point.

21
0:01:22.415,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I see that opting out that happens in childhood,

22
0:01:26.061,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even,

23
0:01:29.38,000 --> 0:01:31,000
by the time you get to adult life.

24
0:01:33.401,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So we see a lot of this.

25
0:01:37.562,000 --> 0:01:38,000
When we have a workshop

26
0:01:38.986,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or when we have clients in to work with us side by side,

27
0:01:41.756,000 --> 0:01:43,000
eventually we get to the point in the process

28
0:01:44.057,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.

29
0:01:47.003,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And eventually, these big-shot executives whip out their BlackBerrys

30
0:01:51.207,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and they say they have to make really important phone calls,

31
0:01:54.134,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and they head for the exits.

32
0:01:56.278,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And they're just so uncomfortable.

33
0:01:58.55,000 --> 0:02:,000
When we track them down and ask them what's going on,

34
0:02:01.193,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they say something like, "I'm just not the creative type."

35
0:02:04.828,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But we know that's not true.

36
0:02:06.963,000 --> 0:02:08,000
If they stick with the process, if they stick with it,

37
0:02:09.655,000 --> 0:02:11,000
they end up doing amazing things.

38
0:02:11.9,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And they surprise themselves at just how innovative

39
0:02:14.874,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they and their teams really are.

40
0:02:18.368,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have,

41
0:02:22.978,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged;

42
0:02:26.484,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged.

43
0:02:31.014,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And I had a major breakthrough,

44
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura.

45
0:02:37.191,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura, but if you go to Wikipedia,

46
0:02:40.492,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history --

47
0:02:44.658,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you know, like Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura.

48
0:02:48.391,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:49.827,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Bandura is 86 and he still works at Stanford.

50
0:02:52.835,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And he's just a lovely guy.

51
0:02:56.342,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So I went to see him,

52
0:02:57.646,000 --> 0:03:,000
because he's just worked on phobias for a long time,

53
0:03:01.172,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which I'm very interested in.

54
0:03:02.629,000 --> 0:03:06,000
He had developed this way,

55
0:03:06.891,000 --> 0:03:08,000
this, kind of, methodology,

56
0:03:09.641,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time,

57
0:03:12.616,000 --> 0:03:13,000
like, in four hours.

58
0:03:13.999,000 --> 0:03:16,000
He had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.

59
0:03:17.459,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And we talked about snakes -- I don't know why --

60
0:03:20.447,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia.

61
0:03:25.531,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And it was really enjoyable, really interesting.

62
0:03:28.511,000 --> 0:03:32,000
He told me that he'd invite the test subject in,

63
0:03:33.478,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room

64
0:03:36.389,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and we're going to go in there."

65
0:03:39.681,000 --> 0:03:41,000
To which, he reported, most of them replied,

66
0:03:41.845,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"Hell no! I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there."

67
0:03:46.649,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful.

68
0:03:50.973,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror

69
0:03:53.903,000 --> 0:03:55,000
looking into the room where the snake was.

70
0:03:56.628,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

71
0:03:58.692,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Then through a series of steps,

72
0:04:00.272,000 --> 0:04:03,000
he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open,

73
0:04:03.981,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and they'd be looking in there.

74
0:04:05.519,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

75
0:04:07.49,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And then many more steps later, baby steps,

76
0:04:10.204,000 --> 0:04:14,000
they'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on,

77
0:04:14.3,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and they'd eventually touch the snake.

78
0:04:17.835,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And when they touched the snake, everything was fine. They were cured.

79
0:04:22.463,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact, everything was better than fine.

80
0:04:24.607,000 --> 0:04:27,000
These people who had lifelong fears of snakes

81
0:04:28.479,000 --> 0:04:29,000
were saying things like,

82
0:04:30.656,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"Look how beautiful that snake is."

83
0:04:32.658,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And they were holding it in their laps.

84
0:04:36.933,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Bandura calls this process "guided mastery."

85
0:04:40.842,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I love that term: guided mastery.

86
0:04:44.341,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And something else happened.

87
0:04:46.482,000 --> 0:04:49,000
These people who went through the process and touched the snake

88
0:04:50.008,000 --> 0:04:53,000
ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives.

89
0:04:54.779,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They tried harder, they persevered longer,

90
0:04:57.375,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they were more resilient in the face of failure.

91
0:05:01.088,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They just gained a new confidence.

92
0:05:05.399,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And Bandura calls that confidence "self-efficacy,"

93
0:05:09.859,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the sense that you can change the world

94
0:05:12.771,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and that you can attain what you set out to do.

95
0:05:16.717,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me,

96
0:05:19.505,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because I realized that this famous scientist

97
0:05:23.062,000 --> 0:05:26,000
had documented and scientifically validated

98
0:05:26.246,000 --> 0:05:29,000
something that we've seen happen for the last 30 years:

99
0:05:29.661,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative,

100
0:05:33.474,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and we could take them through a series of steps,

101
0:05:36.224,000 --> 0:05:39,000
kind of like a series of small successes,

102
0:05:39.644,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they turn fear into familiarity.

103
0:05:43.575,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And they surprise themselves.

104
0:05:45.074,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That transformation is amazing.

105
0:05:47.101,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We see it at the d.school all the time.

106
0:05:49.521,000 --> 0:05:51,000
People from all different kinds of disciplines,

107
0:05:52.251,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they think of themselves as only analytical.

108
0:05:54.766,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And they come in and they go through the process, our process,

109
0:05:58.294,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently.

110
0:06:01.5,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around

111
0:06:06.589,000 --> 0:06:08,000
thinking of themselves as a creative person.

112
0:06:10.826,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So I thought one of the things I'd do today

113
0:06:12.906,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is take you through and show you what this journey looks like.

114
0:06:16.738,000 --> 0:06:2,000
To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.

115
0:06:23.486,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Doug Dietz is a technical person.

116
0:06:25.424,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He designs large medical imaging equipment.

117
0:06:29.692,000 --> 0:06:32,000
He's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career.

118
0:06:33.502,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But at one point, he had a moment of crisis.

119
0:06:36.326,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use,

120
0:06:40.423,000 --> 0:06:43,000
when he saw a young family, and this little girl.

121
0:06:44.047,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that little girl was crying and was terrified.

122
0:06:47.523,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And Doug was really disappointed to learn

123
0:06:50.902,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital

124
0:06:54.781,000 --> 0:06:57,000
had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.

125
0:07:00.325,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And this was really disappointing to Doug,

126
0:07:02.428,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because before this time, he was proud of what he did.

127
0:07:05.105,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He was saving lives with this machine.

128
0:07:07.697,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids.

129
0:07:12.698,000 --> 0:07:16,000
About that time, he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes.

130
0:07:17.182,000 --> 0:07:21,000
He was learning about our process, about design thinking, about empathy,

131
0:07:21.857,000 --> 0:07:22,000
about iterative prototyping.

132
0:07:23.706,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary.

133
0:07:28.419,000 --> 0:07:31,000
He would redesign the entire experience

134
0:07:32.18,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of being scanned.

135
0:07:33.82,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this is what he came up with.

136
0:07:35.443,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:36.486,000 --> 0:07:38,000
He turned it into an adventure for the kids.

138
0:07:39.083,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He painted the walls and he painted the machine,

139
0:07:41.365,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids,

140
0:07:44.168,000 --> 0:07:46,000
like children's museum people.

141
0:07:46.702,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And now when the kid comes, it's an experience.

142
0:07:50.424,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship.

143
0:07:54.054,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And when they come, they say,

144
0:07:55.475,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"OK, you're going to go into the pirate ship,

145
0:07:57.626,000 --> 0:08:,000
but be very still, because we don't want the pirates to find you."

146
0:08:02.574,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And the results were super dramatic:

147
0:08:06.234,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated,

148
0:08:09.408,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated.

149
0:08:13.686,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the hospital and GE were happy, too,

150
0:08:15.749,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time,

151
0:08:18.932,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and they could put more kids through the machine in a day.

152
0:08:21.764,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So the quantitative results were great.

153
0:08:23.695,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative.

154
0:08:27.723,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He was with one of the mothers

155
0:08:29.473,000 --> 0:08:31,000
waiting for her child to come out of the scan.

156
0:08:31.807,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And when the little girl came out of her scan,

157
0:08:34.197,000 --> 0:08:35,000
she ran up to her mother and said,

158
0:08:36.117,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"

159
0:08:38.081,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:41.306,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And so, I've heard Doug tell the story many times

161
0:08:44.751,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of his personal transformation

162
0:08:47.061,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and the breakthrough design that happened from it,

163
0:08:50.431,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl

164
0:08:53.566,000 --> 0:08:54,000
without a tear in his eye.

165
0:08:55.315,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Doug's story takes place in a hospital.

166
0:08:58.281,000 --> 0:09:,000
I know a thing or two about hospitals.

167
0:09:01.73,000 --> 0:09:04,000
A few years ago, I felt a lump on the side of my neck.

168
0:09:06.471,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It was my turn in the MRI machine.

169
0:09:09.224,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It was cancer, it was the bad kind.

170
0:09:12.208,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival.

171
0:09:16.163,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So while you're sitting around with the other patients,

172
0:09:19.093,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in your pajamas,

173
0:09:20.341,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and everybody's pale and thin --

174
0:09:22.393,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

175
0:09:23.433,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you know? -- and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays,

176
0:09:26.722,000 --> 0:09:27,000
you think of a lot of things.

177
0:09:28.398,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Mostly, you think about: Am I going to survive?

178
0:09:31.641,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I thought a lot about:

179
0:09:32.933,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What was my daughter's life going to be like without me?

180
0:09:37.756,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But you think about other things.

181
0:09:40.198,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I thought a lot about: What was I put on Earth to do?

182
0:09:43.208,000 --> 0:09:46,000
What was my calling? What should I do?

183
0:09:46.623,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I was lucky because I had lots of options.

184
0:09:48.695,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We'd been working in health and wellness,

185
0:09:50.678,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and K-12, and the developing world.

186
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:54,000
so there were lots of projects that I could work on.

187
0:09:55.872,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But then I decided and committed at this point,

188
0:09:58.214,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to the thing I most wanted to do,

189
0:10:01.494,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which was to help as many people as possible

190
0:10:05.209,000 --> 0:10:08,000
regain the creative confidence they lost along their way.

191
0:10:09.082,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do.

192
0:10:11.93,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I survived, just so you know.

193
0:10:13.415,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

194
0:10:15.51,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

195
0:10:22.243,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I really believe that when people gain this confidence --

196
0:10:26.172,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO --

197
0:10:29.197,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that they actually start working on the things

198
0:10:32.019,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that are really important in their lives.

199
0:10:34.03,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions.

200
0:10:37.765,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We see them come up with more interesting -- and just more -- ideas,

201
0:10:44.238,000 --> 0:10:46,000
so they can choose from better ideas.

202
0:10:47.165,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And they just make better decisions.

203
0:10:49.758,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I know at TED, you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing,

204
0:10:53.275,000 --> 0:10:55,000
isn't that -- everybody has a change-the-world thing?

205
0:10:55.999,000 --> 0:10:58,000
If there is one for me, this is it, to help this happen.

206
0:10:59.15,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I hope you'll join me on my quest,

207
0:11:01.914,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you as, kind of, thought leaders.

208
0:11:03.548,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world

209
0:11:07.813,000 --> 0:11:1,000
into the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing,

210
0:11:11.799,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and to have people realize that they're naturally creative,

211
0:11:16.309,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and that those natural people should let their ideas fly;

212
0:11:20.925,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy,

213
0:11:25.125,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that you can do what you set out to do,

214
0:11:28.412,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and that you can reach a place of creative confidence

215
0:11:32.124,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and touch the snake.

216
0:11:33.832,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Thank you.

217
0:11:35.008,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.

3
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
These Gapminder bubbles show you

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or how we estimate that it was.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What we are showing here is --

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that shows how many are infected in each country,

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the color is the continent.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, you can see United States, in 1983,

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
had a very low percentage infected,

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There were quite many people infected in the United States.

16
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And, up there, you see Uganda.

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They had almost five percent infected,

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And they were probably the most infected country in the world.

20
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, what has happened?

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now you have understood the graph

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and now, in the next 60 seconds,

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.

24
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But first, I have a new invention here.

25
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.

27
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So, ready, steady, go!

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.

31
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They went upwards like this.

32
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they reached one to two percent.

34
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Then, Uganda started to turn back,

35
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,

36
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.

37
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Look, India got many infected,

38
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but had a low level.

39
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And almost the same happens here.

40
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,

41
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Russia went to one percent.

42
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In the last two to three years,

43
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.

44
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
25 years it took.

45
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,

46
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it's just that they have stopped getting worse.

47
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And it has -- the steady state is, more or less,

48
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It means 30 to 40 million people,

50
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the whole of California -- every person,

51
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that's more or less what we have today in the world.

52
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa,

54
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
democratic government, good economy,

55
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and this is what happened there.

56
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They started low, they skyrocketed,

57
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they peaked up there in 2003,

58
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and now they are down.

59
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But they are falling only slowly,

60
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,

61
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they can manage to treat people.

62
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.

63
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
These percentages won't come down

64
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because people can survive 10 to 20 years.

65
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So there's some problem with these metrics now.

66
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,

67
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,

68
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because people still die.

69
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,

70
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
all people are not reached by treatment,

71
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,

72
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.

73
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's not realistic with lifelong treatment

74
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for everyone in the poorest countries.

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But it's very good that what is done is being done.

76
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But focus now is back on prevention.

77
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It is only by stopping the transmission

78
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that the world will be able to deal with it.

79
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,

80
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --

81
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but the drugs are very costly for the poor.

82
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Not the drug in itself, but the treatment

83
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and the care which is needed around it.

84
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, when we look at the pattern,

85
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
one thing comes out very clearly:

86
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you see the blue bubbles

87
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and people say HIV is very high in Africa.

88
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.

89
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world

90
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in African countries,

91
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --

92
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the same rate as United States.

93
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And you'll find Madagascar,

94
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and you'll find a lot of African countries

95
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
about as low as the rest of the world.

96
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa

97
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and things go on in one way in Africa.

98
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We have to stop that.

99
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever

100
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to think that way.

101
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

102
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.

103
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.

104
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference.

106
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, why is it so high? Is it war?

107
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
No, it's not. Look here.

108
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent.

109
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.

110
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --

111
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they have two, three percent infected,

112
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.

113
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
There are now studies clearly showing

114
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,

115
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.

116
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So, is it poverty?

117
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Well if you look at the macro level,

118
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it seems more money, more HIV.

119
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But that's very simplistic,

120
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so let's go down and look at Tanzania.

121
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I will split Tanzania in five income groups,

122
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
from the highest income to the lowest income,

123
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and here we go.

124
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --

125
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
they have higher HIV.

126
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,

127
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it is even bigger among women.

128
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,

129
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
done by African institutions and researchers

130
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.

131
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.

132
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.

133
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Look here at Kenya.

134
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I've split Kenya in its provinces.

135
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Here it goes.

136
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
See the difference within one African country --

137
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it goes from very low level to very high level,

138
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.

139
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, what is it then?

140
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?

141
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Well, it is more common with multiple partners,

142
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
there is less condom use,

143
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and there is age-disparate sex --

144
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.

145
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men

146
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in many of these highly affected countries.

147
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But where are they situated?

148
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I will swap the bubbles to a map.

149
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population

150
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.

151
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
HIV exists all over the world.

152
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.

153
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Brazil has many HIV-infected.

154
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.

155
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.

156
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
India has many because they are many.

157
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Southeast Asia, and so on.

158
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But, there is one part of Africa --

159
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and the difficult thing is, at the same time,

160
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
not to make a uniform statement about Africa,

161
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.

162
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,

163
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.

164
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
UNAIDS have done good data available, finally,

165
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
about the spread of HIV.

166
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It could be concurrency.

167
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It could be some virus types.

168
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It could be that there is other things

169
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.

170
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,

171
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.

172
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to

173
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
behave tonight and so on.

174
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,

176
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.

177
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But what we think is that it could be concurrency.

178
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And what is concurrency?

179
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.

180
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We have serial monogamy.

181
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.

182
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.

183
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?

184
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And you collect a big number of exes.

185
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic --

186
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.

187
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection

188
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month

189
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is much more dangerous for HIV than others.

190
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Probably, it's a combination of this.

191
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now

192
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
towards fact when we look at this.

193
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You can get this chart, free.

194
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.

195
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future

196
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we will not only have the heart,

197
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we will not only have the money,

198
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but we will also use the brain.

199
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Thank you very much.

200
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Applause)

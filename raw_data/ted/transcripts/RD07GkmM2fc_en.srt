1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a garbage man.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because I absolutely hate waste.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I hope, within the next 10 minutes,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to change the way you think

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about a lot of the stuff in your life.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Think back when you were just a kid.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
How did look at the stuff in your life?

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's my stuff if I saw it first.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The more stuff that's mine, the better.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it's become pretty clear to me

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as we develop into adults.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Because each and every day

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at our recycling plants around the world

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we handle about one million pounds

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of people's discarded stuff.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that are disposed each and every year around the world --

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
well less than one percent.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In fact, the United Nations estimates

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that there's about 85 billion pounds a year

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of electronics waste

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that gets discarded around the world each and every year --

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that number well more than doubles.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And of course, the more developed the country,

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the bigger these mountains.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now when you see these mountains,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
most people think of garbage.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We see above-ground mines.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And it's becoming increasingly important

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that we figure out how to extract these raw materials

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from these extremely complicated waste streams.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Because as we've heard all week at TED,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who want more and more stuff.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And of course, they want the toys and the tools

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that many of us take for granted.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And what goes into making those toys and tools

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that we use every single day?

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And the metals, we typically get

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
from ore that we mine

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in ever widening mines

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and ever deepening mines around the world.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And the plastics, we get from oil,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which we go to more remote locations

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and drill ever deeper wells to extract.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And these practices have

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
significant economic and environmental implications

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that we're already starting to see today.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that have recycling policies in place

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that require that this stuff be recycled

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in a responsible manner.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
To put that in perspective --

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because it's the most common metal --

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if your stuff makes it to a recycler,

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
probably over 90 percent of the metals

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Plastics are a whole other story:

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
well less than 10 percent are recovered.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In fact, it's more like five percent.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
have very little value.

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And there's more plastics produced and consumed

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
around the world on a volume basis

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
every year than steel.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not recovered at anywhere near the rate

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of the less valuable material?

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Well it's predominantly because

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
metals are very easy to recycle

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from other materials and from one another.

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They have very different densities.

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And they even have different colors.

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So it's very easy for either humans or machines

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to separate these metals

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
from one another and from other materials.

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They have either identical or very similar

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
electrical and magnetic properties.

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And any plastic can be any color,

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
as you probably well know.

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So the traditional ways of separating materials

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just simply don't work for plastics.

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and sadly to say, particularly from the United States,

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
finds its way to developing countries

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for low-cost recycling.

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals --

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
circuit boards and so forth --

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,

117
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which is, again, mostly the plastics.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
in burn houses like you see here.

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And they extract the metals by hand.

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
this is certainly not the low-environmental

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or human health-and-safety solution.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I call this environmental arbitrage.

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And it's not fair, it's not safe

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it's not sustainable.

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now because the plastics are so plentiful --

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and by the way,

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously --

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but people do try to recover the plastics.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is just one example.

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They store the plastics on the roofs.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and people try very hard to separate the plastics,

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
by color, by shape, by feel,

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
by any technique they can.

139
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to try to determine the type of plastic.

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling

143
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
in any significant way.

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And by the way,

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
please don't try this technique at home.

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So what are we to do about this space-age material,

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to keep putting back in the ground

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or certainly send up in smoke.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
trying to figure out how to separate

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
these very similar materials from each other,

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,

156
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And we eventually broke the code.

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This is the last frontier of recycling.

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's the last major material

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And we finally figured out how to do it.

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And in the process, we started recreating

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
how the plastics industry makes plastics.

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The traditional way to make plastics

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is with oil or petrochemicals.

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.

170
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,

171
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Well a good place to start is with waste.

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,

174
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and it's plentiful,

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.

176
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and recombining them,

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We have significantly lower capital costs

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in our plant equipment.

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We have enormous energy savings.

182
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now

183
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
compared to making something the traditional way.

185
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars

186
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to build a chemical plant

187
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And we make a drop-in replacement

190
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.

191
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Our customers get to enjoy

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
huge CO2 savings.

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They get to close the loop with their products.

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And they get to make more sustainable products.

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In the short time period I have,

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They recover the metals

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --

200
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a very complex mixture of materials,

201
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but predominantly plastics.

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We take out the things that aren't plastics,

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,

204
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
wood, glass, paper, you name it.

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,

208
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we're using air classification.

209
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.

210
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:

211
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
many different types of plastics

212
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and many different grades of plastics.

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We use a very highly automated process

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to sort those plastics,

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
not only by type, but by grade.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And out the end of that part of the process

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
come little flakes of plastic:

221
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
one type, one grade.

222
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.

223
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We push that material to extruders where we melt it,

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
push it through small die holes,

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
make spaghetti-like plastic strands.

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And we chop those strands

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
into what are called pellets.

229
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is the same material

231
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that you would get from oil.

232
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And today,

233
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we're producing it from your old stuff,

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it's going right back into your new stuff.

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Applause)

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So now, instead of your stuff ending up

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
on a hillside in a developing country

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or literally going up in smoke,

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you can find your old stuff

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
back on top of your desk in new products,

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in your office,

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
or back at work in your home.

243
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And these are just a few examples

244
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of companies that are buying our plastic,

245
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
replacing virgin plastic,

246
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to make their new products.

247
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So I hope I've changed the way you look at

248
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
at least some of the stuff in your life.

249
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We took our clues from mother nature.

250
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Mother nature wastes very little,

251
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
reuses practically everything.

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --

253
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that's a label I've always hated my entire life --

254
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
until they can be transformed to another form

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for another use later in time.

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And finally, I hope you agree with me

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to change that last toddler rule just a little bit

259
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Thank you for your time.

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

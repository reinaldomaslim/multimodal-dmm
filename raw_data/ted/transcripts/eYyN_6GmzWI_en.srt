1
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This means, "I'm smiling."

2
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So does that.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This means "mouse."

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"Cat."

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Here we have a story.

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The start of the story, where this means guy,

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.

8
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Here's where it happens.

9
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
These are when.

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

11
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
She wears it every day.

12
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's not considered vintage --

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

15
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's because she dances.

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

20
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
or "I heart you!"

21
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"I'm laughing out loud."

22
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"I want to give you a hug."

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But he comes up with that, you know.

24
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."

25
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Put a crab inside it.

27
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Add some water.

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Seven different salts.

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,

30
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but just panhandle at the ocean.

31
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."

32
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

33
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

34
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

35
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
At least, that's how it seems.

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

38
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

39
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm a monkey --

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter) --

41
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
blowing kisses

42
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
at a butterfly.

43
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

44
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
First, soon, and then a lot.

45
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

46
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

47
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Hell, ponytail alone.

48
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I don't know what else to tell you.

49
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I got a pencil you can borrow.

50
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You can put it in your phone."

51
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

52
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
She just says, "No thank you."

53
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You know?

54
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]

55
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

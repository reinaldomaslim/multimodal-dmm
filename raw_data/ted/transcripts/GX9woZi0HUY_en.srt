1
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Everyone has a story,

2
0:00:15.333,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and that story is filled with chapters

3
0:00:18.292,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that have made us who we are today.

4
0:00:22.458,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Those early chapters of that story

5
0:00:25.708,000 --> 0:00:28,000
sometimes are the ones that define us the most.

6
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The Center for Disease Control

7
0:00:32.333,000 --> 0:00:35,000
has estimated that over half of our nation's children

8
0:00:36.125,000 --> 0:00:4,000
have experienced at least one or two types of childhood trauma.

9
0:00:41.375,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That adversity can have lasting effects.

10
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I began to have opportunities to speak

11
0:00:49.208,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and advocate for students and for teachers,

12
0:00:52.542,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I found myself uniquely positioned

13
0:00:55.792,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to be able to speak about childhood trauma.

14
0:00:59.583,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But I had to make a decision first.

15
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I had to decide,

16
0:01:03.792,000 --> 0:01:06,000
did I want to just share the bright and shiny parts of my life,

17
0:01:07.375,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you know, those ones that we put out on social media

18
0:01:10.333,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that make us all look perfect,

19
0:01:13.042,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or did I want to make myself vulnerable

20
0:01:17.708,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and become an open book?

21
0:01:20.458,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The choice became very clear.

22
0:01:23.125,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In order to make a difference in the life of a child,

23
0:01:25.958,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I had to become transparent.

24
0:01:29.833,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I made the commitment to tell my personal story.

25
0:01:34.625,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And this story is filled with people that have loved me

26
0:01:38.958,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and taken care of me and grown me.

27
0:01:41.792,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And have helped me overcome and heal.

28
0:01:45.375,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And now it's time for me to help others do the same.

29
0:01:51.958,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When I first started school, I was the picture of normalcy.

30
0:01:56.042,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was from a good family,

31
0:01:58.667,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was always dressed nicely,

32
0:02:01.042,000 --> 0:02:03,000
had a smile on my face,

33
0:02:03.375,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I was prepared for school.

34
0:02:06.25,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But my life was anything but normal.

35
0:02:09.917,000 --> 0:02:13,000
By this time, I had already become a victim of sexual abuse.

36
0:02:15.667,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And it was still happening.

37
0:02:19.083,000 --> 0:02:21,000
My parents didn't know,

38
0:02:21.333,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I had not told anyone else.

39
0:02:25.583,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When I started school, I felt like this was going to be my safe place.

40
0:02:31.875,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So I was excited.

41
0:02:34.292,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Imagine my dismay when I met my teacher,

42
0:02:40.542,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Mr. Randolph.

43
0:02:42.875,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now Mr. Randolph was not my abuser.

44
0:02:46.667,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But Mr. Randolph was the epitome

45
0:02:50.25,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of everything that scared me the most in my life.

46
0:02:55.333,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I had already started these self-preservation techniques

47
0:02:59.458,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to where I took myself out of positions where I was going to be alone with a man.

48
0:03:05.375,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And here I was, as a student,

49
0:03:09.167,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I was going to be in a classroom with a man every day,

50
0:03:12.417,000 --> 0:03:14,000
for a year of school.

51
0:03:16.208,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I was scared; I didn't trust him.

52
0:03:20.125,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But you know what,

53
0:03:21.417,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Mr. Randolph would turn out to be my greatest advocate.

54
0:03:25.375,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But in the beginning,

55
0:03:27.167,000 --> 0:03:3,000
oh, I made sure he knew I did not like him.

56
0:03:30.917,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I was noncompliant;

57
0:03:33.292,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I was that kid that was disengaged.

58
0:03:37.75,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I also made it really hard on my parents, too.

59
0:03:42.167,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I didn't want to go to school,

60
0:03:43.667,000 --> 0:03:46,000
so I fought them every morning, getting on the bus.

61
0:03:47.167,000 --> 0:03:48,000
At night, I couldn't sleep,

62
0:03:48.917,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because my anxiety was so high.

63
0:03:52.083,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I was going into class exhausted.

64
0:03:55.75,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Which, exhausted children are cranky children,

65
0:04:00.25,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they're not easy to teach,

66
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you know that.

67
0:04:04.167,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Mr. Randolph could have approached me with frustration,

68
0:04:08.875,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like so many teachers do with students like me.

69
0:04:13.667,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But not him.

70
0:04:15.5,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He approached me with empathy

71
0:04:19.208,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and with flexibility.

72
0:04:21.917,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I was so grateful for that.

73
0:04:24.792,000 --> 0:04:28,000
He saw this six-year-old was tired and weary.

74
0:04:29.708,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And so instead of making me go outside for recess,

75
0:04:32.583,000 --> 0:04:34,000
he would let me stay in and take naps,

76
0:04:34.875,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because he knew I needed rest.

77
0:04:39.208,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Instead of sitting at the teacher table at lunch,

78
0:04:42.875,000 --> 0:04:45,000
he would come and sit with the students at the student table.

79
0:04:46.333,000 --> 0:04:5,000
He would engage me and all my classmates in conversation.

80
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I now look back and I know

81
0:04:54.375,000 --> 0:04:55,000
he had a purpose for that,

82
0:04:55.792,000 --> 0:04:58,000
he was listening, he was asking questions.

83
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:01,000
He needed to find out what was going on.

84
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
He built a relationship with me.

85
0:05:05.917,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He earned my trust.

86
0:05:08.583,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And slowly but surely,

87
0:05:09.875,000 --> 0:05:11,000
those walls that I had built around myself

88
0:05:12.458,000 --> 0:05:13,000
he started chipping away at,

89
0:05:14.417,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I eventually realized he was one of the good guys.

90
0:05:20.917,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I know that he felt like he wasn't enough.

91
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Because he made the move to talk to my mom.

92
0:05:31.542,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And got my mom's permission

93
0:05:33.625,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to let me start seeing a school guidance counselor,

94
0:05:37.292,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Ms. McFadyen.

95
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I started seeing Ms. McFadyen once or twice a week

96
0:05:42.833,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for the next two years.

97
0:05:44.958,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It was a process.

98
0:05:47.875,000 --> 0:05:48,000
During that time period,

99
0:05:49.167,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I never disclosed to her the abuse,

100
0:05:51.542,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because it was a secret;

101
0:05:54.208,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I wasn't supposed to tell.

102
0:05:56.458,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But she connected the dots, I know she did,

103
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because everything that she did with me

104
0:06:02.417,000 --> 0:06:05,000
was to empower me and help me find my voice.

105
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:08,000
She taught me how to use mental images

106
0:06:09.708,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to push through my fears.

107
0:06:12.583,000 --> 0:06:14,000
She taught me breathing techniques

108
0:06:14.625,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to help me get through those anxiety attacks

109
0:06:17.417,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that I would have so often.

110
0:06:20.083,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And she role-played with me.

111
0:06:23.042,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And she made sure

112
0:06:24.333,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that I could stand up for myself in situations.

113
0:06:29.25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And the day came

114
0:06:30.833,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where I was in the room with my abuser

115
0:06:33.375,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and one other adult.

116
0:06:35.875,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I told my truth.

117
0:06:39.208,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I told about the abuse.

118
0:06:42.792,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Immediately, my abuser began to deny,

119
0:06:46.875,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the person I disclosed to,

120
0:06:49.917,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they just weren't equipped to handle the bombshell

121
0:06:52.708,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that I had just dropped on them.

122
0:06:55.583,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It was easier to believe the abuser

123
0:06:59.25,000 --> 0:07:,000
rather than a child.

124
0:07:02.208,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So I was told never to speak of it again.

125
0:07:07.167,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I was made to feel like I had done something wrong, again.

126
0:07:13.375,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It was devastating.

127
0:07:17.25,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But you know what,

128
0:07:18.542,000 --> 0:07:19,000
something good came out of that day.

129
0:07:20.417,000 --> 0:07:23,000
My abuser knew that I was no longer going to be silent.

130
0:07:25.125,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The power shifted.

131
0:07:27.25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And the abuse stopped.

132
0:07:30.625,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

133
0:07:37.5,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But the shame

134
0:07:39.708,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and fear of it happening again

135
0:07:43.125,000 --> 0:07:44,000
remained.

136
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it would remain with me

137
0:07:46.792,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for many, many years to come.

138
0:07:51.583,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Mr. Randolph and Ms. McFadyen,

139
0:07:54.917,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they helped me find my voice.

140
0:07:59.875,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They helped me find the light out.

141
0:08:05.667,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But you know what,

142
0:08:06.958,000 --> 0:08:09,000
there are so many kids that aren't as fortunate as me.

143
0:08:10.125,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And you have them in your classrooms.

144
0:08:13.208,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That is why it's so important for me to talk to you today,

145
0:08:16.833,000 --> 0:08:18,000
so you can be aware

146
0:08:18.958,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and you can start asking the questions that need to be asked

147
0:08:22.875,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and paying attention to these students,

148
0:08:25.833,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so you too can help them find their way.

149
0:08:31.583,000 --> 0:08:33,000
As a kindergarten teacher,

150
0:08:33.667,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I start my year off

151
0:08:35.583,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with my kids making box biographies.

152
0:08:40.208,000 --> 0:08:42,000
These are two of my students.

153
0:08:42.625,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I encourage them

154
0:08:44.542,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to fill those boxes with things that tell me about them

155
0:08:48.292,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and about their life,

156
0:08:49.583,000 --> 0:08:51,000
what's important to you, you know?

157
0:08:52.5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They decorate them,

158
0:08:54.083,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I mean, they really take time,

159
0:08:56.25,000 --> 0:09:,000
they fill them with pictures of their families and of their pets,

160
0:09:00.792,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and then I let them present them to me and to the class.

161
0:09:05.333,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And during that time, I am an active listener.

162
0:09:09.417,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Because the things they say,

163
0:09:11.917,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the facial expressions that they give me,

164
0:09:15.042,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the things they don't say

165
0:09:18.708,000 --> 0:09:2,000
can become red flags for me

166
0:09:21.333,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and can help me figure out what their needs are.

167
0:09:25.125,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What is driving them

168
0:09:27.917,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to maybe have the behaviors that they're showing me in class.

169
0:09:32.375,000 --> 0:09:34,000
How can I be a better teacher

170
0:09:34.792,000 --> 0:09:36,000
by listening to their voices?

171
0:09:38.083,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I also make times to develop relationships with them,

172
0:09:41.458,000 --> 0:09:43,000
much like Mr. Randolph did with me.

173
0:09:43.792,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I sit with them at lunch,

174
0:09:45.375,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I have conversations with them at recess,

175
0:09:48.333,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I go to their games on the weekends,

176
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I go to their dance recitals.

177
0:09:53.125,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I become a part of their life.

178
0:09:55.583,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Because in order to really know a student,

179
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
you've got to infuse yourself into their lives.

180
0:10:03.458,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now I know some of you are middle school teachers

181
0:10:06.25,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and high school teachers,

182
0:10:08.125,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and you might think that those kids

183
0:10:10.917,000 --> 0:10:13,000
have already kind of developed, and you know,

184
0:10:14.167,000 --> 0:10:16,000
they're on autopilot at that point.

185
0:10:17.042,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But don't be deceived.

186
0:10:18.917,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Especially the kids that you think have it all together,

187
0:10:21.583,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because those are the ones that might need you the most.

188
0:10:26.042,000 --> 0:10:27,000
If you were to look at my yearbook,

189
0:10:27.833,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you would see me on about every page,

190
0:10:30.083,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because I was involved in everything.

191
0:10:34.5,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I even drove a school bus.

192
0:10:36.167,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughs)

193
0:10:37.583,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So I was that kid

194
0:10:39.375,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that teachers thought was the overachiever,

195
0:10:42.125,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the popular person,

196
0:10:43.667,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the one that had it together.

197
0:10:46.958,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But guys, I was lost.

198
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I was lost,

199
0:10:51.417,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and I wanted someone to ask me,

200
0:10:54.417,000 --> 0:10:56,000
"Lisa, why are you here all the time,

201
0:10:56.542,000 --> 0:10:59,000
why are you throwing yourself into all these things?"

202
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Did they ever wonder,

203
0:11:02.708,000 --> 0:11:04,000
was I running away from someone,

204
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
was I running away from something?

205
0:11:07.917,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Why did I not want to be in my community

206
0:11:11.75,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or in my home?

207
0:11:13.208,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Why did I want to be at school all the time?

208
0:11:17.375,000 --> 0:11:19,000
No one ever asked.

209
0:11:20.958,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now don't get me wrong,

210
0:11:22.542,000 --> 0:11:24,000
all overachievers in your schools

211
0:11:24.75,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are not victims of abuse or trauma.

212
0:11:28.25,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But I just want you to take the time to be curious.

213
0:11:33.25,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Ask them why.

214
0:11:36.458,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You may find out that there is a reason behind it.

215
0:11:40.208,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You could be the reason that they move forward

216
0:11:45.5,000 --> 0:11:47,000
with their story.

217
0:11:49.208,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Be careful not to assume

218
0:11:51.708,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that you already know the ending to their story.

219
0:11:54.625,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Don't put a period where a semicolon should be.

220
0:11:58.333,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Keep that story going

221
0:11:59.875,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and help them know that even if something has happened traumatic to them,

222
0:12:04.5,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that their life is still worth telling.

223
0:12:08.208,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Their story is worth telling.

224
0:12:13.625,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now in order to do that,

225
0:12:15.958,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I really feel like we have to embrace our own personal stories as educators.

226
0:12:21.75,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Many of you might be sitting there

227
0:12:24.083,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and thinking, "Yeah.

228
0:12:27.542,000 --> 0:12:28,000
That happened to me.

229
0:12:29.5,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But I'm not ready to share."

230
0:12:32.167,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And that's OK.

231
0:12:34.667,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The time will come

232
0:12:36.542,000 --> 0:12:39,000
when you will feel it inside your soul

233
0:12:39.583,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that it's time to turn your past pain

234
0:12:43.125,000 --> 0:12:45,000
into purpose for the future.

235
0:12:45.917,000 --> 0:12:47,000
These children are our future.

236
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I just encourage you to take it day by day.

237
0:12:53.417,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Talk to someone.

238
0:12:55.583,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Be willing and just open.

239
0:13:00.042,000 --> 0:13:03,000
My life story came full circle

240
0:13:03.625,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in the spring of 2018,

241
0:13:06.667,000 --> 0:13:07,000
where I was invited to speak

242
0:13:08.333,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to a group of beginning teachers and mentors.

243
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I shared my story, much like today with you,

244
0:13:15.292,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and afterwards I had a lady approach me.

245
0:13:19.333,000 --> 0:13:23,000
She had tears in her eyes and she quietly said, "Thank you.

246
0:13:24.208,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Thank you for sharing.

247
0:13:26.667,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I cannot wait to tell my dad

248
0:13:30.583,000 --> 0:13:32,000
everything that I heard today."

249
0:13:33.625,000 --> 0:13:36,000
She must have seen the perplexed look on my face,

250
0:13:37.125,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because she followed up by saying,

251
0:13:40.125,000 --> 0:13:42,000
"Mr. Randolph is my dad."

252
0:13:42.333,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Audience: Aww.

253
0:13:44.667,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Lisa Godwin: "And he often wonders:

254
0:13:48.583,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Did he make a difference?

255
0:13:51.833,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Today, I get to go home and tell him,

256
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
'You definitely made a difference.'"

257
0:13:57.833,000 --> 0:13:58,000
What a gift.

258
0:13:59.583,000 --> 0:14:01,000
What a gift.

259
0:14:01.625,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And that prompted me

260
0:14:03.208,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to reach out to Ms. McFadyen's daughter as well,

261
0:14:06.25,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and to share with her

262
0:14:08.208,000 --> 0:14:11,000
what an impact Ms. McFadyen had made.

263
0:14:11.542,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And I wanted her to know

264
0:14:13.375,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I have advocated for more funding

265
0:14:16.25,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for guidance counselors, for school social workers,

266
0:14:19.5,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for psychologists, for nurses,

267
0:14:21.417,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because they are so vital to the mental and physical health

268
0:14:25.875,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of our children.

269
0:14:27.75,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I'm thankful for Ms. McFadyen.

270
0:14:29.75,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

271
0:14:34.167,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I once heard someone say,

272
0:14:36.958,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in order to find your way out of the darkness,

273
0:14:39.667,000 --> 0:14:41,000
you have to find the light.

274
0:14:42.792,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Today, I hope that you leave this place

275
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and you seek opportunities to be the light.

276
0:14:50.292,000 --> 0:14:51,000
For not only students

277
0:14:52.042,000 --> 0:14:55,000
but for adults in your classrooms,

278
0:14:55.25,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in your schools, in your communities.

279
0:14:58.672,000 --> 0:15:,000
You have the gift

280
0:15:01.667,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to help someone navigate

281
0:15:05.292,000 --> 0:15:07,000
through their trauma

282
0:15:07.833,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and make their story worth telling.

283
0:15:11.958,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Thank you.

284
0:15:13.25,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Good evening, welcome to New Orleans.

2
0:00:16.24,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I don't know if you knew this,

3
0:00:17.8,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but you are sitting within 15 minutes of one of the largest rivers in the world:

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the Mississippi river.

5
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Old Man River, Big Muddy.

6
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it goes as far north as the state of Minnesota,

7
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as far east as the state of New York,

8
0:00:38.44,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as far west as Montana.

9
0:00:42.12,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And 100 miles from here, river miles,

10
0:00:45.48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it empties its fresh water and sediments into the Gulf of Mexico.

11
0:00:51.08,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That's the end of Geography 101.

12
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now we're going to go to what is in that water.

14
0:00:59.36,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Besides the sediment, there are dissolved molecules, nitrogen and phosphorus.

15
0:01:06.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And those, through a biological process,

16
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:15,000
lead to the formation of areas called dead zones.

17
0:01:16.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, dead zone is a quite ominous word

18
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:23,000
if you're a fish or a crab.

19
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:25.52,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Even a little worm in the sediments.

21
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Which means that there's not enough oxygen

22
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for those animals to survive.

23
0:01:35.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So, how does this happen?

24
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The nitrogen and the phosphorus

25
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
stimulate the growth of microscopic plants called phytoplankton.

26
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And small animals called zooplankton eat the phytoplankton,

27
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
small fish eat the zooplankton, large fish eat the small fish

28
0:01:55.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and it goes on up into the food web.

29
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The problem is that there's just too much nitrogen and phosphorus right now,

30
0:02:02.68,000 --> 0:02:05,000
too much phytoplankton falling to the bottom

31
0:02:05.92,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and decomposed by bacteria that use up the oxygen.

32
0:02:11.44,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's the biology.

33
0:02:13.88,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, you can't see it from the surface of the water,

34
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you can't see it in satellite images,

35
0:02:19.76,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so how do we know it's there?

36
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Well, a trawler can tell you,

37
0:02:24.76,000 --> 0:02:28,000
when she puts her net over the side and drags for 20 minutes

38
0:02:29.12,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and comes up empty,

39
0:02:30.96,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that she knows she's in the dead zone.

40
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And she has to go somewhere else.

41
0:02:35.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But where else do you go if this area is 8,000 square miles big?

42
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:43,000
About the size of the state of New Jersey.

43
0:02:44.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Well, you either make a decision to go further,

44
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
without much economic return,

45
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or go back to the dock.

46
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment

47
0:02:58.12,000 --> 0:03:,000
that we can put over the side of the research vessel,

48
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and it measures oxygen and many more things.

49
0:03:03.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We start at the Mississippi River,

50
0:03:06.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we crisscross the Gulf of Mexico all the way to Texas,

51
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and even I sneak into Texas every now and then and test their waters.

52
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And you can tell by the bottom oxygen --

53
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you can draw a map of everything that's less than two,

54
0:03:23.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which is the magic number for when the fish start to leave the area.

55
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I also dive in this dead zone.

56
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We have oxygen meters that we have to deploy offshore

57
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that tell us continuous measurements of low oxygen or high oxygen.

58
0:03:42.36,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And when you get into the water, there's a lot of fish.

59
0:03:45.96,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Tons of fish, all kinds of fish,

60
0:03:47.88,000 --> 0:03:51,000
including my buddy here, the barracuda that I saw one day.

61
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Everybody else swam this way and I went this way with my camera.

62
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then, down at 30 feet you start to see fewer fish.

64
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And then you get to the bottom.

65
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And you don't see any fish.

66
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There's no life on the platform, there's no life swimming around.

67
0:04:11.32,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And you know you're in the dead zone.

68
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So, what's the connection between the middle of the United States

69
0:04:19.32,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the Gulf of Mexico?

70
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Well, most of the watershed is farmland.

71
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And in particular, corn-soybean rotation.

72
0:04:30.959,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The nitrogen that is put in fertilizers and the phosphorus goes on the land

73
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and drains off into the Mississippi River

74
0:04:39.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico.

75
0:04:42.44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There's three times more nitrogen in the water

76
0:04:47.28,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the Mississippi now,

77
0:04:49.08,000 --> 0:04:51,000
than there was in the 1950s.

78
0:04:51.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Three times.

79
0:04:52.76,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And phosphorus has doubled.

80
0:04:54.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And what that means is more phytoplankton and more sinking sails and lower oxygen.

81
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This is not a natural feature of the Gulf; it's been caused by human activities.

82
0:05:06.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The landscape is not what it used to be.

83
0:05:08.68,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It used to be prairies and forests and prairie potholes

84
0:05:13.64,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and duck areas and all kinds of stuff.

85
0:05:17.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But not anymore -- it's row crops.

86
0:05:20.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And there are ways that we can address this type of agriculture

87
0:05:25.76,000 --> 0:05:3,000
by using less fertilizer, maybe precision fertilizing.

88
0:05:31.08,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And trying some sustainable agriculture

89
0:05:34.52,000 --> 0:05:38,000
such as perennial wheatgrass, which has much longer roots

90
0:05:39.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
than the six inches of a corn plant,

91
0:05:41.72,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that can keep the nitrogen on the soil and keep the soil from running off.

92
0:05:47.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And how do we convince our neighbors to the north,

93
0:05:51.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
maybe 1,000 miles away or more,

94
0:05:54.76,000 --> 0:06:,000
that their activities are causing problems with water quality in the Gulf of Mexico?

95
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
First of all, we can take them to their own backyard.

96
0:06:04.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
If you want to go swimming in Wisconsin in the summer

97
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in your favorite watering hole,

98
0:06:11.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you might find something like this

99
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which looks like spilled green paint and smells like it,

100
0:06:18.96,000 --> 0:06:2,000
growing on the surface of the water.

101
0:06:21.52,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is a toxic blue-green algal bloom

102
0:06:25.4,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and it is not good for you.

103
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Similarly, in Lake Erie, couple of summers ago

104
0:06:33.64,000 --> 0:06:36,000
there was hundreds of miles of this blue-green algae

105
0:06:37.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and the city of Toledo, Ohio, couldn't use it for their drinking water

106
0:06:41.92,000 --> 0:06:42,000
for several days on end.

107
0:06:43.8,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And if you watch the news,

108
0:06:45.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you know that lots of communities are having trouble with drinking water.

109
0:06:53.44,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I'm a scientist.

110
0:06:55.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I don't know if you could tell that.

111
0:06:57.32,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

112
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I do solid science, I publish my results,

113
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
my colleagues read them, I get citations of my work.

114
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But I truly believe that, as a scientist,

115
0:07:15.68,000 --> 0:07:19,000
using mostly federal funds to do the research,

116
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I owe it to the public,

117
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to agency heads and congressional people

118
0:07:27.36,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to share my knowledge with them

119
0:07:29.96,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions

120
0:07:33.88,000 --> 0:07:35,000
about our environmental policy.

121
0:07:36.44,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Applause)

122
0:07:38.44,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Thank you.

123
0:07:39.72,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

124
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
One of the ways that I was able to do this is I brought in the media.

125
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And Joby Warrick from the "Washington Post"

126
0:07:52.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
put this picture in an article

127
0:07:55.36,000 --> 0:07:59,000
on the front page, Sunday morning, two inches above the fold.

128
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's a big deal.

129
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And Senator John Breaux, from Louisiana,

130
0:08:05.72,000 --> 0:08:09,000
said, "Oh my gosh, that's what they think the Gulf of Mexico looks like?"

131
0:08:09.96,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I said, "Well, you know, there's the proof."

132
0:08:12.64,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And we've go to do something about it.

133
0:08:15.36,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At the same time, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine

134
0:08:20.12,000 --> 0:08:23,000
was having trouble with harmful algal blooms in the Gulf of Maine.

135
0:08:24.04,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They joined forces -- it was bipartisan --

136
0:08:27.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:29.28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

138
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And invited me to give congressional testimony,

139
0:08:34.68,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and I said, "Oh, all I've done is chase crabs around south Texas,

140
0:08:37.76,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I don't know how to do that."

141
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

142
0:08:40.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But I did it.

143
0:08:41.68,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Cheers)

144
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And eventually, the bill passed.

145
0:08:44.799,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And it was called -- yeah, yay!

146
0:08:47.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It was called The Harmful Algal Bloom

147
0:08:50.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998.

148
0:08:55.36,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

149
0:08:56.84,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

150
0:09:00.2,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Thank you.

151
0:09:01.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Which is why we call it the Snowe-Breaux Bill.

152
0:09:03.96,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

153
0:09:06.4,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The other thing is that we had a conference in 2001

154
0:09:13.8,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that was put on by the National Academy of Sciences

155
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that looked at fertilizers, nitrogen and poor water quality.

156
0:09:21.88,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Our plenary speaker was the former governor

157
0:09:25.52,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of the state of New Jersey.

158
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And she ...

159
0:09:30.8,000 --> 0:09:34,000
There was no thinking she wasn't serious when she peered at the audience,

160
0:09:35.68,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I thought, "Surely she's looking at me."

161
0:09:38.84,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"You know, I'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey.

162
0:09:42.88,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Pick another state, any state, I just don't want to hear it anymore."

163
0:09:46.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But she was able to move the action plan

164
0:09:50.44,000 --> 0:09:55,000
across President George H.W. Bush's desk

165
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so that we had environmental goals

166
0:09:59.96,000 --> 0:10:,000
and that we were working to solve them.

167
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The Midwest does not feed the world.

168
0:10:07.88,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It feeds a lot of chickens, hogs, cattle

169
0:10:13.64,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and it generates ethanol

170
0:10:15.92,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to put into our gasoline,

171
0:10:18.32,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which is regulated by federal policy.

172
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We can do better than this.

173
0:10:25.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We need to make decisions

174
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that make us less consumptive

175
0:10:34.84,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and reduce our reliance on nitrogen.

176
0:10:39.92,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's like a carbon footprint.

177
0:10:42.12,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But you can reduce your nitrogen footprint.

178
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I do it by not eating much meat --

179
0:10:50.36,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I still like a little every now and then --

180
0:10:52.48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
not using corn oil,

181
0:10:55.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
driving a car that I can put nonethanol gas in

182
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:,000
and get better gas mileage.

183
0:11:02.52,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Just things like that that can make a difference.

184
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So I'm challenging, not just you,

185
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but I challenge a lot of people, especially in the Midwest --

186
0:11:12.2,000 --> 0:11:16,000
think about how you're treating your land and how you can make a difference.

187
0:11:18.04,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So my steps are very small steps.

188
0:11:22.32,000 --> 0:11:25,000
To change the type of agriculture in the US

189
0:11:26.04,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is going to be many big steps.

190
0:11:28.96,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And it's going to take political and social will for that to happen.

191
0:11:33.36,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But we can do it.

192
0:11:35.28,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I strongly believe we can translate the science,

193
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:43,000
bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment.

194
0:11:44.56,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We all want a clean environment.

195
0:11:47.04,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And we can work together to do this

196
0:11:49.64,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so that we no longer have these dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.

197
0:11:53.96,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Thank you.

198
0:11:55.2,000 --> 0:12:01,000

1
0:00:12.52,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm here to talk to you today

2
0:00:14.659,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe

3
0:00:17.795,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is not possible.

4
0:00:19.359,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's a story about a living, breathing start-up

5
0:00:21.681,000 --> 0:00:23,000
flourishing in an unlikely environment:

6
0:00:24.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the United States government.

7
0:00:25.95,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now, this start-up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt

8
0:00:28.608,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the way government does business from the inside out.

9
0:00:31.12,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But before I get there, let's start with the problem.

10
0:00:33.644,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For me, the problem begins with a number: 137.

11
0:00:37.923,000 --> 0:00:4,000
137 is the average number of days

12
0:00:41.441,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA.

13
0:00:44.876,000 --> 0:00:46,000
137 days.

14
0:00:47.032,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, in order to file that application in the first place,

15
0:00:49.811,000 --> 0:00:52,000
she has to navigate over 1,000 different websites

16
0:00:53.423,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and over 900 different call-in numbers,

17
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
all owned and operated by the United States government.

18
0:01:00.073,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, we live in times of incredible change.

19
0:01:03.266,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The private sector is constantly changing

20
0:01:05.74,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and improving itself all the time.

21
0:01:07.529,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For that matter, it's removing every single inconvenience in my life

22
0:01:10.991,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that I could possibly think of.

23
0:01:12.808,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I could be sitting on my couch in my apartment,

24
0:01:15.387,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and from my phone, I can order a warm, gluten-free meal

25
0:01:18.453,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that can arrive at my door in less than 10 minutes.

26
0:01:21.456,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But meanwhile, a working mother who depends on food stamps

27
0:01:25.703,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to support her family

28
0:01:27.788,000 --> 0:01:3,000
has to complete an arduous, complicated application

29
0:01:30.951,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which she might not even be able to do online.

30
0:01:33.436,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means

31
0:01:37.602,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that she might be having to take days or hours off of work

32
0:01:40.706,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that she can't spare.

33
0:01:43.173,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this growing dichotomy

34
0:01:45.713,000 --> 0:01:47,000
between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution

35
0:01:48.031,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and those it's left behind

36
0:01:49.45,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is one of the greatest challenges of our time --

37
0:01:51.996,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Applause)

38
0:01:57.607,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Because government's failure to deliver digital services that work

39
0:02:01.886,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most.

40
0:02:06.464,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's impacting the students trying to go to college,

41
0:02:09.107,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the single mothers trying to get health care,

42
0:02:11.185,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the veterans coming home from battle.

43
0:02:12.986,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They can't get what they need when they need it.

44
0:02:16.082,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And for these Americans,

45
0:02:17.492,000 --> 0:02:2,000
government is more than just a presidential election every four years.

46
0:02:21.171,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Government is a lifeline that provides services they need

47
0:02:24.261,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and depend on and deserve.

48
0:02:26.61,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Which is, quite frankly,

49
0:02:27.801,000 --> 0:02:3,000
why government needs to get its shit together and catch up.

50
0:02:31.008,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Just saying.

51
0:02:32.191,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Applause)

52
0:02:35.95,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about.

53
0:02:38.895,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008,

54
0:02:41.679,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we brought the tech industry's best practices into politics.

55
0:02:44.86,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We earned more money,

56
0:02:46.615,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we engaged more volunteers

57
0:02:48.36,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history.

58
0:02:52.058,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We were a cutting-edge start-up that changed the game of politics forever.

59
0:02:55.864,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So when the President asked a small group of us

60
0:02:58.147,000 --> 0:03:,000
to bring that very same disruption directly into government,

61
0:03:01.022,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,

62
0:03:02.913,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but I was eager and showed up ready to get to work.

63
0:03:06.791,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, on my first day in DC,

64
0:03:09.465,000 --> 0:03:11,000
my first day in government,

65
0:03:11.999,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I walked into the office and they handed me a laptop.

66
0:03:14.964,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And the laptop was running Windows 98.

67
0:03:17.448,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:18.846,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I mean, three entire presidential elections had come and gone

69
0:03:22.562,000 --> 0:03:25,000
since the government had updated the operating system on that computer.

70
0:03:25.943,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Three elections!

71
0:03:28.093,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Which is when we realized

72
0:03:29.662,000 --> 0:03:33,000
this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined.

73
0:03:33.75,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Let me paint the picture for you.

74
0:03:36.29,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The federal government is the largest institution in the world.

75
0:03:40.097,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It spends over 86 billion dollars a year -- 86 billion --

76
0:03:44.693,000 --> 0:03:45,000
on federal IT projects.

77
0:03:46.763,000 --> 0:03:47,000
For context:

78
0:03:47.938,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends

79
0:03:50.883,000 --> 0:03:51,000
annually -- on everything.

80
0:03:53.547,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, the problem here

81
0:03:55.413,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for,

82
0:03:59.548,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because 94 percent of federal IT projects

83
0:04:03.389,000 --> 0:04:05,000
are over budget or behind schedule.

84
0:04:05.628,000 --> 0:04:06,000
94 percent!

85
0:04:07.088,000 --> 0:04:08,000
For those of you keeping score,

86
0:04:08.601,000 --> 0:04:1,000
yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.

87
0:04:10.934,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:13.045,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There's another problem:

89
0:04:14.624,000 --> 0:04:17,000
40 percent of those never end up seeing the light of day.

90
0:04:18.412,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They are completely scrapped or abandoned.

91
0:04:21.014,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization,

92
0:04:25.796,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because it means as government continues to operate

93
0:04:28.217,000 --> 0:04:29,000
as it's programmed to do,

94
0:04:29.456,000 --> 0:04:3,000
failure is nearly inevitable.

95
0:04:31.482,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And when the status quo is the riskiest option,

96
0:04:34.97,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that means there is simply no other choice

97
0:04:37.042,000 --> 0:04:38,000
than radical disruption.

98
0:04:40.039,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So, what do we do about it?

99
0:04:42.733,000 --> 0:04:43,000
How do we fix this?

100
0:04:45.065,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Well, the irony of all of this

101
0:04:47.706,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard,

102
0:04:51.003,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because right here in America are the very ideas, the very people,

103
0:04:54.892,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who have swept our world into a radically different place

104
0:04:57.586,000 --> 0:04:58,000
than it was two decades ago.

105
0:04:59.276,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So what would it look like

106
0:05:01.581,000 --> 0:05:04,000
if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits

107
0:05:04.945,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as it is to order cat food to my house?

108
0:05:08.358,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What would it look like

109
0:05:10.628,000 --> 0:05:13,000
if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators

110
0:05:14.585,000 --> 0:05:15,000
who have disrupted our tech sector

111
0:05:16.372,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to come and disrupt their government?

112
0:05:18.989,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Well, my friends, here's where we get to talk

113
0:05:21.143,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered

114
0:05:23.814,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for creating change in government.

115
0:05:25.511,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Enter the United States Digital Service.

116
0:05:28.329,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The United States Digital Service is a new network of start-ups,

117
0:05:31.823,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a team of teams,

118
0:05:33.402,000 --> 0:05:36,000
organizing themselves across government to create radical change.

119
0:05:38.352,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government

120
0:05:41.699,000 --> 0:05:43,000
deliver world-class digital services

121
0:05:43.811,000 --> 0:05:47,000
for students, immigrants, children, the elderly -- everybody --

122
0:05:48.364,000 --> 0:05:5,000
at dramatically lower costs.

123
0:05:51.664,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We are essentially trying to build a more awesome government,

124
0:05:55.163,000 --> 0:05:57,000
for the people, by the people, today.

125
0:05:57.288,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We don't care -- (Applause) Thank you.

126
0:05:59.162,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

127
0:06:01.378,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Who doesn't want a more awesome government, right?

128
0:06:04.632,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We don't care about politics.

129
0:06:07.154,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We care about making government work better,

130
0:06:09.368,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because it's the only one we've got.

131
0:06:11.454,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:13.883,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, you can think of our team -- well, it's pretty funny --

133
0:06:17.13,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you can think of our team a little bit like

134
0:06:19.206,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6.

135
0:06:22.316,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,

136
0:06:24.103,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but instead of traveling to crazy, interesting, far-off places,

137
0:06:27.1,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers,

138
0:06:29.513,000 --> 0:06:31,000
helping restore the fabric of our democracy.

139
0:06:31.782,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:33.859,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, this team -- our playbook for the United States Digital Service

141
0:06:38.197,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is pretty simple.

142
0:06:40.053,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The first play is we recruit the very best talent

143
0:06:43.681,000 --> 0:06:44,000
our country has to offer,

144
0:06:45.418,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government.

145
0:06:48.447,000 --> 0:06:51,000
These are the very people who have helped build the products and companies

146
0:06:51.973,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world.

147
0:06:55.38,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Second, we pair these incredible people from the tech core

148
0:06:58.573,000 --> 0:07:,000
with the dedicated civil servants already inside government

149
0:07:01.463,000 --> 0:07:03,000
on the ground creating change.

150
0:07:03.605,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Third, we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation

151
0:07:07.515,000 --> 0:07:1,000
at the most mission-critical, life-changing, important services

152
0:07:10.699,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that government offers.

153
0:07:12.23,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And finally, we give them massive air cover,

154
0:07:14.897,000 --> 0:07:15,000
from the leadership inside the agencies

155
0:07:16.796,000 --> 0:07:18,000
all the way up to the President himself,

156
0:07:19.186,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to transform these services for the better.

157
0:07:22.437,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now, this team is beginning to disrupt

158
0:07:25.276,000 --> 0:07:27,000
how government does business from the inside out.

159
0:07:28.538,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If you study classic patterns of disruption,

160
0:07:31.569,000 --> 0:07:33,000
one very common pattern is rather simple.

161
0:07:34.252,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry

162
0:07:37.879,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and apply it to another where it's a radical departure

163
0:07:40.443,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from the status quo.

164
0:07:41.736,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Think about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality

165
0:07:45.076,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and revolutionized my apartment.

166
0:07:48.058,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The United States Digital Service is doing exactly that.

167
0:07:50.948,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned

168
0:07:54.266,000 --> 0:07:55,000
through a ton of hard work

169
0:07:55.592,000 --> 0:07:57,000
about how to build planetary-scale digital services

170
0:07:58.227,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that delight users at lower cost,

171
0:08:00.115,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and we're applying that to government,

172
0:08:01.979,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where it is a radical departure from the status quo.

173
0:08:04.899,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, the good news is:

174
0:08:07.416,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's starting to work.

175
0:08:09.768,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We know this because we can already see the results

176
0:08:12.222,000 --> 0:08:15,000
from some of our early projects, like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,

177
0:08:15.883,000 --> 0:08:16,000
when that went off the rails.

178
0:08:17.497,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play,

179
0:08:21.225,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and today we are taking that same play

180
0:08:23.106,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and scaling it across a large number

181
0:08:24.876,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of government's most important citizen-facing services.

182
0:08:29.077,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now, if I can take a moment

183
0:08:31.348,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and brag about the team for a second --

184
0:08:33.475,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it is the highest concentration of badasses

185
0:08:36.086,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I could have ever dreamed of.

186
0:08:38.314,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We have top talent from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,

187
0:08:42.166,000 --> 0:08:44,000
all on staff today,

188
0:08:44.351,000 --> 0:08:47,000
all choosing to join their government.

189
0:08:47.699,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And what's incredible is,

190
0:08:48.963,000 --> 0:08:51,000
everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent.

191
0:08:52.922,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And I might add, by the way, over half of us are women.

192
0:08:56.406,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Applause)

193
0:09:03.244,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The best way to understand this strategy

194
0:09:05.607,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is actually to walk through a couple of examples

195
0:09:07.891,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of how it's working out in the wild.

196
0:09:09.645,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I'm going to give you two examples quickly.

197
0:09:11.681,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The first one is about immigration.

198
0:09:13.986,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This, my friends, is your typical immigration application.

199
0:09:17.625,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Yes, you guessed it --

200
0:09:18.812,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it's almost entirely paper-based.

201
0:09:21.31,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In the best case,

202
0:09:22.485,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the application takes about six to eight months to process.

203
0:09:25.317,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It is physically shipped thousands of miles -- thousands of miles! --

204
0:09:29.174,000 --> 0:09:31,000
between no less than six processing centers.

205
0:09:32.188,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, little story:

206
0:09:34.168,000 --> 0:09:35,000
about a decade ago,

207
0:09:35.343,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the government thought that if it brought this system online,

208
0:09:38.244,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service,

209
0:09:41.142,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which was a great idea.

210
0:09:42.317,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So, the typical government process began.

211
0:09:45.922,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,

212
0:09:50.287,000 --> 0:09:52,000
no working product was delivered --

213
0:09:52.592,000 --> 0:09:54,000
1.2 billion with a "B."

214
0:09:55.48,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now at this point, the agency responsible,

215
0:09:58.046,000 --> 0:09:59,000
US Citizenship and Immigration Services,

216
0:09:59.993,000 --> 0:10:01,000
could have kept pouring money into the failing program.

217
0:10:02.781,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Sadly, that's what often happens.

218
0:10:04.448,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That's the status quo today.

219
0:10:06.075,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But they didn't.

220
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The dedicated civil servants inside the agency

221
0:10:09.502,000 --> 0:10:11,000
decided to stand up and call for change.

222
0:10:11.825,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We deployed a small team of just six people,

223
0:10:14.497,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and what many people don't know is

224
0:10:16.203,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov --

225
0:10:19.158,000 --> 0:10:2,000
just six people.

226
0:10:20.403,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And that team jumped in, side-by-side,

227
0:10:22.258,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to support the agency in transitioning this project

228
0:10:24.996,000 --> 0:10:27,000
into more modern business practices, more modern development practices.

229
0:10:29.216,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now, in non-tech speak,

230
0:10:30.405,000 --> 0:10:33,000
what that basically means is taking big, multi-year projects

231
0:10:34.411,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks,

232
0:10:36.75,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so that way we can reduce the risk

233
0:10:38.41,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and actually start to see results every couple of weeks,

234
0:10:41.071,000 --> 0:10:43,000
instead of waiting in a black box for years.

235
0:10:43.256,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So within less than three months of our team being on the ground,

236
0:10:46.486,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we were already able to push our first products to production.

237
0:10:50.152,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The first one, this is the form I-90.

238
0:10:52.788,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This is used to file for your replacement green card.

239
0:10:56.208,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, for immigrant visa holders,

240
0:10:57.797,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a replacement green card is a big deal.

241
0:11:00.709,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Your green card is your proof of identification,

242
0:11:02.991,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it's your work authorization,

243
0:11:04.404,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it's the proof that you can be here in this country.

244
0:11:06.877,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So waiting six months while the government processes the replacement

245
0:11:10.122,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is not cool.

246
0:11:11.346,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'm excited to tell you that today,

247
0:11:13.061,000 --> 0:11:16,000
you can now, for the first time, file for a replacement green card

248
0:11:16.242,000 --> 0:11:19,000
entirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper.

249
0:11:19.469,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It is faster, it is cheaper,

250
0:11:21.511,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and it's a better user experience for the applicant

251
0:11:23.932,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the government employees alike.

252
0:11:25.844,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

253
0:11:32.677,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Another one, quickly.

254
0:11:33.852,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Last fall, we just released a brand-new practice civics test.

255
0:11:37.123,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So as part of becoming a US citizen,

256
0:11:39.387,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you have to pass a civics test.

257
0:11:41.761,000 --> 0:11:45,000
For anyone who has taken this test, it can be quite the stressful process.

258
0:11:46.123,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So our team released a very easy, simple-to-use tool in plain language

259
0:11:50.734,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to help people prepare,

260
0:11:52.914,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to help ease their nerves,

261
0:11:54.612,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to help them feel more confident

262
0:11:56.366,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in taking the next step in pursuing their American dream.

263
0:11:59.821,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Because all of this work, all of this work on immigration,

264
0:12:02.756,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is about taking complicated processes and making them more human.

265
0:12:07.527,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The other day, one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground

266
0:12:10.581,000 --> 0:12:12,000
said something incredibly profound.

267
0:12:13.483,000 --> 0:12:16,000
She said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic

268
0:12:16.73,000 --> 0:12:18,000
about a project in her entire time in government.

269
0:12:20.101,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And she's been doing this for 30 years.

270
0:12:23.285,000 --> 0:12:25,000
That is exactly the kind of hope and culture change

271
0:12:25.73,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we are trying to create.

272
0:12:27.435,000 --> 0:12:3,000
For my second example, I want to bring it back to veterans for a second,

273
0:12:30.943,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and what we are doing to build them a VA

274
0:12:32.917,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice.

275
0:12:36.129,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I'm proud to say that just a few months ago,

276
0:12:38.321,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we released a brand-new beta

277
0:12:40.241,000 --> 0:12:42,000
of a new website, Vets.gov.

278
0:12:42.92,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website

279
0:12:44.929,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place.

280
0:12:48.689,000 --> 0:12:5,000
One website, not thousands.

281
0:12:52.166,000 --> 0:12:54,000
The site is a work in progress, but it's significant progress,

282
0:12:55.189,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because it's designed with the users who matter most:

283
0:12:57.8,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the veterans themselves.

284
0:12:59.729,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This might sound incredibly obvious, because it should be,

285
0:13:02.546,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but sadly, this isn't normal for government.

286
0:13:04.792,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Far too often, product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders

287
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
who do their best to represent the interests of the user,

288
0:13:10.966,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but they're not necessarily the users themselves.

289
0:13:13.294,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data,

290
0:13:15.859,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we talked to veterans themselves

291
0:13:17.547,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we started simple and small,

292
0:13:19.159,000 --> 0:13:22,000
with the two most important services that matter most to them:

293
0:13:22.567,000 --> 0:13:24,000
education benefits and disability benefits.

294
0:13:25.873,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I'm proud to say that they are live on the site today,

295
0:13:28.541,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and as the team continues to streamline more services,

296
0:13:31.103,000 --> 0:13:33,000
they will be ported over here, and the old sites, shut down.

297
0:13:33.978,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Applause)

298
0:13:39.596,000 --> 0:13:43,000
To me, this is what change looks like in 2016.

299
0:13:44.493,000 --> 0:13:45,000
When you walk out of the Oval Office,

300
0:13:46.291,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the first time I was ever there, I noticed a quote

301
0:13:48.656,000 --> 0:13:49,000
the President had embroidered on the rug.

302
0:13:50.647,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's the classic JFK quote.

303
0:13:52.576,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It says, "No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings."

304
0:13:57.882,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's true.

305
0:13:59.256,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We have the tools to solve these problems.

306
0:14:02.423,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We have the tools to come together as a society, as a country,

307
0:14:05.732,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and to fix this together.

308
0:14:08.073,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Yes, it's hard.

309
0:14:10.034,000 --> 0:14:12,000
It's particularly hard when we have to fight,

310
0:14:12.161,000 --> 0:14:16,000
when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change.

311
0:14:16.626,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But in my experience,

312
0:14:18.38,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing,

313
0:14:21.864,000 --> 0:14:22,000
because if we don't do them,

314
0:14:23.693,000 --> 0:14:24,000
who will?

315
0:14:25.13,000 --> 0:14:27,000
This is on us,

316
0:14:27.162,000 --> 0:14:28,000
all of us, together,

317
0:14:29.082,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because government is not an abstract institution or a concept.

318
0:14:32.686,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Our government is us.

319
0:14:35.79,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

320
0:14:40.541,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Today, it is no longer a question

321
0:14:42.614,000 --> 0:14:43,000
of if change is possible.

322
0:14:45.422,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The question is not, "Can we?"

323
0:14:48.367,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The question is, "Will we?"

324
0:14:50.912,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Will you?

325
0:14:52.316,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Thank you.

326
0:14:53.508,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

327
0:14:57.12,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Thank you.

328
0:14:58.334,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.458,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For the past 15 years I've been trying to change your mind.

2
0:00:17.917,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In my work I harness pop culture and emerging technology

3
0:00:21.792,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to shift cultural norms.

4
0:00:23.833,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've made video games to promote human rights,

5
0:00:27.542,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've made animations to raise awareness about unfair immigration laws

6
0:00:32.625,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I've even made location-based augmented reality apps

7
0:00:36.875,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to change perceptions around homelessness

8
0:00:39.542,000 --> 0:00:4,000
well before Pokémon Go.

9
0:00:41.5,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:42.875,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But then I began to wonder whether a game or an app

11
0:00:46.917,000 --> 0:00:48,000
can really change attitudes and behaviors,

12
0:00:49.417,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and if so, can I measure that change?

13
0:00:52.458,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What's the science behind that process?

14
0:00:55.458,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So I shifted my focus from making media and technology

15
0:00:59.208,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to measuring their neurobiological effects.

16
0:01:03.458,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Here's what I discovered.

17
0:01:05.333,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The web, mobile devices, virtual and augmented reality

18
0:01:09.25,000 --> 0:01:11,000
were rescripting our nervous systems.

19
0:01:11.958,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And they were literally changing the structure of our brain.

20
0:01:15.875,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The very technologies I had been using to positively influence hearts and minds

21
0:01:20.875,000 --> 0:01:24,000
were actually eroding functions in the brain necessary for empathy

22
0:01:25.292,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and decision-making.

23
0:01:27.167,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In fact, our dependence upon the web and mobile devices

24
0:01:31.333,000 --> 0:01:35,000
might be taking over our cognitive and affective faculties,

25
0:01:35.458,000 --> 0:01:38,000
rendering us socially and emotionally incompetent,

26
0:01:39.042,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I felt complicit in this dehumanization.

27
0:01:43.292,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I realized that before I could continue making media about social issues,

28
0:01:47.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I needed to reverse engineer the harmful effects of technology.

29
0:01:52.917,000 --> 0:01:54,000
To tackle this I asked myself,

30
0:01:55.708,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"How can I translate the mechanisms of empathy,

31
0:01:59.125,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the cognitive, affective and motivational aspects,

32
0:02:02.792,000 --> 0:02:05,000
into an engine that simulates the narrative ingredients

33
0:02:06.042,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that move us to act?"

34
0:02:08.583,000 --> 0:02:11,000
To answer this, I had to build a machine.

35
0:02:12.542,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:14.292,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I've been developing an open-source biometric lab,

37
0:02:17.208,000 --> 0:02:2,000
an AI system which I call the Limbic Lab.

38
0:02:20.708,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The lab not only captures

39
0:02:22.167,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the brain and body's unconscious response to media and technology

40
0:02:26.417,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but also uses machine learning to adapt content

41
0:02:29.417,000 --> 0:02:31,000
based on these biological responses.

42
0:02:32.667,000 --> 0:02:35,000
My goal is to find out what combination of narrative ingredients

43
0:02:36.208,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are the most appealing and galvanizing

44
0:02:38.375,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to specific target audiences

45
0:02:40.208,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to enable social justice, cultural and educational organizations

46
0:02:45.25,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to create more effective media.

47
0:02:47.917,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The Limbic Lab consists of two components:

48
0:02:50.792,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a narrative engine and a media machine.

49
0:02:54.375,000 --> 0:02:58,000
While a subject is viewing or interacting with media content,

50
0:02:58.625,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the narrative engine takes in and syncs real-time data from brain waves,

51
0:03:02.833,000 --> 0:03:05,000
biophysical data like heart rate, blood flow, body temperature

52
0:03:06.417,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and muscle contraction,

53
0:03:08.125,000 --> 0:03:1,000
as well as eye-tracking and facial expressions.

54
0:03:12.083,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Data is captured at key places where critical plot points,

55
0:03:15.833,000 --> 0:03:18,000
character interaction or unusual camera angles occur.

56
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Like the final scene in "Game of Thrones, Red Wedding,"

57
0:03:23.042,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when shockingly,

58
0:03:25.375,000 --> 0:03:26,000
everybody dies.

59
0:03:26.958,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:29.042,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Survey data on that person's political beliefs,

61
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:35,000
along with their psychographic and demographic data,

62
0:03:35.417,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are integrated into the system

63
0:03:37.208,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to gain a deeper understanding of the individual.

64
0:03:40.833,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Let me give you an example.

65
0:03:43.708,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Matching people's TV preferences with their views on social justice issues

66
0:03:48.583,000 --> 0:03:52,000
reveals that Americans who rank immigration among their top three concerns

67
0:03:52.875,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are more likely to be fans of "The Walking Dead,"

68
0:03:56.958,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and they often watch for the adrenaline boost,

69
0:03:59.792,000 --> 0:04:,000
which is measurable.

70
0:04:01.792,000 --> 0:04:04,000
A person's biological signature and their survey response

71
0:04:05.75,000 --> 0:04:09,000
combines into a database to create their unique media imprint.

72
0:04:10.625,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Then our predictive model finds patterns between media imprints

73
0:04:14.917,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and tells me which narrative ingredients

74
0:04:16.917,000 --> 0:04:19,000
are more likely to lead to engagement in altruistic behavior

75
0:04:20.708,000 --> 0:04:22,000
rather than distress and apathy.

76
0:04:23.417,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The more imprints added to the database

77
0:04:25.625,000 --> 0:04:28,000
across mediums from episodic television to games,

78
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the better the predictive models become.

79
0:04:32.417,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In short, I am mapping the first media genome.

80
0:04:36.292,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Applause and cheers)

81
0:04:44.083,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Whereas the human genome identifies all genes involved

82
0:04:47.292,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in sequencing human DNA,

83
0:04:49.917,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the growing database of media imprints will eventually allow me

84
0:04:53.167,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to determine the media DNA for a specific person.

85
0:04:58.25,000 --> 0:05:,000
Already the Limbic Lab's narrative engine

86
0:05:02.333,000 --> 0:05:04,000
helps content creators refine their storytelling,

87
0:05:04.958,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so that it resonates with their target audiences on an individual level.

88
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The Limbic Lab's other component,

89
0:05:13.25,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the media machine,

90
0:05:15.25,000 --> 0:05:19,000
will assess how media elicits an emotional and physiological response,

91
0:05:19.75,000 --> 0:05:21,000
then pulls scenes from a content library

92
0:05:22.208,000 --> 0:05:24,000
targeted to person-specific media DNA.

93
0:05:26.042,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Applying artificial intelligence to biometric data

94
0:05:29.958,000 --> 0:05:31,000
creates a truly personalized experience.

95
0:05:32.708,000 --> 0:05:37,000
One that adapts content based on real-time unconscious responses.

96
0:05:38.625,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Imagine if nonprofits and media makers were able to measure how audiences feel

97
0:05:44.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as they experience it

98
0:05:46.583,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and alter content on the fly.

99
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I believe this is the future of media.

100
0:05:53.333,000 --> 0:05:55,000
To date, most media and social-change strategies

101
0:05:55.958,000 --> 0:05:57,000
have attempted to appeal to mass audiences,

102
0:05:58.833,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but the future is media customized for each person.

103
0:06:03.458,000 --> 0:06:05,000
As real-time measurement of media consumption

104
0:06:06.167,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and automated media production becomes the norm,

105
0:06:09.042,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we will soon be consuming media tailored directly to our cravings

106
0:06:13.125,000 --> 0:06:17,000
using a blend of psychographics, biometrics and AI.

107
0:06:18.25,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's like personalized medicine based on our DNA.

108
0:06:21.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I call it "biomedia."

109
0:06:25.042,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I am currently testing the Limbic Lab in a pilot study

110
0:06:28.333,000 --> 0:06:3,000
with the Norman Lear Center,

111
0:06:30.375,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which looks at the top 50 episodic television shows.

112
0:06:34.125,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But I am grappling with an ethical dilemma.

113
0:06:37.167,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If I design a tool that can be turned into a weapon,

114
0:06:41.042,000 --> 0:06:42,000
should I build it?

115
0:06:43.75,000 --> 0:06:46,000
By open-sourcing the lab to encourage access and inclusivity,

116
0:06:47.417,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I also run the risk of enabling powerful governments

117
0:06:50.875,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and profit-driven companies to appropriate the platform

118
0:06:53.833,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for fake news, marketing or other forms of mass persuasion.

119
0:06:59.375,000 --> 0:07:02,000
For me, therefore, it is critical to make my research

120
0:07:02.75,000 --> 0:07:05,000
as transparent to lay audiences as GMO labels.

121
0:07:07.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
However, this is not enough.

122
0:07:11.208,000 --> 0:07:12,000
As creative technologists,

123
0:07:12.875,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we have a responsibility

124
0:07:15.125,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not only to reflect upon how present technology shapes our cultural values

125
0:07:19.917,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and social behavior,

126
0:07:21.958,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but also to actively challenge the trajectory of future technology.

127
0:07:26.917,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It is my hope that we make an ethical commitment

128
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to harvesting the body's intelligence

129
0:07:33.375,000 --> 0:07:36,000
for the creation of authentic and just stories

130
0:07:36.833,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that transform media and technology

131
0:07:39.25,000 --> 0:07:42,000
from harmful weapons into narrative medicine.

132
0:07:42.75,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Thank you.

133
0:07:44.042,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause and cheers)

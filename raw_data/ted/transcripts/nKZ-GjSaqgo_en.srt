1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about the human genome and what that might mean,

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and discovering new sets of genes.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We're actually starting at a new point:

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we've been digitizing biology,

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and now we're trying to go from that digital code

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
into a new phase of biology

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with designing and synthesizing life.

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
have been trying to understand

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at various levels.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We've tried various approaches,

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
paring it down to minimal components.

15
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when we sequenced the human genome,

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it was going from the analog world of biology

18
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
into the digital world of the computer.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or can we create new life

21
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
out of this digital universe?"

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is the map of a small organism,

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Mycoplasma genitalium,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that has the smallest genome for a species

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that can self-replicate in the laboratory,

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we've been trying to just see if

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we can come up with an even smaller genome.

28
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes

29
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
out of the 500 or so that are here.

30
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When we look at its metabolic map,

31
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's relatively simple

32
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
compared to ours --

33
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
trust me, this is simple --

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but when we look at all the genes

35
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that we can knock out one at a time,

36
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's very unlikely that this would yield

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
a living cell.

38
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we decided the only way forward

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was to actually synthesize this chromosome

40
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so we could vary the components

41
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to ask some of these most fundamental questions.

42
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And so we started down the road of:

43
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
can we synthesize a chromosome?

44
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Can chemistry permit making

45
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
these really large molecules

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where we've never been before?

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?

48
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.

49
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing

50
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
at an exponential pace.

51
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Our ability to write the genetic code

52
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
has been moving pretty slowly

53
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but has been increasing,

54
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.

55
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We started this over 15 years ago.

56
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It took several stages, in fact,

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.

58
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But it turns out synthesizing DNA

59
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is very difficult.

60
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that make small pieces of DNA --

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
30 to 50 letters in length --

63
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,

64
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the more errors there are.

65
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So we had to create a new method

66
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

67
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information

68
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of the genome of phi X174.

69
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.

70
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We designed the pieces, went through our error correction

71
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and had a DNA molecule

72
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of about 5,000 letters.

73
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical

74
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and put it in the bacteria,

75
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,

76
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
made the viral particles.

77
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The viral particles then were released from the cells

78
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and came back and killed the E. coli.

79
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was talking to the oil industry recently

80
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I said they clearly understood that model.

81
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)

83
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And so, we think this is a situation

84
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where the software can actually build its own hardware

85
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in a biological system.

86
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But we wanted to go much larger:

87
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --

88
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --

89
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses

90
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so we could actually vary the cassettes

91
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to understand

92
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
what the actual components of a living cell are.

93
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Design is critical,

94
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,

95
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that digital information has to be really accurate.

96
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

97
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.

98
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We actually found, on resequencing it,

99
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
30 errors; had we used that original sequence,

100
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
it never would have been able to be booted up.

101
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Part of the design is designing pieces

102
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that are 50 letters long

103
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces

104
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to build smaller subunits

105
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we have to design so they can go together.

106
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We design unique elements into this.

107
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You may have read that we put watermarks in.

108
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Think of this:

109
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.

110
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Triplets of those letters

111
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
code for roughly 20 amino acids,

112
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
such that there's a single letter designation

113
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for each of the amino acids.

114
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So we can use the genetic code to write out words,

115
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
sentences, thoughts.

116
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Initially, all we did was autograph it.

117
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.

118
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We designed these pieces so

119
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we can just chew back with enzymes;

120
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.

121
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we started making pieces,

122
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,

123
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,

124
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

125
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance

126
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so we could sequence them

127
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust

128
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that you can see in a minute.

129
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We're trying to get to the point of automation.

130
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So, this looks like a basketball playoff.

131
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
When we get into these really large pieces

132
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
over 100,000 base pairs,

133
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --

134
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --

135
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and so we turned to other mechanisms.

136
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination

137
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that biology uses to repair DNA

138
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that can put pieces together.

139
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Here's an example of it:

140
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
there's an organism called

141
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Deinococcus radiodurans

142
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that can take three millions rads of radiation.

143
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.

144
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it

145
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
back together exactly as it was before.

146
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.

147
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
These organisms can be totally desiccated;

148
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
they can live in a vacuum.

149
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,

150
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
move around, find a new aqueous environment.

151
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

152
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built

153
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms

154
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with the right design of the pieces we put them in;

155
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
yeast puts them together automatically.

156
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is not an electron micrograph;

157
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
this is just a regular photomicrograph.

158
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's such a large molecule

159
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we can see it with a light microscope.

160
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
These are pictures over about a six-second period.

161
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.

162
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;

163
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.

164
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's over 300 million molecular weight.

165
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,

166
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
it takes 142 pages

167
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
just to print this genetic code.

168
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?

169
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;

170
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.

171
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's also simpler when you go

172
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
into eukaryotes like ourselves:

173
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you can just pop out the nucleus

174
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and pop in another one,

175
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.

176
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,

177
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant

178
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of a chromosome from one cell to another

179
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and activate it.

180
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --

181
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --

182
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we added a few extra genes

183
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so we could select for this chromosome,

184
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we digested it with enzymes

185
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to kill all the proteins,

186
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --

187
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and you'll appreciate

188
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
our very sophisticated graphics here.

189
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The new chromosome went into the cell.

190
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,

191
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

192
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

193
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We find all kinds of species

194
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that have taken up a second chromosome

195
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or a third one from somewhere,

196
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
adding thousands of new traits

197
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in a second to that species.

198
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So, people who think of evolution

199
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as just one gene changing at a time

200
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
have missed much of biology.

201
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes

202
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that actually digest DNA.

203
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The chromosome that was in the cell

204
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
doesn't have one;

205
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the chromosome we put in does.

206
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It got expressed and it recognized

207
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the other chromosome as foreign material,

208
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
chewed it up, and so we ended up

209
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
just with a cell with the new chromosome.

210
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.

211
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And with a very short period of time,

212
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
all the characteristics of one species were lost

213
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and it converted totally into the new species

214
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
based on the new software that we put in the cell.

215
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
All the proteins changed,

216
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the membranes changed;

217
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.

218
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,

219
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,

220
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
change things quite dramatically.

221
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now I've argued, this is not genesis;

222
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.

223
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps

224
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,

225
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
where there's massive new speciation

226
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
based on this digital design.

227
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Why do this?

228
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.

229
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We're about to go from six and a half

230
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to nine billion people over the next 40 years.

231
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
To put it in context for myself:

232
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
I was born in 1946.

233
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There are now three people on the planet

234
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
for every one of us that existed in 1946;

235
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
within 40 years, there'll be four.

236
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,

237
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
medicines, fuel

238
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for the six and a half billion.

239
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.

240
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We use over five billion tons of coal,

241
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
30 billion-plus barrels of oil --

242
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that's a hundred million barrels a day.

243
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
When we try to think of biological processes

244
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or any process to replace that,

245
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
it's going to be a huge challenge.

246
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Then of course, there's all that

247
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
CO2 from this material

248
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that ends up in the atmosphere.

249
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We now, from our discovery around the world,

250
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
have a database with about 20 million genes,

251
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.

252
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,

253
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and look at the diversity that came out of that.

254
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We're limited here primarily

255
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by a biological reality

256
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and our imagination.

257
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We now have techniques,

258
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because of these rapid methods of synthesis,

259
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.

260
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We have the ability now to build a large robot

261
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that can make a million chromosomes a day.

262
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes

263
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or trying to optimize processes

264
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,

265
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
new vaccines,

266
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we can just with a small team,

267
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
do more molecular biology

268
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
than the last 20 years of all science.

269
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And it's just standard selection:

270
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
we can select for viability,

271
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
chemical or fuel production,

272
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
vaccine production, etc.

273
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is a screen snapshot

274
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of some true design software

275
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that we're working on to actually be able to sit down

276
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and design species in the computer.

277
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:

278
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.

279
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.

280
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You've seen recently, corn to ethanol

281
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is just a bad experiment.

282
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We have second- and third-generation fuels

283
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that will be coming out relatively soon

284
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels

285
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
like octane or different types of butanol.

286
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But the only way we think that biology

287
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
can have a major impact without

288
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability

289
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,

290
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.

291
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels

292
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in about 18 months.

293
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...

294
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

295
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but in our discovery around the world,

296
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
we have all kinds of other methods.

297
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This is an organism we described in 1996.

298
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It lives in the deep ocean,

299
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
about a mile and a half deep,

300
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
almost at boiling-water temperatures.

301
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It takes CO2 to methane

302
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

303
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We're looking to see if we can take

304
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
captured CO2,

305
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
which can easily be piped to sites,

306
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
convert that CO2 back into fuel

307
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to drive this process.

308
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So, in a short period of time,

309
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we think that we might be able to increase

310
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
what the basic question is of "What is life?"

311
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We truly, you know,

312
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
have modest goals

313
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry --

314
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

315
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? --

316
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

317
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
become a major source of energy ...

318
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
But also, we're now working on using these same tools

319
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to come up with instant sets of vaccines.

320
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
You've seen this year with flu;

321
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we're always a year behind and a dollar short

322
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
when it comes to the right vaccine.

323
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I think that can be changed

324
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.

325
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Here's what the future may begin to look like

326
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,

327
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
speeding up evolution

328
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
with synthetic bacteria, Archaea

329
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and, eventually, eukaryotes.

330
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We're a ways away from improving people:

331
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance

332
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

333
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000

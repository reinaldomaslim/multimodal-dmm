1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a real pleasure to be here.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I last did a TED Talk

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I think about seven years ago or so.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I talked about spaghetti sauce.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And so many people, I guess, watch those videos.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
People have been coming up to me ever since

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is a wonderful thing in the short term --

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but it's proven to be less than ideal

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
over seven years.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so I though I would come

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The theme of this morning's session is Things We Make.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And so I thought I would tell a story

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
about someone

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
who made one of the most precious objects

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of his era.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And the man's name is Carl Norden.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Carl Norden was born in 1880.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And he was Swiss.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And of course, the Swiss can be divided

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
into two general categories:

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
those who make small, exquisite,

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
expensive objects

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and those who handle the money

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of those who buy small, exquisite,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
expensive objects.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He's an engineer.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In fact, one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
who would go on

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to break small, expensive, exquisite objects.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
He wears three-piece suits;

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and he has a very, very small, important mustache;

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and he is domineering

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and narcissistic

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and driven

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and has an extraordinary ego;

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and he works 16-hour days;

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and he has very strong feelings about alternating current;

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness;

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and he drinks lots of coffee;

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and he does his best work

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in complete silence

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with nothing but a slide rule.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In any case,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Carl Norden emigrates to the United States

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
just before the First World War

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and sets up shop on Lafayette Street

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in downtown Manhattan.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And he becomes obsessed with the question

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of how to drop bombs from an airplane.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now if you think about it,

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in the age before GPS and radar,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that was obviously a really difficult problem.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's a complicated physics problem.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air,

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
going at hundreds of miles an hour,

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and you're trying to drop an object, a bomb,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
towards some stationary target

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and all kinds of other impediments.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And all sorts of people,

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
moving up to the First World War and between the wars,

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
tried to solve this problem,

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and nearly everybody came up short.

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The bombsights that were available

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
were incredibly crude.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It weighs about 50 lbs.

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and gadgets and gauges.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And he makes this complicated thing.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And what he allows people to do

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is he makes the bombardier take this particular object,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
visually sight the target,

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber,

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and then they plug in the altitude of the plane,

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the speed of the plane, the speed of the wind

89
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the coordinates

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of the target.

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb.

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And as Norden famously says,

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Before that bombsight came along,

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
bombs would routinely miss their target

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by a mile or more."

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But he said, with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight,

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
at 20,000 ft.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now I cannot tell you

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
how incredibly excited

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the U.S. military was

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
by the news of the Norden bombsight.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It was like manna from heaven.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Here was an army

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that had just had experience in the First World War,

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
where millions of men

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
fought each other in the trenches,

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
getting nowhere, making no progress,

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and here someone had come up with a device

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that allowed them to fly up in the skies

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
high above enemy territory

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and destroy whatever they wanted

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with pinpoint accuracy.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the U.S. military

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
spends 1.5 billion dollars --

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
billion dollars in 1940 dollars --

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
developing the Norden bombsight.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And to put that in perspective,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the total cost of the Manhattan project

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
was three billion dollars.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of the modern era.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And there were people, strategists, within the U.S. military

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
who genuinely thought that this single device

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was going to spell the difference

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
between defeat and victory

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
when it came to the battle against the Nazis

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and against the Japanese.

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And for Norden as well,

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this device had incredible moral importance,

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because Norden was a committed Christian.

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In fact, he would always get upset

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when people referred to the bombsight as his invention,

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because in his eyes,

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
only God could invent things.

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
He was simply the instrument of God's will.

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And what was God's will?

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
be reduced to as small an amount as possible.

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And what did the Norden bombsight do?

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well it allowed you to do that.

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It allowed you to bomb only those things

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb.

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So in the years leading up to the Second World War,

146
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the U.S. military buys 90,000

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of these Norden bombsights

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
at a cost of $14,000 each --

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
again, in 1940 dollars, that's a lot of money.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them --

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
long extensive, months-long training sessions --

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because these things are essentially analog computers;

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they're not easy to use.

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath,

155
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to swear that if they're ever captured,

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
they will not divulge a single detail

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of this particular device to the enemy,

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
on this absolutely essential piece of technology.

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane,

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it's escorted there by a series of armed guards.

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards.

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's never allowed to be photographed.

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And there's a little incendiary device inside of it,

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.

168
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The Norden bombsight

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is the Holy Grail.

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So what happens during the Second World War?

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Well, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In practice, the Norden bombsight

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but that's under perfect conditions.

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And of course, in wartime,

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
conditions aren't perfect.

177
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
First of all, it's really hard to use -- really hard to use.

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And not all of the people

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
have the ability to properly program an analog computer.

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and gadgets and ball-bearings,

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and they don't work as well as they ought to

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in the heat of battle.

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Thirdly, when Norden was making his calculations,

187
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
he assumed that a plane would be flying

188
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes.

189
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Well in a real war, you can't do that;

190
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
you'll get shot down.

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.

192
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
under those conditions.

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But most of all,

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the Norden bombsight required the bombardier

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to make visual contact with the target.

197
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But of course, what happens in real life?

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There are clouds, right.

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate.

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Well how many cloudless skies

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
do you think there were above Central Europe

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
between 1940 and 1945?

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Not a lot.

204
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And then to give you a sense

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was,

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
there was a famous case in 1944

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.

208
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And the chemical plant comprised

209
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
757 acres.

210
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And over the course of 22 bombing missions,

211
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs

212
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
on this 757 acre chemical plant,

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
using the Norden bombsight.

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Well what percentage of those bombs

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
do you think actually landed

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant?

217
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
10 percent. 10 percent.

218
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And of those 10 percent that landed,

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
16 percent didn't even go off; they were duds.

220
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The Leuna chemical plant,

221
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war,

222
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
was up and running within weeks.

223
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And by the way, all those precautions

224
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis?

225
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Well it turns out

226
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,

227
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
was very enamored of German engineers.

228
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So in the 1930s, he hired a whole bunch of them,

229
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
including a man named Hermann Long

230
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who, in 1938,

231
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war --

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which also, by the way, didn't work very well.

234
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

235
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight?

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Well because we live in an age

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
where there are lots and lots

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
of Norden bombsights.

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We live in a time where there are all kinds

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of really, really smart people

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
running around, saying that they've invented gadgets

242
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that will forever change our world.

243
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They've invented websites that will allow people to be free.

244
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They've invented some kind of this thing, or this thing, or this thing

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that will make our world forever better.

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
If you go into the military,

247
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,

249
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"You know what, now we really can

250
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
put a bomb inside a pickle barrel

251
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
at 20,000 ft."

252
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now.

253
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But we need to be very clear

254
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
about how little that means.

255
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War,

256
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the U.S. military, the air force,

257
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles

258
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to the Iraqi desert

259
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
equipped with these five million dollar cameras

260
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that allowed them to see the entire desert floor.

261
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And their mission was to find and to destroy --

262
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
remember the Scud missile launchers,

263
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
those surface-to-air missiles

264
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis?

265
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The mission of the two squadrons

266
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers.

267
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so they flew missions day and night,

268
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and they dropped thousands of bombs,

269
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and they fired thousands of missiles

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge.

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And after the war was over, there was an audit done --

272
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
as the army always does, the air force always does --

273
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and they asked the question:

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
how many Scuds did we actually destroy?

275
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You know what the answer was?

276
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Zero, not a single one.

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Now why is that?

278
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Is it because their weapons weren't accurate?

279
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.

280
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They could have destroyed this little thing right here

281
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
from 25,000 ft.

282
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were.

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The problem with bombs and pickle barrels

284
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel,

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it's knowing how to find the pickle barrel.

286
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That's always been the harder problem

287
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
when it comes to fighting wars.

288
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Or take the battle in Afghanistan.

289
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What is the signature weapon

290
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?

291
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's the drone. What is the drone?

292
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision.

294
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And over the course of the last six years

295
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in Northwest Pakistan,

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles,

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and it's used those drones

298
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to kill 2,000 suspected

299
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Pakistani and Taliban militants.

300
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now what is the accuracy of those drones?

301
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Well it's extraordinary.

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy

303
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
when it comes to drone strikes.

304
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed, right?

305
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
That is one of the most extraordinary records

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in the history of modern warfare.

307
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But do you know what the crucial thing is?

308
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
In that exact same period

309
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that we've been using these drones

310
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
with devastating accuracy,

311
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the number of attacks, of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks,

312
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
against American forces in Afghanistan

313
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
has increased tenfold.

314
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
As we have gotten more and more efficient

315
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in killing them,

316
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
they have become angrier and angrier

317
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and more and more motivated to kill us.

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I have not described to you a success story.

319
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I've described to you

320
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the opposite of a success story.

321
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And this is the problem

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with our infatuation with the things we make.

323
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We think the things we make can solve our problems,

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but our problems are much more complex than that.

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have,

326
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it's how you use the bombs you have,

327
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and more importantly,

328
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
whether you ought to use bombs at all.

329
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
There's a postscript

330
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to the Norden story

331
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And that is, on August 6, 1945,

333
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay

334
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
flew over Japan

335
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and, using a Norden bombsight,

336
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
dropped a very large thermonuclear device

337
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
on the city of Hiroshima.

338
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And as was typical with the Norden bombsight,

339
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft.

340
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But of course, it didn't matter.

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And that's the greatest irony of all

342
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
when it comes to the Norden bombsight.

343
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the air force's 1.5 billion dollar bombsight

344
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb,

345
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
which didn't need a bombsight at all.

346
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Meanwhile, back in New York,

347
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
no one told Carl Norden

348
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima.

349
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He was a committed Christian.

350
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
He thought he had designed something

351
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that would reduce the toll of suffering in war.

352
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It would have broken his heart.

353
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

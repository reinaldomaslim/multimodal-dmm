1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm an American, which means, generally,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I ignore football unless it involves

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
guys my size or Bruno's size

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
running into each other at extremely high speeds.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That said, it's been really hard

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to ignore football

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for the last couple of weeks.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
FIFA, vuvuzela,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
weird jokes about octopi.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that I haven't been able to figure out,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you've probably seen this.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's been a major trending topic.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I went onto Twitter,

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
were more than ready to help.

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They explained that the Galvao bird

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is a rare and endangered parrot

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that's in terrible, terrible danger.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
native to Brazil.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are killed during Carnival parades.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it actually gets worse.

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
very attractive, useful for headdresses,

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which means that there's a terrible problem

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with Galvao abuse.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And it's terribly endangered.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The good news about this is that the global community --

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is pitching in to help out.

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It turns out that Lady Gaga

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
has released a new single --

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
titled "Cala a boca, Galvao."

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And my Brazilian friends tell me that

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
10 cents will be given

49
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to a global campaign

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to save this rare and beautiful bird.

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and actually a very, very good one.

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."

55
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
who's the lead soccer commentator

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
for Rede Globo.

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is that this guy is just a cliche machine.

60
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
He can ruin the most interesting match

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
by just spouting cliche again and again and again.

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So Brazilians went to that first match

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
against North Korea,

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and tried to convince the rest of us

66
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And in fact, were so successful at this

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that it topped Twitter for two weeks.

69
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now there's a couple --

70
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is that you cannot go wrong

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
asking people to be active online,

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So as long as activism is that simple,

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it's pretty easy to get away with.

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The other thing you can take from this, by the way,

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There's more than five million of them.

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
As far as national representation,

81
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Next to Japan,

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it's the second most represented by population.

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks,

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and you didn't realize

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
you're like most of us.

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Because what happens on a social network

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is you interact with the people

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that you have chosen to interact with.

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,

93
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.

94
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And you don't necessarily have the sense

95
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.

96
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans,

97
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
a heavily African-American space.

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Twitter recently did some research.

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They looked at their local population.

100
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They believe that 24 percent

101
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of American Twitter users are African-American.

102
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That's about twice as high as African-Americans

103
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
are represented in the population.

104
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,

105
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but it shouldn't be.

106
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day

107
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you can go into Trending Topics.

108
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you tend to find topics

109
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that are almost entirely African-American conversations.

110
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas

111
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and Martin Wattenberg,

112
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
two amazing visualization designers,

113
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who looked at

114
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic

115
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics

116
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
were basically segregated conversations --

117
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and in ways that you wouldn't expect.

118
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,

119
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that cookout

120
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is a mostly black conversation.

121
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And what's crazy about this is that

122
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,

123
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it's literally a quick click away.

124
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation

125
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
with different people participating in it.

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But generally speaking, most of us don't.

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,

128
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
where we see the people we already know

129
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and the people who are similar to the people we already know.

130
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And we tend not to see that wider picture.

131
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now for me, I'm surprised by this,

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.

133
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you go back into the early days of the internet,

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte

135
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
were writing big books like "Being Digital,"

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the prediction was that the internet

137
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
was going to be an incredibly powerful force

138
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to smooth out cultural differences,

139
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Negroponte started his book with a story

141
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
about how hard it is to build connections

142
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in the world of atoms.

143
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
He's at a technology conference in Florida.

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,

145
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which is bottles of Evian water on the table.

146
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And Negroponte says this is crazy.

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is the old economy.

148
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's the economy of moving these

149
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.

150
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We're heading to the future of bits,

151
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
where everything is speedy, it's weightless.

152
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.

153
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And it's going to change the world as we know it.

154
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.

155
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
He's totally wrong about this one.

156
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It turns out that in many cases

157
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
atoms are much more mobile than bits.

158
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If I walk into a store in the United States,

159
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
it's very, very easy for me to buy water

160
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that's bottled in Fiji,

161
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
shipped at great expense to the United States.

162
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's actually surprisingly hard

163
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for me to see a Fijian feature film.

164
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.

165
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,

166
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There's a coup government. There's a military government.

168
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
There's crackdowns on the press.

169
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It's actually a place that we probably should

170
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
be paying attention to at the moment.

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Here's what I think is going on.

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I think that we tend to look a lot

173
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
at the infrastructure

174
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of globalization.

175
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
We look at the framework that makes it possible

176
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to live in this connected world.

177
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.

178
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It includes things like the Internet cables.

179
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We look at a map like this one,

180
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and it looks like the entire world is flat

181
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because everything is a hop or two away.

182
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You can get on a flight in London,

183
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you can end up in Bangalore later today.

184
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.

185
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's all right there.

186
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When you start looking at what actually

187
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
flows on top of these networks,

188
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you get a very different picture.

189
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
You start looking at how

190
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the global plane flights move,

191
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.

192
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's extremely lumpy.

193
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.

194
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
There's basically a giant pathway in the sky

195
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
between London and New York.

196
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but look at this map, and you can watch this

197
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
for, you know, two or three minutes.

198
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
You won't see very many planes

199
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
go from South America to Africa.

200
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe

201
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that are systematically cut off.

202
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,

203
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we look at what actually happens,

204
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way

205
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that we think it does.

206
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So here's the problem that I've been interested in

207
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in the last decade or so.

208
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The world is, in fact, getting more global.

209
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It's getting more connected.

210
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
More of problems are global in scale.

211
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
More of our economics is global in scale.

212
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And our media is less global by the day.

213
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,

214
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news

215
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
on a nightly new broadcast.

216
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.

217
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.

218
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.

219
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Alisa's the president of Public Radio International.

220
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map

221
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
based on what American

222
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
television news casts

223
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
looked at for a month.

224
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention,

225
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the world within American television news

226
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is basically reduced to

227
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this giant bloated U.S.

228
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.

229
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And that's basically what our media is about.

230
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --

231
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --

232
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,

233
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and I get the same thing.

234
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,

235
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations

236
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and the nations we've invaded.

237
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It turns out that new media

238
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
isn't necessarily helping us all that much.

239
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Here's a map made by Mark Graham

240
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.

241
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia

242
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that have been geo-coded.

243
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias

244
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
towards North America and Western Europe.

245
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Even within Wikipedias,

246
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where we're creating their own content online,

247
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
there's a heavy bias towards the place where

248
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,

249
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
rather than to the rest of the world.

250
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In the U.K., you can get up,

251
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,

252
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,

253
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.

254
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You probably won't.

255
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
If you look at online media consumption --

256
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet --

257
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
more than 95 percent of the news readership

258
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is on domestic news sites.

259
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],

260
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because we actually like reading your media,

261
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
rather than vice versa.

262
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So all of this starts leading me

263
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to think that we're in a state that I refer to

264
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
as imaginary cosmopolitanism.

265
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We look at the internet.

266
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.

267
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,

268
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built

269
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to connect us to the rest of the world.

270
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we forget that most of the time

271
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.

272
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So this is a real problem --

273
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --

274
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but it's a real problem because,

275
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
as we're discussing here at TED,

276
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the real problems in the world

277
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the interesting problems to solve

278
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
are global in scale and scope,

279
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they require global conversations

280
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to get to global solutions.

281
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is a problem we have to solve.

282
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
So here's the good news.

283
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.

284
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is a group called Global Voices.

285
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.

286
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Our mission was to fix the world's media.

287
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We started in 2004.

288
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.

289
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Nor do I think we are by ourselves,

290
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
actually going to solve the problem.

291
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But the more that I think about it, the more that I think

292
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that a few things that we have learned along the way

293
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are interesting lessons for how we would rewire

294
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.

295
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The first thing you have to consider

296
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is that there are parts of the world

297
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that are dark spots in terms of attention.

298
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA --

299
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
they're dark literally because of lack of electricity.

300
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map

301
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
basically meant you're not going to get media from there

302
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because there are more basic needs.

303
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What I'm starting to realize is that

304
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,

305
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and you need an enormous amount of encouragement.

306
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
One of those dark spots is Madagascar,

307
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film

308
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
than it is actually known for

309
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the lovely people who live there.

310
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And so the people who founded

311
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Foko Club in Madagascar

312
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.

313
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They were doing something much simpler.

314
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It was a club to learn English

315
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and to learn computers and the internet.

316
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but what happened was that Madagascar

317
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
went through a violent coup.

318
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Most independent media was shut down.

319
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And the high school students

320
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
who were learning to blog through Foko Club

321
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience

322
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
about the demonstrations, the violence,

323
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
everything that was going on within this country.

324
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So a very, very small program

325
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
designed to get people in front of computers,

326
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,

327
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
ended up having a huge impact

328
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
on what we know about this country.

329
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing

330
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
most people here don't speak Malagasy.

331
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese --

332
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is sort of sad if you think about it,

333
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as it's now the most represented language on the internet.

334
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.

335
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,

336
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
you notice this really cute box at the top,

337
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese

338
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and very quickly at a mouse click

339
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
will give you a translation of the page.

340
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.

341
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,

342
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.

343
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And the results can be pretty funny.

344
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What you really want -- what I really want,

345
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
is eventually the ability to push a button

346
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and have this queued

347
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
so a human being can translate this.

348
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And if you think this is absurd, it's not.

349
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.

350
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And Yeeyan is a group

351
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
of 150,000 volunteers

352
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
who get online every day.

353
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.

354
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
They translate roughly 100 articles a day

355
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
from major newspapers, major websites.

356
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They put it online for free.

357
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,

358
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots

359
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and who couldn't believe how biased

360
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
American media coverage was.

361
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,

362
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
so that people between these countries

363
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
start understanding each other a little bit better."

364
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And my question to you is:

365
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people

366
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to translate the English internet into Chinese,

367
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
where's the English language Yeeyan?

368
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Who's going after Chinese,

369
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
which now has 400 million internet users out there?

370
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.

371
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,

372
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
there's no guarantee that we're going to find it.

373
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
When we look for information online,

374
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we basically have two strategies.

375
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We use a lot of search.

376
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.

377
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But if what you're looking for is serendipity,

378
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
if you want to stumble onto something

379
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that you didn't know you needed,

380
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,

381
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to look for our friends.

382
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.

383
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The problem with this is that essentially

384
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.

385
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You end up flocking with a lot of people

386
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
who are probably similar to you,

387
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
who have similar interests.

388
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And it's very, very hard to get information

389
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world

390
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
where people getting together and talking about their own interests.

391
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
To do this, at a certain point,

392
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.

393
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
You need a guide.

394
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.

395
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.

396
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors

397
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
from killing each other,

398
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
she has to figure out

399
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
what is going to interest you

400
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
about the Middle East.

401
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And in that sense of trying to get you

402
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
out of your normal orbit,

403
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and to try to get you to pay attention

404
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to a story about someone who's

405
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
given up smoking for the month of Ramadan,

406
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
she has to know something about a global audience.

407
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
She has to know something about what stories are available.

408
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Basically, she's a deejay.

409
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
She's a skilled human curator

410
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
who knows what material is available to her,

411
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
who's able to listen to the audience,

412
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and who's able to make a selection

413
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and push people forward in one fashion or another.

414
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.

415
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I think what's great about the internet

416
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
is that it actually makes it much easier

417
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
for deejays to reach a wider audience.

418
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I know Amira.

419
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I can ask her what to read.

420
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can

421
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
tell a lot of people what to read.

422
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And you can listen to her as well,

423
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.

424
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So once you start widening like this,

425
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,

426
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
once you start translating, once you start curating,

427
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
you end up in some really weird places.

428
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,

429
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
which is AfriGadget.

430
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks

431
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
at technology in an Africa context.

432
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith

433
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
in Kibera in Nairobi,

434
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
who is turning the shaft of a Landrover

435
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
into a cold chisel.

436
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,

437
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
"Why would I conceivably care about this?"

438
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.

439
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.

440
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
He goes by the moniker White African.

441
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
He's both a very well known American geek,

442
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.

443
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
He is a bridge figure.

444
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds --

445
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
one in the world of the African technology community,

446
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
one in the world of the American technology community.

447
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And so he's able to tell a story

448
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
about this blacksmith in Kibera

449
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and turn it into a story about repurposing technology,

450
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
about innovating from constraint,

451
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.

452
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
He knows one world,

453
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,

454
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
both of which he has deep connections to.

455
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,

456
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
are the future of how we try to make the world wider

457
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
through using the web.

458
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
But the trick with bridges is, ultimately,

459
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
you need someone to cross them.

460
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles.

461
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
So if I found myself in the NFL,

462
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I suspect I would spend my off-season

463
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth --

464
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
possibly recording a hip-hop album.

465
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Dhani Jones,

466
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,

467
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
has a slightly different approach to the off-season.

468
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Dhani has a television show.

469
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."

470
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And every week on this television show,

471
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Dhani travels to a different nation of the world.

472
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
He finds a local sporting team.

473
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.

474
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And his reason for this

475
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.

476
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
It's because, for him,

477
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
sport is the language

478
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
that allows him to encounter

479
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
the full width and wonder of the world.

480
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.

481
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing.

482
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
But there are all these different techniques

483
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that allow you to go out and look at the world

484
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and find your place within it.

485
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
The goal of my Talk here

486
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
is not to persuade the people in this room

487
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
to embrace your xenophilia.

488
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal --

489
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
is that most of you are xenophiles,

490
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
whether or not you use that term.

491
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
My challenge instead is this.

492
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
It's not enough to make the personal decision

493
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that you want a wider world.

494
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
We have to figure out how to rewire

495
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
the systems that we have.

496
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
We have to fix our media.

497
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.

498
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
We have to fix our immigration policy.

499
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
We need to look at ways

500
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
of creating serendipity,

501
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
of making translation pervasive,

502
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and we need to find ways to embrace

503
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
and celebrate these bridge figures.

504
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.

505
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.

506
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Applause)

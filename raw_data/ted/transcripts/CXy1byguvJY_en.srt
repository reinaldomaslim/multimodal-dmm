1
0:00:13.15,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was a kid,

2
0:00:14.349,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was, like many of you in this room, very much fascinated by Star Wars,

3
0:00:19.273,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and what fascinated me the most is this notion of the Force,

4
0:00:23.773,000 --> 0:00:26,000
this energy that connects all people and all objects

5
0:00:26.907,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and allows you to feel people that you can't even see.

6
0:00:30.753,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I remember many nights, I would be sitting at home,

7
0:00:33.865,000 --> 0:00:36,000
just, like, concentrating and focusing, trying to feel the Force,

8
0:00:38.624,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I didn't feel anything, don't worry.

9
0:00:41.211,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:43.092,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And later in life, I became a scientist.

11
0:00:45.966,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I joined the MIT faculty and started working on wireless signals.

12
0:00:51.184,000 --> 0:00:54,000
These are things like Wi-Fi or cellular systems,

13
0:00:54.351,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I did a lot of work in that domain.

14
0:00:57.489,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But then, again, this Force thing kept nagging me,

15
0:01:02.102,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and at some point, I was just like,

16
0:01:04.051,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Wait a minute, these wireless signals -- they are like the Force."

17
0:01:08.727,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So if you think about it,

18
0:01:09.945,000 --> 0:01:11,000
wireless signals, they travel through space,

19
0:01:12.6,000 --> 0:01:15,000
they go through obstacles and walls and occlusions,

20
0:01:16.104,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and some of them,

21
0:01:17.369,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they reflect off our bodies, because our bodies are full of water,

22
0:01:21.543,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and some of these minute reflections,

23
0:01:23.773,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they come back.

24
0:01:25.055,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And if, just if, I had a device that can just sense these minute reflections,

25
0:01:32.05,000 --> 0:01:34,000
then I would be able to feel people that I cannot see.

26
0:01:36.444,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I started working with my students on building such a device,

27
0:01:40.221,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I want to show you some of our early results.

28
0:01:44.584,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So here, you see my student standing,

29
0:01:46.891,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and here is our device.

30
0:01:48.892,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And we are going to put the device in the other office, behind the wall,

31
0:01:54.526,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we are going to monitor him as he moves.

32
0:01:57.367,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This red dot is tracking him using wireless signals.

33
0:02:02.76,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And as you can see, the red dot is tracking his movements very accurately,

34
0:02:07.568,000 --> 0:02:11,000
purely based on how his body interacts with the surrounding wireless signals.

35
0:02:13.631,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Pretty accurate, isn't it?

36
0:02:16.702,000 --> 0:02:17,000
He has no wearables, nothing.

37
0:02:18.599,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:21.437,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now you might be wondering,

39
0:02:23.206,000 --> 0:02:26,000
how is it possible that we can sense people

40
0:02:26.412,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and track them, without any wearables, through walls,

41
0:02:30.282,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the easiest analogy to think about is radar.

42
0:02:33.672,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm sure many of you have seen this picture.

43
0:02:35.789,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You transmit a wireless signal to the sky,

44
0:02:37.971,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it reflects off some airplane, comes back to you,

45
0:02:40.963,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and you start detecting these airplanes.

46
0:02:44.328,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But if it were just radar,

47
0:02:46.296,000 --> 0:02:48,000
then we would have this 50 years ago.

48
0:02:49.272,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So it's not just radar.

49
0:02:51.285,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There are two key differences.

50
0:02:54.229,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So the first difference, of course --

51
0:02:56.016,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you can't, like radar, just blast wireless power at somebody.

52
0:02:59.559,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You're going to fry them like if they were in a microwave.

53
0:03:02.31,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Don't do that.

54
0:03:04.595,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So it means that you have to be able to deal with very weak signals,

55
0:03:09.684,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and that means that your device has to be very sensitive.

56
0:03:14.144,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The second difference is that, unlike the sky, where it's empty --

57
0:03:18.299,000 --> 0:03:21,000
if you are lucky, there is one airplane that you can catch there.

58
0:03:21.467,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Like, look at the room

59
0:03:22.833,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and look how many objects and people there are.

60
0:03:25.745,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So in indoor environments, the signal not only reflects off the person,

61
0:03:29.706,000 --> 0:03:32,000
if reflects off the person, off the floor, the ceiling,

62
0:03:33.523,000 --> 0:03:35,000
off other people around,

63
0:03:35.769,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and you get very complex reflections

64
0:03:37.776,000 --> 0:03:39,000
where the same signal reflects off me and then off you,

65
0:03:40.531,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then off the ceiling, then off the floor.

66
0:03:42.793,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And you have to make sense of that mess.

67
0:03:47.993,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But we were lucky.

68
0:03:49.866,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We were coming at the right time.

69
0:03:53.252,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So two things helped us.

70
0:03:55.148,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The first thing is radiotechnologies have evolved a lot,

71
0:03:59.228,000 --> 0:04:,000
and over the last decade,

72
0:04:01.027,000 --> 0:04:03,000
radio technology became much more powerful,

73
0:04:03.361,000 --> 0:04:06,000
so we were able to build very sensitive radios

74
0:04:07.122,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that can sense weak and minute RF signals.

75
0:04:11.725,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The second thing: machine learning.

76
0:04:14.788,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So you keep hearing about machine learning

77
0:04:16.812,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and there was a revolution of machine learning recently,

78
0:04:19.797,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in deep learning,

79
0:04:20.972,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and that allowed us to build machine-learning models

80
0:04:24.765,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that can understand wireless signals and interpret them

81
0:04:28.336,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so they would know what happened in the environment.

82
0:04:31.865,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So if you think of it, the radio is like the ear of our device

83
0:04:35.699,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and the machine learning is like the brain,

84
0:04:38.302,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and together, they have a very powerful device.

85
0:04:44.108,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So what else can we sense about people using wireless signals?

86
0:04:50.458,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Sleep.

87
0:04:51.633,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Sleep, actually, is something very dear to my heart,

88
0:04:54.086,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because my sleep is a disaster.

89
0:04:56.037,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:57.409,000 --> 0:05:,000
So one thing is when you start working on some physiological signal

91
0:05:00.662,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and you discover that yours sucks.

92
0:05:03.908,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:07.344,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So you can see why we can capture sleep,

94
0:05:09.494,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because the person walks and the device sees him as he walks to bed,

95
0:05:12.784,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when he stops tossing around in bed,

96
0:05:15.083,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when he steps out of bed,

97
0:05:16.948,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and that measure of sleep is what people call actigraphy.

98
0:05:20.67,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's based on motion.

99
0:05:23.087,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But it turned out that we can actually get sleep

100
0:05:26.405,000 --> 0:05:28,000
at a much more important level.

101
0:05:28.816,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We can understand the change in the brain waves

102
0:05:32.404,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that occur during sleep.

103
0:05:35.403,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So, many of you probably know that as we go to sleep,

104
0:05:38.38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
our brainwaves change and we enter different stages:

105
0:05:41.777,000 --> 0:05:45,000
awake, light sleep, deep sleep and REM, or rapid eye movement.

106
0:05:46.267,000 --> 0:05:5,000
These stages are of course related to sleep disorders,

107
0:05:50.625,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but they are also related to various diseases.

108
0:05:53.759,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So for example, disturbances in REM are associated with depression.

109
0:05:59.718,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Disturbances in deep sleep are associated with Alzheimer's.

110
0:06:04.614,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So if you want to get sleep staging,

111
0:06:07.177,000 --> 0:06:09,000
today, you will send the person to the hospital,

112
0:06:09.511,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they put all of these electrodes on their head,

113
0:06:12.089,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they ask them to sleep like that.

114
0:06:13.943,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:16.027,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's not really a happy experience.

116
0:06:20.155,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So what if I tell you that I can do the same thing

117
0:06:23.115,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but without any of these electrodes on the person's body?

118
0:06:27.596,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So here is our device,

119
0:06:29.492,000 --> 0:06:31,000
transmitting very low power wireless signal,

120
0:06:32.278,000 --> 0:06:34,000
analyzes the reflections using AI

121
0:06:34.414,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and spits out the sleep stages throughout the night.

122
0:06:38.647,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So we know, for example, when this person is dreaming.

123
0:06:44.333,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Not just that ...

124
0:06:46.691,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we can even get your breathing while you are sitting like that,

125
0:06:49.802,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and without touching you.

126
0:06:51.399,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So he is sitting and reading

127
0:06:53.025,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and this is his inhales, exhales.

128
0:06:55.994,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We asked him to hold his breath,

129
0:06:58.009,000 --> 0:07:,000
and you see the signal staying at a steady level

130
0:07:00.899,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because he exhaled.

131
0:07:02.074,000 --> 0:07:03,000
He did not inhale.

132
0:07:05.279,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And I want to zoom in on the signal.

133
0:07:07.787,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And this is the same signal as before.

134
0:07:09.874,000 --> 0:07:1,000
These are the inhales,

135
0:07:11.579,000 --> 0:07:12,000
these are the exhales.

136
0:07:13.247,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And you see these blips on the signal?

137
0:07:15.358,000 --> 0:07:16,000
These are not noise.

138
0:07:17.159,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They are his heartbeats.

139
0:07:19.971,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And you can see them beat by beat.

140
0:07:23.439,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I want to stop here for a moment and show you a live demo.

141
0:07:27.684,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Zach is going to help me with the demo,

142
0:07:29.779,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we're going to use the device to monitor Zach's breathing.

143
0:07:35.272,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So this white box that you see here is the device,

144
0:07:39.064,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and Zach is turning it on ...

145
0:07:43.581,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and let's see whether he breathes well.

146
0:07:46.146,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So we're going to do exactly what we did in the video with the other guy,

147
0:07:50.772,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so the wireless signal is going through,

148
0:07:53.487,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it's touching Zach's body,

149
0:07:55.161,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and it's reflecting back to the device,

150
0:07:57.408,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we want to monitor his breathing, his inhale-exhale motion.

151
0:08:00.803,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we see the inhales, exhales --

152
0:08:03.35,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so see, these ups and downs are Zach breathing.

153
0:08:10.191,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Inhaling, exhaling.

154
0:08:12.366,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:17.992,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So, he can breathe.

156
0:08:20.168,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:21.613,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Zach, can you hold your breath, please?

158
0:08:25.216,000 --> 0:08:28,000
OK, so now he's holding his breath,

159
0:08:28.303,000 --> 0:08:3,000
so you see the signal stays at a steady level,

160
0:08:30.581,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and these are his heartbeats.

161
0:08:32.231,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.

162
0:08:35.731,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

163
0:08:36.756,000 --> 0:08:38,000
OK, Zach, you can breathe again.

164
0:08:38.947,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:40.86,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We don't want accidents here.

166
0:08:42.304,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:43.329,000 --> 0:08:44,000
OK, thank you.

168
0:08:45.756,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Applause)

169
0:08:51.716,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So as you can see, we have this device

170
0:08:54.501,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that can monitor so many physiological signals for you,

171
0:08:58.065,000 --> 0:09:,000
and what is really interesting about this device

172
0:09:01.049,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is that it does all this without any wearables,

173
0:09:03.636,000 --> 0:09:05,000
without asking the person to change his behavior

174
0:09:06.358,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or to wear anything or charge anything special.

175
0:09:09.739,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And that got doctors very excited,

176
0:09:12.731,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because doctors,

177
0:09:13.906,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they always want to know more information about their patients,

178
0:09:16.887,000 --> 0:09:17,000
particularly at home,

179
0:09:18.081,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and this is particularly true in chronic diseases,

180
0:09:20.739,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like pulmonary diseases, like COPD,

181
0:09:24.918,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or heart failure or Alzheimer's and even depression.

182
0:09:29.466,000 --> 0:09:31,000
All of these chronic diseases are very important.

183
0:09:31.807,000 --> 0:09:33,000
In fact -- perhaps you know --

184
0:09:34.299,000 --> 0:09:36,000
two-thirds of the cost of health care in the US

185
0:09:37.203,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is due to chronic diseases.

186
0:09:39.545,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But what is really interesting about chronic diseases

187
0:09:42.1,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is that when the person, for example,

188
0:09:43.944,000 --> 0:09:47,000
has a problem that leads to the hospital and the emergency room,

189
0:09:48.705,000 --> 0:09:5,000
this problem doesn't happen overnight.

190
0:09:51.044,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Actually, things happen gradually.

191
0:09:53.147,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So if we can monitor chronic disease patients in their home,

192
0:09:56.893,000 --> 0:10:,000
we can detect changes in their breathing, heartbeat, mobility, sleep --

193
0:10:01.178,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and we can detect emergencies before they occur

194
0:10:05.384,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and have the doctor intervene earlier

195
0:10:07.725,000 --> 0:10:09,000
so that we can avoid hospitalization.

196
0:10:10.645,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And indeed, today we are working with multiple doctors

197
0:10:14.771,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in different disease categories.

198
0:10:16.754,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So I'm really excited

199
0:10:17.961,000 --> 0:10:19,000
because we have deployed the device with many patients.

200
0:10:20.669,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We have deployed the device with patients that have COPD,

201
0:10:24.025,000 --> 0:10:25,000
which is a pulmonary disease,

202
0:10:25.556,000 --> 0:10:27,000
patients that have Alzheimer's,

203
0:10:27.635,000 --> 0:10:29,000
patients that have depression and anxiety

204
0:10:29.952,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and people that have Parkinson's.

205
0:10:32.798,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we are working with the doctors on improving their life,

206
0:10:35.705,000 --> 0:10:36,000
understanding the disease better.

207
0:10:38.718,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So when I started, I told you

208
0:10:41.313,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars and the Force in Star Wars,

209
0:10:46.757,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and indeed, I'm still very much fascinated,

210
0:10:50.107,000 --> 0:10:52,000
even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars,

211
0:10:52.137,000 --> 0:10:54,000
waiting for the next movie.

212
0:10:54.456,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But I'm very fascinated now and excited

213
0:10:59.749,000 --> 0:11:02,000
about this new Force of wireless signals,

214
0:11:03.571,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and the potential of changing health care with this new force.

215
0:11:07.601,000 --> 0:11:09,000
One of the patients with whom we deployed is actually my aunt.

216
0:11:10.569,000 --> 0:11:12,000
She has heart failure,

217
0:11:12.744,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and I'm sure many of you guys in the audience

218
0:11:16.476,000 --> 0:11:2,000
have parents, grandparents, loved ones who have chronic diseases.

219
0:11:21.188,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So I want you to imagine with me a future

220
0:11:24.07,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where in every home that has a chronic disease patient,

221
0:11:26.976,000 --> 0:11:29,000
there is a device like this device sitting in the background

222
0:11:30.125,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and just monitoring passively

223
0:11:32.514,000 --> 0:11:36,000
sleep, breathing, the health of this chronic disease patient,

224
0:11:37.204,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and before an emergency occurs,

225
0:11:39.352,000 --> 0:11:42,000
it would detect the degradation in the physiological signal

226
0:11:42.399,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and alert the doctor

227
0:11:43.923,000 --> 0:11:45,000
so that we can avoid hospitalization.

228
0:11:46.652,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This can change health care as we know it today,

229
0:11:49.803,000 --> 0:11:52,000
improve how we understand chronic diseases

230
0:11:52.827,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and also save many lives.

231
0:11:54.898,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Thank you.

232
0:11:56.073,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

233
0:12:01.231,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Helen Walters: Dina, thank you so much.

234
0:12:03.142,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you too, Zach.

235
0:12:04.317,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So glad you're breathing.

236
0:12:05.652,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So Dina, this is amazing.

237
0:12:08.373,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The positive applications are incredible.

238
0:12:11.425,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What is the framework, though, like the ethical framework around this?

239
0:12:15.444,000 --> 0:12:17,000
What are you doing to prevent this technology from being used

240
0:12:18.348,000 --> 0:12:21,000
for other, perhaps less positive types of applications?

241
0:12:22.141,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Dina Katabi: Yeah, this is a very important question, of course,

242
0:12:25.22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
like, what about misuse,

243
0:12:26.413,000 --> 0:12:29,000
or what about, I guess you could say, about the Dark Side of the Force?

244
0:12:30.059,000 --> 0:12:31,000
HW: Right, right.

245
0:12:31.257,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:33.368,000 --> 0:12:36,000
DK: So we actually have technologies

247
0:12:36.891,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that prevent people from trying to use this device

248
0:12:41.192,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to monitor somebody without their consent.

249
0:12:43.57,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Because the device understands space,

250
0:12:45.847,000 --> 0:12:48,000
it will ask you to prove, by doing certain movements,

251
0:12:49.292,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that you have access to the space

252
0:12:51.071,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and you are the person who you are asking the device to monitor.

253
0:12:54.395,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So technology-wise,

254
0:12:56.609,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we have technology that we integrate to prevent misuse,

255
0:13:00.021,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but also, I think there is a role for policy, like everything else,

256
0:13:03.935,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and hopefully, with the two of them, we can control any misuse.

257
0:13:09.395,000 --> 0:13:1,000
HW: Amazing. Thank you so much.

258
0:13:10.976,000 --> 0:13:11,000
DK: Thank you.

259
0:13:12.151,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Applause)

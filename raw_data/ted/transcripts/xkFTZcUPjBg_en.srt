1
0:00:13.014,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'll begin today

2
0:00:14.825,000 --> 0:00:16,000
by sharing a poem

3
0:00:16.891,000 --> 0:00:19,000
written by my friend from Malawi,

4
0:00:20.026,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Eileen Piri.

5
0:00:22.162,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Eileen is only 13 years old,

6
0:00:25.506,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote,

7
0:00:31.38,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I found her poem so interesting,

8
0:00:34.248,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so motivating.

9
0:00:36.245,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So I'll read it to you.

10
0:00:38.905,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She entitled her poem "I'll Marry When I Want."

11
0:00:42.503,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:45.359,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"I'll marry when I want.

13
0:00:47.89,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My mother can't force me to marry.

14
0:00:52.79,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My father cannot force me to marry.

15
0:00:57.526,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My uncle, my aunt,

16
0:01:00.336,000 --> 0:01:02,000
my brother or sister,

17
0:01:02.681,000 --> 0:01:04,000
cannot force me to marry.

18
0:01:05.885,000 --> 0:01:07,000
No one in the world

19
0:01:08.254,000 --> 0:01:11,000
can force me to marry.

20
0:01:11.55,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'll marry when I want.

21
0:01:14.499,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Even if you beat me,

22
0:01:17.077,000 --> 0:01:19,000
even if you chase me away,

23
0:01:19.747,000 --> 0:01:22,000
even if you do anything bad to me,

24
0:01:22.928,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'll marry when I want.

25
0:01:26.364,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'll marry when I want,

26
0:01:29.267,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but not before I am well educated,

27
0:01:33.005,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and not before I am all grown up.

28
0:01:37.323,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'll marry when I want."

29
0:01:40.831,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This poem might seem odd,

30
0:01:43.827,000 --> 0:01:46,000
written by a 13-year-old girl,

31
0:01:47.356,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but where I and Eileen come from,

32
0:01:52.139,000 --> 0:01:55,000
this poem, which I have just read to you,

33
0:01:55.9,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is a warrior's cry.

34
0:01:59.616,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I am from Malawi.

35
0:02:03.191,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Malawi is one of the poorest countries,

36
0:02:07.115,000 --> 0:02:09,000
very poor,

37
0:02:09.994,000 --> 0:02:13,000
where gender equality is questionable.

38
0:02:14.522,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Growing up in that country,

39
0:02:16.844,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I couldn't make my own choices in life.

40
0:02:20.095,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I couldn't even explore

41
0:02:22.393,000 --> 0:02:24,000
personal opportunities in life.

42
0:02:25.389,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I will tell you a story

43
0:02:27.919,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of two different girls,

44
0:02:30.381,000 --> 0:02:33,000
two beautiful girls.

45
0:02:34.026,000 --> 0:02:36,000
These girls grew up

46
0:02:36.58,000 --> 0:02:38,000
under the same roof.

47
0:02:38.693,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They were eating the same food.

48
0:02:41.41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Sometimes, they would share clothes,

49
0:02:44.173,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and even shoes.

50
0:02:46.982,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But their lives ended up differently,

51
0:02:51.649,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in two different paths.

52
0:02:55.039,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The other girl is my little sister.

53
0:02:58.754,000 --> 0:03:02,000
My little sister was only 11 years old

54
0:03:03.677,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when she got pregnant.

55
0:03:08.029,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's a hurtful thing.

56
0:03:13.352,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Not only did it hurt her, even me.

57
0:03:16.633,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I was going through a hard time as well.

58
0:03:20.232,000 --> 0:03:23,000
As it is in my culture,

59
0:03:23.947,000 --> 0:03:25,000
once you reach puberty stage,

60
0:03:26.942,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you are supposed to go to initiation camps.

61
0:03:30.82,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In these initiation camps,

62
0:03:33.118,000 --> 0:03:36,000
you are taught how to sexually please a man.

63
0:03:36.973,000 --> 0:03:37,000
There is this special day,

64
0:03:38.761,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which they call "Very Special Day"

65
0:03:41.965,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where a man who is hired by the community

66
0:03:44.519,000 --> 0:03:46,000
comes to the camp

67
0:03:47.143,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and sleeps with the little girls.

68
0:03:51.252,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Imagine the trauma that these young girls

69
0:03:53.766,000 --> 0:03:55,000
go through every day.

70
0:03:58.766,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Most girls end up pregnant.

71
0:04:01.925,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They even contract HIV and AIDS

72
0:04:04.542,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and other sexually transmitted diseases.

73
0:04:07.692,000 --> 0:04:11,000
For my little sister, she ended up being pregnant.

74
0:04:12.603,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Today, she's only 16 years old

75
0:04:16.666,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and she has three children.

76
0:04:19.662,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Her first marriage did not survive,

77
0:04:23.307,000 --> 0:04:26,000
nor did her second marriage.

78
0:04:26.604,000 --> 0:04:3,000
On the other side, there is this girl.

79
0:04:31.341,000 --> 0:04:32,000
She's amazing.

80
0:04:33.314,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:35.218,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

82
0:04:39.723,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I call her amazing because she is.

83
0:04:42.138,000 --> 0:04:45,000
She's very fabulous.

84
0:04:45.203,000 --> 0:04:48,000
That girl is me. (Laughter)

85
0:04:48.964,000 --> 0:04:51,000
When I was 13 years old,

86
0:04:51.982,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I was told, you are grown up,

87
0:04:55.396,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you have now reached of age,

88
0:04:58.228,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you're supposed to go to the initiation camp.

89
0:05:01.595,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I was like, "What?

90
0:05:04.567,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'm not going to go to the initiation camps."

91
0:05:10.349,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know what the women said to me?

92
0:05:13.112,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.

93
0:05:16.734,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You do not respect the traditions of our society, of our community."

94
0:05:24.001,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I said no because I knew where I was going.

95
0:05:27.809,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I knew what I wanted in life.

96
0:05:31.773,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.

97
0:05:36.238,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I wanted to get well educated,

98
0:05:39.883,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to find a decent job in the future.

99
0:05:42.363,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I was imagining myself as a lawyer,

100
0:05:44.122,000 --> 0:05:46,000
seated on that big chair.

101
0:05:46.832,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Those were the imaginations that

102
0:05:49.138,000 --> 0:05:52,000
were going through my mind every day.

103
0:05:52.468,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I knew that one day,

104
0:05:54.302,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I would contribute something, a little something to my community.

105
0:05:58.876,000 --> 0:06:,000
But every day after refusing,

106
0:06:01.407,000 --> 0:06:03,000
women would tell me,

107
0:06:03.427,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Look at you, you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby.

108
0:06:06.817,000 --> 0:06:07,000
What about you?"

109
0:06:08.303,000 --> 0:06:12,000
That was the music that I was hearing every day,

110
0:06:13.017,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that is the music that girls hear every day

111
0:06:16.894,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when they don't do something that the community needs them to do.

112
0:06:23.524,000 --> 0:06:26,000
When I compared the two stories between me and my sister,

113
0:06:27.448,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I said, "Why can't I do something?

114
0:06:32.185,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time

115
0:06:37.246,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in our community?"

116
0:06:39.661,000 --> 0:06:41,000
That was when I called other girls

117
0:06:42.169,000 --> 0:06:44,000
just like my sister, who have children,

118
0:06:44.723,000 --> 0:06:47,000
who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write.

119
0:06:48.187,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I said, "Come on, we can remind each other

120
0:06:50.297,000 --> 0:06:52,000
how to read and write again,

121
0:06:52.432,000 --> 0:06:55,000
how to hold the pen, how to read, to hold the book."

122
0:06:56.24,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It was a great time I had with them.

123
0:06:59.885,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Nor did I just learn a little about them,

124
0:07:04.157,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but they were able to tell me their personal stories,

125
0:07:07.594,000 --> 0:07:08,000
what they were facing every day

126
0:07:09.405,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as young mothers.

127
0:07:12.075,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That was when I was like,

128
0:07:14.072,000 --> 0:07:17,000
'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us

129
0:07:17.996,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and present them and tell our mothers, our traditional leaders,

130
0:07:21.873,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that these are the wrong things?"

131
0:07:23.87,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It was a scary thing to do,

132
0:07:25.937,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because these traditional leaders,

133
0:07:27.91,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they are already accustomed to the things

134
0:07:30.114,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that have been there for ages.

135
0:07:32.554,000 --> 0:07:33,000
A hard thing to change,

136
0:07:34.481,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but a good thing to try.

137
0:07:37.105,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So we tried.

138
0:07:39.357,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It was very hard, but we pushed.

139
0:07:42.245,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I'm here to say that in my community,

140
0:07:45.109,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it was the first community after girls

141
0:07:47.669,000 --> 0:07:5,000
pushed so hard to our traditional leader,

142
0:07:51.036,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married

143
0:07:55.425,000 --> 0:07:57,000
before the age of 18.

144
0:07:57.654,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

145
0:08:05.502,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In my community,

146
0:08:07.243,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that was the first time a community,

147
0:08:09.89,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they had to call the bylaws,

148
0:08:12.351,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the first bylaw that protected girls

149
0:08:15.858,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in our community.

150
0:08:18.052,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We did not stop there.

151
0:08:19.84,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We forged ahead.

152
0:08:22.789,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community,

153
0:08:26.643,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but even in other communities.

154
0:08:29.429,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When the child marriage bill was being presented in February,

155
0:08:33.562,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we were there at the Parliament house.

156
0:08:37.208,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Every day, when the members of Parliament were entering,

157
0:08:41.294,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we were telling them, "Would you please support the bill?"

158
0:08:44.383,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And we don't have much technology like here,

159
0:08:49.142,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but we have our small phones.

160
0:08:51.139,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So we said, "Why can't we get their numbers and text them?"

161
0:08:56.178,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So we did that. It was a good thing.

162
0:08:59.428,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Applause)

163
0:09:01.448,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So when the bill passed, we texted them back,

164
0:09:04.421,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"Thank you for supporting the bill."

165
0:09:06.849,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

166
0:09:07.919,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And when the bill was signed by the president,

167
0:09:11.264,000 --> 0:09:14,000
making it into law, it was a plus.

168
0:09:14.63,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal marriage age, from 15 to 18.

169
0:09:20.482,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

170
0:09:26.495,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's a good thing to know that the bill passed,

171
0:09:30.071,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but let me tell you this:

172
0:09:33.113,000 --> 0:09:37,000
There are countries where 18 is the legal marriage age,

173
0:09:37.501,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day?

174
0:09:41.773,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Every day, girls' lives are being wasted away.

175
0:09:47.416,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment.

176
0:09:53.87,000 --> 0:09:55,000
In honoring this commitment,

177
0:09:56.239,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time.

178
0:10:01.951,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We don't have to be subjected as second,

179
0:10:05.712,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but they have to know that women, as we are in this room,

180
0:10:09.95,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we are not just women, we are not just girls,

181
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we are extraordinary.

182
0:10:14.98,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We can do more.

183
0:10:16.893,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And another thing for Malawi,

184
0:10:19.888,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and not just Malawi but other countries:

185
0:10:22.79,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The laws which are there,

186
0:10:26.575,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced?

187
0:10:32.426,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The law which has just recently passed

188
0:10:35.839,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the laws that in other countries have been there,

189
0:10:38.463,000 --> 0:10:41,000
they need to be publicized at the local level,

190
0:10:42.387,000 --> 0:10:44,000
at the community level,

191
0:10:44.57,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where girls' issues are very striking.

192
0:10:49.956,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Girls face issues, difficult issues, at the community level every day.

193
0:10:55.274,000 --> 0:11:,000
So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them,

194
0:11:00.359,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they will be able to stand up and defend themselves

195
0:11:03.145,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because they will know that there is a law that protects them.

196
0:11:09.254,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And another thing I would say is that

197
0:11:13.363,000 --> 0:11:17,000
girls' voices and women's voices

198
0:11:17.961,000 --> 0:11:19,000
are beautiful, they are there,

199
0:11:20.724,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but we cannot do this alone.

200
0:11:23.905,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Male advocates, they have to jump in,

201
0:11:26.575,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to step in and work together.

202
0:11:28.525,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's a collective work.

203
0:11:31.103,000 --> 0:11:33,000
What we need is what girls elsewhere need:

204
0:11:33.843,000 --> 0:11:38,000
good education, and above all, not to marry whilst 11.

205
0:11:42.085,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And furthermore,

206
0:11:44.953,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I know that together,

207
0:11:48.018,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we can transform the legal,

208
0:11:51.966,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the cultural and political framework

209
0:11:55.135,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that denies girls of their rights.

210
0:11:59.906,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I am standing here today

211
0:12:04.964,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation.

212
0:12:12.677,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This is the moment

213
0:12:14.86,000 --> 0:12:18,000
where a girl and a girl, and millions of girls worldwide,

214
0:12:19.294,000 --> 0:12:21,000
will be able to say,

215
0:12:21.895,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"I will marry when I want."

216
0:12:25.099,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

217
0:12:35.284,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Thank you. (Applause)

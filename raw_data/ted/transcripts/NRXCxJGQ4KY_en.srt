0:00:12.916,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was preparing for this talk,

2
0:00:15.17,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I went to search for a couple of quotes

3
0:00:17.146,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that I can share with you.

4
0:00:18.991,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Good news: I found three

5
0:00:21.162,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I particularly liked,

6
0:00:22.994,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,

7
0:00:26.472,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"When making your choice in life,

8
0:00:28.712,000 --> 0:00:3,000
do not forget to live,"

9
0:00:31.468,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that

10
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"

11
0:00:39.305,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and the third is one by Groucho Marx

12
0:00:42.83,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong

13
0:00:45.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to any club that would have me as a member."

14
0:00:51.252,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, bad news:

15
0:00:53.318,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I didn't know which one of these quotes

16
0:00:55.429,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to choose and share with you.

17
0:00:58.178,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The sweet anxiety of choice.

18
0:01:01.403,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In today's times of post-industrial capitalism,

19
0:01:05.446,000 --> 0:01:08,000
choice, together with individual freedom

20
0:01:09.109,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and the idea of self-making,

21
0:01:11.97,000 --> 0:01:14,000
has been elevated to an ideal.

22
0:01:15.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, together with this, we also have a belief

23
0:01:19.387,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in endless progress.

24
0:01:22.155,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But the underside of this ideology

25
0:01:24.911,000 --> 0:01:27,000
has been an increase of anxiety,

26
0:01:28.443,000 --> 0:01:3,000
feelings of guilt,

27
0:01:30.513,000 --> 0:01:33,000
feelings of being inadequate,

28
0:01:34.217,000 --> 0:01:38,000
feeling that we are failing in our choices.

29
0:01:38.954,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Sadly, this ideology of individual choice

30
0:01:42.95,000 --> 0:01:47,000
has prevented us from thinking about social changes.

31
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It appears that this ideology was actually

32
0:01:51.319,000 --> 0:01:53,000
very efficient in pacifying us

33
0:01:54.001,000 --> 0:01:56,000
as political and social thinkers.

34
0:01:56.797,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Instead of making social critiques,

35
0:01:59.113,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we are more and more engaging in self-critique,

36
0:02:02.869,000 --> 0:02:06,000
sometimes to the point of self-destruction.

37
0:02:07.122,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, how come that ideology of choice

38
0:02:09.867,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is still so powerful,

39
0:02:11.45,000 --> 0:02:14,000
even among people who have

40
0:02:14.546,000 --> 0:02:16,000
not many things to choose among?

41
0:02:16.655,000 --> 0:02:19,000
How come that even people who are poor

42
0:02:20.229,000 --> 0:02:24,000
very much still identify with the idea of choice,

43
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the kind of rational idea of choice

44
0:02:26.689,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which we embrace?

45
0:02:29.322,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, the ideology of choice is very successful

46
0:02:33.34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in opening for us a space to think

47
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
about some imagined future.

48
0:02:40.987,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Let me give you an example.

49
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
My friend Manya,

50
0:02:44.913,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when she was a student at university in California,

51
0:02:47.962,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was earning money

52
0:02:49.66,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by working for a car dealer.

53
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, Manya, when she encountered

54
0:02:54.531,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the typical customer, would debate with him

55
0:02:57.389,000 --> 0:02:58,000
about his lifestyle,

56
0:02:59.233,000 --> 0:03:01,000
how much he wants to spend,

57
0:03:01.956,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how many children he has,

58
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:05,000
what does he need the car for?

59
0:03:05.973,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They would usually come to a good conclusion

60
0:03:08.66,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what would be a perfect car.

61
0:03:11.214,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, before Manya's customer would go home

62
0:03:14.702,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and think things through,

63
0:03:17.14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
she would say to him,

64
0:03:18.96,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"The car that you are buying now is perfect,

65
0:03:22.745,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but in a few year's time,

66
0:03:24.77,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when your kids will be already out of the house,

67
0:03:27.403,000 --> 0:03:29,000
when you will have a little bit more money,

68
0:03:30.37,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that other car will be ideal.

69
0:03:33.399,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But what you are buying now is great."

70
0:03:36.936,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, the majority of Manya's customers

71
0:03:39.293,000 --> 0:03:4,000
who came back the next day

72
0:03:40.913,000 --> 0:03:42,000
bought that other car,

73
0:03:43.738,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the car they did not need,

74
0:03:45.795,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the car that cost far too much money.

75
0:03:48.833,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, Manya became so successful in selling cars

76
0:03:51.769,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that soon she moved on to selling airplanes.

77
0:03:54.671,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:59.265,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And knowing so much about the psychology of people

79
0:04:03.35,000 --> 0:04:04,000
prepared her well for her current job,

80
0:04:04.924,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which is that of a psychoanalyst.

81
0:04:08.755,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, why were Manya's customers so irrational?

82
0:04:13.278,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Manya's success was that she was able

83
0:04:15.775,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to open in their heads an image

84
0:04:18.7,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of an idealized future,

85
0:04:22.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
an image of themselves

86
0:04:24.19,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when they are already more successful, freer,

87
0:04:28.42,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and for them, choosing that other car

88
0:04:30.669,000 --> 0:04:33,000
was as if they are coming closer to this ideal

89
0:04:33.729,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in which it was as if Manya already saw them.

90
0:04:38.578,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.

91
0:04:42.981,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Choices are influenced by our unconscious,

92
0:04:46.559,000 --> 0:04:47,000
by our community.

93
0:04:48.398,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We're often choosing

94
0:04:50.328,000 --> 0:04:52,000
by guessing, what would other people

95
0:04:52.482,000 --> 0:04:54,000
think about our choice?

96
0:04:55.466,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Also we are choosing

97
0:04:56.671,000 --> 0:04:58,000
by looking at what others are choosing.

98
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice.

99
0:05:03.845,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, because of this, we actually

100
0:05:06.916,000 --> 0:05:07,000
even after we have already chosen,

101
0:05:08.805,000 --> 0:05:09,000
like bought a car,

102
0:05:10.56,000 --> 0:05:13,000
endlessly read reviews about cars,

103
0:05:13.71,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as if we still want to convince ourselves

104
0:05:16.07,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that we made the right choice.

105
0:05:18.671,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.

106
0:05:21.87,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They are linked to risks, losses.

107
0:05:24.951,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They are highly unpredictable.

108
0:05:27.306,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, because of this,

109
0:05:29.415,000 --> 0:05:31,000
people have now more and more problems

110
0:05:31.918,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that they are not choosing anything.

111
0:05:35.376,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,

112
0:05:39.207,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I met a young, beautiful woman

113
0:05:41.511,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice.

114
0:05:46.137,000 --> 0:05:47,000
She said to me, "I needed one month

115
0:05:48.108,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to decide which dress to wear."

116
0:05:51.154,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Then she said, "For weeks I was researching

117
0:05:53.675,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which hotel to stay for this one night.

118
0:05:56.936,000 --> 0:06:,000
And now, I need to choose a sperm donor."

119
0:06:01.434,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:04.201,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I looked at this woman in shock.

121
0:06:07.7,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"

122
0:06:10.737,000 --> 0:06:14,000
She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,

123
0:06:14.911,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."

124
0:06:19.736,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now choice, because it's linked to risk,

125
0:06:24.142,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is anxiety-provoking,

126
0:06:26.419,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and it was already the famous

127
0:06:29.276,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard

128
0:06:31.869,000 --> 0:06:33,000
who pointed out that anxiety

129
0:06:34.583,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is linked to the possibility of possibility.

130
0:06:37.848,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.

131
0:06:42.281,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We have endless market analysis,

132
0:06:45.362,000 --> 0:06:47,000
projections of the future earnings.

133
0:06:47.871,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Even with market, which is about chance,

134
0:06:50.571,000 --> 0:06:54,000
randomness, we think we can predict rationally

135
0:06:54.711,000 --> 0:06:55,000
where it's going.

136
0:06:56.434,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.

137
0:07:01.281,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourt

138
0:07:04.171,000 --> 0:07:08,000
at the University of Chicago organized an event,

139
0:07:08.446,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a conference on the idea of chance.

140
0:07:11.843,000 --> 0:07:13,000
He and I were together on the panel,

141
0:07:13.929,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and just before delivering our papers —

142
0:07:16.446,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we didn't know each other's papers —

143
0:07:18.796,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we decided to take chance seriously.

144
0:07:21.304,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So we informed our audience

145
0:07:23.14,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that what they will just now hear

146
0:07:25.489,000 --> 0:07:27,000
will be a random paper,

147
0:07:27.502,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a mixture of the two papers

148
0:07:29.674,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which we didn't know what each was writing.

149
0:07:33.545,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.

150
0:07:37.725,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Bernard read his first paragraph,

151
0:07:39.946,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I read my first paragraph,

152
0:07:42.07,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Bernard read his second paragraph,

153
0:07:44.277,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I read my second paragraph,

154
0:07:45.762,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in this way towards the end of our papers.

155
0:07:49.384,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, you will be surprised

156
0:07:51.263,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that a majority of our audience

157
0:07:53.445,000 --> 0:07:55,000
did not think that what they'd just listened to

158
0:07:56.188,000 --> 0:07:59,000
was a completely random paper.

159
0:07:59.473,000 --> 0:08:,000
They couldn't believe that

160
0:08:01.419,000 --> 0:08:03,000
speaking from the position of authority

161
0:08:03.939,000 --> 0:08:04,000
like two professors we were,

162
0:08:05.817,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we would take chance seriously.

163
0:08:08.888,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They thought we prepared the papers together

164
0:08:11.475,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and were just joking that it's random.

165
0:08:14.953,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, we live in times with a lot of information,

166
0:08:19.12,000 --> 0:08:2,000
big data,

167
0:08:20.711,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.

168
0:08:23.715,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We decoded our genome.

169
0:08:25.458,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We know about our brains more than before.

170
0:08:28.569,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But surprisingly, people are more and more

171
0:08:31.205,000 --> 0:08:35,000
turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.

172
0:08:35.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Ignorance and denial are on the rise.

173
0:08:40.633,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,

174
0:08:43.851,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we think that we will just wake up again

175
0:08:46.505,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and everything will be the same as before,

176
0:08:48.721,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and no political or social changes are needed.

177
0:08:51.984,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In regard to ecological crisis,

178
0:08:54.234,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we think nothing needs to be done just now,

179
0:08:57.35,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or others need to act before us.

180
0:09:00.252,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Or even when ecological crisis already happens,

181
0:09:03.548,000 --> 0:09:05,000
like a catastrophe in Fukushima,

182
0:09:05.877,000 --> 0:09:07,000
often we have people living in the same environment

183
0:09:08.701,000 --> 0:09:09,000
with the same amount of information,

184
0:09:10.523,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and half of them will be anxious about radiation

185
0:09:14.21,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and half of them will ignore it.

186
0:09:17.531,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, psychoanalysts know very well

187
0:09:20.343,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that people surprisingly don't have

188
0:09:22.818,000 --> 0:09:23,000
passion for knowledge

189
0:09:24.607,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but passion for ignorance.

190
0:09:27.689,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, what does that mean?

191
0:09:29.174,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Let's say when we are facing

192
0:09:30.99,000 --> 0:09:32,000
a life-threatening illness,

193
0:09:33.783,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a lot of people don't want to know that.

194
0:09:36.989,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They'd rather prefer denying the illness,

195
0:09:40.387,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is why it's not so wise to inform them

196
0:09:43.661,000 --> 0:09:44,000
if they don't ask.

197
0:09:45.37,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Surprisingly, research shows that sometimes

198
0:09:47.8,000 --> 0:09:48,000
people who deny their illness

199
0:09:49.644,000 --> 0:09:52,000
live longer than those who are rationally choosing

200
0:09:53.56,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the best treatment.

201
0:09:55.999,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, this ignorance, however,

202
0:09:58.12,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is not very helpful on the level of the social.

203
0:10:02.849,000 --> 0:10:05,000
When we are ignorant about where we are heading,

204
0:10:06.179,000 --> 0:10:1,000
a lot of social damage can be caused.

205
0:10:10.364,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now, on top of facing ignorance,

206
0:10:12.445,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we are also facing today

207
0:10:14.683,000 --> 0:10:17,000
some kind of an obviousness.

208
0:10:17.844,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, it was French philosopher

209
0:10:19.971,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Louis Althusser who pointed out

210
0:10:22.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that ideology functions in such a way

211
0:10:24.643,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that it creates a veil of obviousness.

212
0:10:28.509,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Before we do any social critique,

213
0:10:32.244,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness

214
0:10:36.631,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and to think through a little bit differently.

215
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If we go back to this ideology

216
0:10:41.997,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of individual, rational choice

217
0:10:44.528,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we often embrace,

218
0:10:46.856,000 --> 0:10:47,000
it's necessary precisely here

219
0:10:48.836,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to lift this obviousness

220
0:10:51.165,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and to think a little bit differently.

221
0:10:54.296,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now for me, a question often is

222
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man

223
0:11:01.863,000 --> 0:11:04,000
on which capitalism relied from its beginning?

224
0:11:05.395,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Why do we think that we are really such masters

225
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of our lives that we can rationally

226
0:11:10.705,000 --> 0:11:12,000
make the best ideal choices,

227
0:11:13.157,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we don't accept losses and risks?

228
0:11:16.386,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And for me, it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people,

229
0:11:19.671,000 --> 0:11:21,000
for example, not supporting the idea

230
0:11:22.015,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of the rich being taxed more.

231
0:11:25.633,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Quite often here they still identify

232
0:11:27.681,000 --> 0:11:29,000
with a certain kind of a lottery mentality.

233
0:11:30.279,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it

234
0:11:33.562,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in the future, but maybe they think,

235
0:11:34.964,000 --> 0:11:37,000
my son might become the next Bill Gates.

236
0:11:38.153,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And who would want to tax one's son?

237
0:11:41.37,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Or, a question for me is also,

238
0:11:45.2,000 --> 0:11:47,000
why would people who have no health insurance

239
0:11:47.58,000 --> 0:11:49,000
not embrace universal healthcare?

240
0:11:50.561,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Sometimes they don't embrace it,

241
0:11:52.09,000 --> 0:11:54,000
again identifying with the idea of choice,

242
0:11:54.914,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but they have nothing to choose from.

243
0:11:57.472,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said

244
0:12:01.922,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that there is nothing like a society.

245
0:12:04.554,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Society doesn't exist, it is only individuals

246
0:12:08.334,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and their families.

247
0:12:10.13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,

248
0:12:15.263,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which is why people who are poor might feel

249
0:12:17.547,000 --> 0:12:18,000
ashamed for their poverty.

250
0:12:19.47,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We might endlessly feel guilty that we are

251
0:12:21.732,000 --> 0:12:23,000
not making the right choices,

252
0:12:23.846,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and that's why we didn't succeed.

253
0:12:26.142,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We are anxious that we are not good enough.

254
0:12:29.674,000 --> 0:12:3,000
That's why we work very hard,

255
0:12:31.597,000 --> 0:12:32,000
long hours at the workplace

256
0:12:33.138,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and equally long hours on remaking ourselves.

257
0:12:37.576,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now, when we are anxious over choices,

258
0:12:39.989,000 --> 0:12:43,000
sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.

259
0:12:44.421,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We identify with the guru

260
0:12:46.217,000 --> 0:12:47,000
who tells us what to do,

261
0:12:47.496,000 --> 0:12:49,000
self-help therapist,

262
0:12:50.14,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or we embrace a totalitarian leader

263
0:12:52.919,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who appears to have no doubts about choices,

264
0:12:55.706,000 --> 0:12:57,000
who sort of knows.

265
0:12:57.79,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Now, often people ask me,

266
0:13:00.566,000 --> 0:13:02,000
"What did you learn by studying choice?"

267
0:13:02.94,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And there is an important message that I did learn.

268
0:13:06.111,000 --> 0:13:08,000
When thinking about choices,

269
0:13:08.598,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.

270
0:13:13.558,000 --> 0:13:15,000
First, I realized a lot of choice I make

271
0:13:16.18,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is not rational.

272
0:13:17.639,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It's linked to my unconscious,

273
0:13:19.543,000 --> 0:13:21,000
my guesses of what others are choosing,

274
0:13:21.737,000 --> 0:13:24,000
or what is a socially embraced choice.

275
0:13:25.393,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I also embrace the idea

276
0:13:27.69,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that we should go beyond

277
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
thinking about individual choices,

278
0:13:31.254,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that it's very important to rethink social choices,

279
0:13:34.91,000 --> 0:13:37,000
since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us.

280
0:13:38.611,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It really prevented us to think about social change.

281
0:13:41.749,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We spend so much time choosing things for ourselves

282
0:13:45.48,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and barely reflect on

283
0:13:47.25,000 --> 0:13:49,000
communal choices we can make.

284
0:13:49.476,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Now, we should not forget that choice

285
0:13:51.176,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is always linked to change.

286
0:13:53.86,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We can make individual changes,

287
0:13:55.676,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but we can make social changes.

288
0:13:57.861,000 --> 0:14:,000
We can choose to have more wolves.

289
0:14:01.627,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We can choose to change our environment

290
0:14:04.394,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to have more bees.

291
0:14:06.824,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We can choose to have different rating agencies.

292
0:14:11.11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We can choose to control corporations

293
0:14:13.573,000 --> 0:14:16,000
instead of allowing corporations to control us.

294
0:14:17.437,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We have a possibility to make changes.

295
0:14:20.852,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,

296
0:14:24.13,000 --> 0:14:26,000
who said that when we make choice in life,

297
0:14:26.859,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we shouldn't forget to live.

298
0:14:29.446,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Finally, you can see

299
0:14:31.673,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I did have a choice

300
0:14:33.18,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to choose one of the three quotes

301
0:14:34.467,000 --> 0:14:38,000
with which I wanted to start my lecture.

302
0:14:38.491,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I did have a choice,

303
0:14:40.39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
such as nations, as people,

304
0:14:42.698,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we have choices too to rethink

305
0:14:44.97,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in what kind of society we want to live in the future.

306
0:14:48.282,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thank you.

307
0:14:50.333,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

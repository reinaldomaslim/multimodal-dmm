1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which I did across the North Pole.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And while that swim took place three years ago,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I can remember it as if it was yesterday.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I remember standing on the edge of the ice,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about to dive into the water,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and thinking to myself, I have never ever

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
seen any place on this earth

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is just so frightening.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The water is completely black.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's flipping freezing in that water.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And then a thought came across my mind:

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
if things go pear-shaped on this swim,

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how long will it take for my frozen body

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
to sink the four and a half kilometers

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to the bottom of the ocean?

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
out of my mind as quickly as possible.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And the only way I can dive

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
into that freezing cold water

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and swim a kilometer

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
listening to everything from beautiful opera

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
all the way across to Puff Daddy,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and then committing myself a hundred percent --

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and then walking up to the edge of the ice

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and just diving into the water.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And that swim took me

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
18 minutes and 50 seconds,

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and it felt like 18 days.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I remember getting out of the water

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and my hands feeling so painful

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and looking down at my fingers,

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and my fingers were literally the size of sausages

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because -- you know, we're made partially of water --

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
when water freezes it expands,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and so the cells in my fingers

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
had frozen and expanded

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and burst.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
was the following:

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm never, ever

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
going to do another cold water swim

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in my life again.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the melting of the -- (Laughter)

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the melting of the glaciers

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because of climate change.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because of the melting of the glacier.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and left in its place this big lake.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I firmly believe

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that what we're seeing in the Himalayas

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is the next great, big battleground

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
on this earth.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Nearly two billion people --

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so one in three people on this earth --

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
rely on the water from the Himalayas.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and with the water supply from these glaciers --

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because of climate change --

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
decreasing so much,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I think we have a real risk of instability.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
all these countries.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And so I decided

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to walk up to Mt. Everest,

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the highest mountain on this earth,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and go and do a symbolic swim

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
underneath the summit

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of Mt. Everest.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
28 great, big, powerful yaks

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I don't just have my Speedo,

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but there's a big film crew who then

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
send all the images around the world.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is not just the altitude.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So it's right up in the heavens.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
just hitting your head all the time.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's not the worst part of it.

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and this was the year they decided to go

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and then bring them down the mountain.

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And when you're walking up the mountain

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to attempt to do something

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish --

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
When you're trying to do that,

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then the bodies are coming past you,

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it humbles you,

105
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and you also realize very, very clearly

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that nature is so much more powerful

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
than we are.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we walked up this pathway,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
all the way up.

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And to the right hand side of us

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was this great Khumbu Glacier.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And all the way along the glacier we saw

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
these big pools of melting ice.

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then we got up to this small lake

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I prepared myself

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the same way as I've always prepared myself,

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I got myself as aggressive as possible --

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but controlled aggression --

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and then I hurled myself

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
into that water.

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I swam as quickly as I could

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
for the first hundred meters,

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and then I realized very, very quickly,

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I had a huge problem on my hands.

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I could barely breathe.

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I was gasping for air.

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I then began to choke,

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.

132
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And it all happened so quickly:

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.

134
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And luckily, the water was quite shallow,

135
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and get up and then take another gasp of air.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I carried on for another five or six strokes,

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then I had nothing in my body,

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I went down to the bottom of the lake.

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I don't where I got it from,

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but I was able to somehow

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
pull myself up and as quickly as possible

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
get to the side of the lake.

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
I've heard it said that drowning

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is the most peaceful death that you can have.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I have never, ever heard

148
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
such utter bollocks.

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that you can have.

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I got myself to the side of the lake.

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
My crew grabbed me,

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and then we walked as quickly as we could

155
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
down -- over the rubble --

156
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
down to our camp.

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And there, we sat down,

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
there on Mt. Everest.

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And my team just gave it to me straight.

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
They said, Lewis, you need to have

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a radical tactical shift

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
if you want to do this swim.

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Every single thing which you have learned

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the past 23 years of swimming,

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you must forget.

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Every single thing which you learned

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
when you were serving in the British army,

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
about speed and aggression,

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you put that to one side.

171
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Take some time to rest and think about things.

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and instead of swimming fast,

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
swim as slowly as possible.

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This is the time to swim

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with real humility.

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And so we walked back up

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to the mountain two days later.

182
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And I stood there

183
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
on the edge of the lake,

184
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I looked up at Mt. Everest --

185
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --

186
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and I said to myself, just do this slowly.

187
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I swam across the lake.

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I can't begin to tell you

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
how good I felt

190
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when I came to the other side.

191
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But I learned two very, very

192
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
important lessons there on Mt. Everest,

193
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.

194
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The first one is

195
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that just because something has worked in the past so well,

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And similarly,

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
now, before I do anything,

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I ask myself what type of mindset

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
do I require

201
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to successfully complete a task.

202
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And taking that into the world of climate change --

203
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
which is, frankly,

204
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the Mt. Everest of all problems --

205
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,

206
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
just because we have consumed the way we have for so long

207
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and populated the earth the way we have for so long,

208
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
doesn't mean that we can carry on

209
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the way we are carrying on.

210
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The warning signs are all there.

211
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
When I was born, the world's population

212
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
was 3.5 billion people.

213
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We're now 6.8 billion people,

214
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and we're expected to be 9 billion people

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
by 2050.

216
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And then the second lesson,

217
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the radical, tactical shift.

218
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I've come here to ask you today:

219
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
what radical tactical shift

220
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
can you take in your relationship to the environment,

221
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
which will ensure

222
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that our children and our grandchildren

223
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
live in a safe world

224
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and a secure world,

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and most importantly, in a sustainable world?

226
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And I ask you, please, to go away from here

227
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and think about that one

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
radical tactical shift

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
which you could make,

230
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which will make that big difference,

231
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.

232
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,

233
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and commit a hundred percent,

234
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because very, very few things

235
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
are impossible to achieve

236
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
if we really put our whole minds to it.

237
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So thank you very, very much.

238
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Another is to change our lifestyles.

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
can actually be measured now.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This was figured out by Robin Williams

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a few years before the rest of us.

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, there's some things that you can do

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to make your brain grow new brain cells.

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
alcohol in moderation, stress management

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.

18
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm just the messenger.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What were we just talking about?

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And other things that can make it worse,

23
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that can cause you to lose brain cells.

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,

25
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,

27
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Your heart gets more blood flow.

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.

30
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
after only a year become measurably less clogged.

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the blue means no blood flow.

34
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,

37
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
simply by making these changes.

38
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited

39
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
70 percent in the group that made these changes,

40
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.

41
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
These differences were highly significant.

42
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,

43
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so you increase sexual potency.

44
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done

45
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
by the Department of Health Services,

46
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,

47
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,

48
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but it also causes impotence.

49
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.

50
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
How sexy is that?

51
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now we're also about to publish a study --

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.

53
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is what's called a heat map --

54
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.

55
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --

56
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,

57
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
turning off the disease-promoting genes.

58
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And so these findings I think are really very powerful,

59
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
giving many people new hope and new choices.

60
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,

61
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that are giving you your genetic profiles,

62
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"

63
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --

64
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes

65
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
than we might have made otherwise,

66
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.

67
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Thank you.

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Applause)

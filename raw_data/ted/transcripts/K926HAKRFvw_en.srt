1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is Pleurobot.

2
0:00:15.4,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species

3
0:00:19.04,000 --> 0:00:2,000
called Pleurodeles waltl.

4
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,

5
0:00:23.52,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and as you'll see later, it can also swim.

6
0:00:26.28,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So you might ask, why did we design this robot?

7
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.

8
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists

9
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to understand how animals move,

10
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.

11
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But the more I work in biorobotics,

12
0:00:43.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.

13
0:00:45.92,000 --> 0:00:49,000
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around,

14
0:00:50.24,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or even us as humans,

15
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when you go jogging or play tennis,

16
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:54,000
we do amazing things.

17
0:00:55.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.

18
0:01:00.04,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly,

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.

20
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And my goal is to understand how this works.

21
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There are four main components behind animal locomotion.

22
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The first component is just the body,

23
0:01:16.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and in fact we should never underestimate

24
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.

25
0:01:22.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Then you have the spinal cord,

26
0:01:24.4,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,

27
0:01:26.4,000 --> 0:01:29,000
multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop

28
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.

29
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
A third component are central pattern generators.

30
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals

31
0:01:40.92,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that can generate, by themselves,

32
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity

33
0:01:45.32,000 --> 0:01:47,000
while receiving only very simple input signals.

34
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And these input signals

35
0:01:48.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain,

36
0:01:52.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,

37
0:01:54.76,000 --> 0:01:56,000
will all modulate activity of the spinal cord

38
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:01:57,000
while we do locomotion.

39
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component,

40
0:02:01.64,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the spinal cord, together with the body,

41
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:05,000
already solve a big part of the locomotion problem.

42
0:02:06.08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken,

43
0:02:09.532,000 --> 0:02:1,000
it can still run for a while,

44
0:02:10.937,000 --> 0:02:12,000
showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body,

45
0:02:13.5,000 --> 0:02:14,000
already solve a big part of locomotion.

46
0:02:15.397,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, understanding how this works is very complex,

47
0:02:17.88,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because first of all,

48
0:02:19.2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.

49
0:02:21.844,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex

50
0:02:24.64,000 --> 0:02:27,000
than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.

51
0:02:27.72,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Especially in humans, very hard to do.

52
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:32,000
A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex

53
0:02:33.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and very dynamic interaction between these four components.

54
0:02:36.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.

55
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models

56
0:02:44.64,000 --> 0:02:45,000
can really help.

57
0:02:47.48,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So what's biorobotics?

58
0:02:48.76,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics

59
0:02:51.52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where people want to take inspiration from animals

60
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to make robots to go outdoors,

61
0:02:56.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
like service robots or search and rescue robots

62
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
or field robots.

63
0:03:00.88,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals

64
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to make robots that can handle complex terrain --

65
0:03:05.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
stairs, mountains, forests,

66
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:09,000
places where robots still have difficulties

67
0:03:09.64,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and where animals can do a much better job.

68
0:03:11.72,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.

69
0:03:14.24,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There are some very nice projects where robots are used,

70
0:03:16.884,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.

71
0:03:20.88,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.

72
0:03:23.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists

73
0:03:26.56,000 --> 0:03:29,000
like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,

74
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.

75
0:03:34.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And here we want to start simple.

76
0:03:36.12,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So it's good to start with simple animals

77
0:03:38.12,000 --> 0:03:4,000
like lampreys, which are very primitive fish,

78
0:03:40.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion,

79
0:03:42.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
like in salamanders,

80
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but also in cats and in humans,

81
0:03:45.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in mammals.

82
0:03:47.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool

83
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to validate our models.

84
0:03:52.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.

85
0:03:55.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer

86
0:03:58.56,000 --> 0:04:,000
making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion

87
0:04:01.24,000 --> 0:04:02,000
during my PhD.

88
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.

89
0:04:06.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground,

90
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.

91
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Why not have a real robot and real physics?

92
0:04:15.6,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.

93
0:04:18.76,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian,

94
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.

95
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It makes a wonderful link between swimming,

96
0:04:27.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as you find it in eels or fish,

97
0:04:29.12,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.

98
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And in fact, the modern salamander

99
0:04:35.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate,

100
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so it's almost a living fossil,

101
0:04:39.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which gives us access to our ancestor,

102
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.

103
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So the salamander swims

104
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait,

105
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.

106
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And if you place the salamander on the ground,

107
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.

108
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs

109
0:05:00.887,000 --> 0:05:01,000
which are very nicely coordinated

110
0:05:02.52,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with this standing wave undulation of the body,

111
0:05:05.2,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.

112
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact

113
0:05:11.88,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.

114
0:05:16.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So if you take a decerebrated salamander --

115
0:05:18.064,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it's not so nice but you remove the head --

116
0:05:20.104,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord,

117
0:05:22.8,000 --> 0:05:25,000
at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.

118
0:05:26.08,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.

119
0:05:28.56,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And at some point, there's a threshold,

120
0:05:30.48,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and automatically, the animal switches to swimming.

121
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This is amazing.

122
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Just changing the global drive,

123
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as if you are pressing the gas pedal

124
0:05:37.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of descending modulation to your spinal cord,

125
0:05:39.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
makes a complete switch between two very different gaits.

126
0:05:44.44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And in fact, the same has been observed in cats.

127
0:05:47.04,000 --> 0:05:49,000
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,

128
0:05:49.08,000 --> 0:05:51,000
you can switch between walk, trot and gallop.

129
0:05:51.32,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking,

130
0:05:54.08,000 --> 0:05:55,000
at a low level of stimulation,

131
0:05:55.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.

132
0:05:58.4,000 --> 0:06:,000
And this really shows that the spinal cord

133
0:06:00.44,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.

134
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail,

135
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine

136
0:06:08.48,000 --> 0:06:11,000
from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.

137
0:06:12.08,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine

138
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to record all the bone motion in great detail.

139
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's what we did.

140
0:06:18.44,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So we basically figured out which bones are important for us

141
0:06:21.64,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and collected their motion in 3D.

142
0:06:24.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And what we did is collect a whole database of motions,

143
0:06:27.4,000 --> 0:06:28,000
both on ground and in water,

144
0:06:29.08,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors

145
0:06:31.589,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that a real animal can do.

146
0:06:32.858,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.

147
0:06:36.033,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure,

148
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
where to place the motors, how to connect them together,

149
0:06:42.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to be able to replay these motions as well as possible.

150
0:06:45.68,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.

151
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal.

152
0:06:52.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So what you see here is almost a direct comparison

153
0:06:55.48,000 --> 0:06:57,000
between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.

154
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:07:,000
You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay

155
0:07:00.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of the walking gait.

156
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.

157
0:07:07.52,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But even better, we can do swimming.

158
0:07:09.92,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --

159
0:07:12.96,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:14.08,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.

161
0:07:17.28,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.

162
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The physics of interaction are complex.

163
0:07:22.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Our robot is much bigger than a small animal,

164
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies

165
0:07:28.4,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to make sure we had the same interaction physics.

166
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But you see at the end, we have a very close match,

167
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and we were very, very happy with this.

168
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So let's go to the spinal cord.

169
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen

170
0:07:40.04,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is model the spinal cord circuits.

171
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And what's interesting is that the salamander

172
0:07:45.2,000 --> 0:07:46,000
has kept a very primitive circuit,

173
0:07:46.844,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey,

174
0:07:49.52,000 --> 0:07:5,000
this primitive eel-like fish,

175
0:07:51.52,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and it looks like during evolution,

176
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:55,000
new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs,

177
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to do the leg locomotion.

178
0:07:57.68,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we know where these neural oscillators are

179
0:07:59.88,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but what we did was to make a mathematical model

180
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to see how they should be coupled

181
0:08:03.8,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to allow this transition between the two very different gaits.

182
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And we tested that on board of a robot.

183
0:08:09.68,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And this is how it looks.

184
0:08:18.92,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot

185
0:08:21.96,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model

186
0:08:25.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
programmed on board of the robot.

187
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And the only thing we do

188
0:08:28.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is send to the robot through a remote control

189
0:08:30.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the two descending signals it normally should receive

190
0:08:33.24,000 --> 0:08:34,000
from the upper part of the brain.

191
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals,

192
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.

193
0:08:41.6,000 --> 0:08:42,000
For instance,

194
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:45,000
when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait,

195
0:08:46.44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,

196
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.

197
0:08:51.48,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely

198
0:08:53.72,000 --> 0:08:56,000
by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.

199
0:08:58.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I think it's really beautiful

200
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
how nature has distributed control

201
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord

202
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.

203
0:09:08.68,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It just has to worry about this high-level modulation,

204
0:09:11.24,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.

205
0:09:14.84,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.

206
0:09:19.08,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So this is another project

207
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:22,000
where we studied cat biomechanics,

208
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.

209
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And we found three important criteria in the properties,

210
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:31,000
basically, of the limbs.

211
0:09:32.32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The first one is that a cat limb

212
0:09:34.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.

213
0:09:37.04,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure

214
0:09:39.28,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.

215
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit

216
0:09:46.72,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the internal movement of the segments.

217
0:09:48.56,000 --> 0:09:51,000
A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.

218
0:09:51.64,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Most of the muscles are in the trunk,

219
0:09:53.52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia

220
0:09:56.44,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and can be moved very rapidly.

221
0:09:58.24,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb,

222
0:10:02.08,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so to handle impacts and forces.

223
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.

224
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.

225
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot,

226
0:10:17.84,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and as you see, it's a cute little robot.

227
0:10:19.92,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It looks a bit like a toy,

228
0:10:21.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but it was really used as a scientific tool

229
0:10:23.28,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.

230
0:10:26.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight,

231
0:10:29.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and also very elastic,

232
0:10:30.52,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so you can easily press it down and it will not break.

233
0:10:33.32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It will just jump, in fact.

234
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And this very elastic property is also very important.

235
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And you also see a bit these properties

236
0:10:41.08,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.

237
0:10:44.28,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait

238
0:10:47.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is obtained purely in open loop,

239
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.

240
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And that's interesting, because it means

241
0:10:54.6,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait,

242
0:10:58.64,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.

243
0:11:02.84,000 --> 0:11:05,000
To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion,

244
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
as you will see in the next video,

245
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:1,000
where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step,

246
0:11:11.76,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the robot will not fall over,

247
0:11:13.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which was a surprise for us.

248
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This is a small perturbation.

249
0:11:16.44,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over,

250
0:11:18.88,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.

251
0:11:21.34,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait,

252
0:11:23.56,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the robot doesn't fall over.

253
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles,

254
0:11:28.32,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.

255
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But what's important here is that just for small perturbation,

256
0:11:34.96,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the mechanics are right.

257
0:11:36.48,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And I think this is a very important message

258
0:11:38.6,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience,

259
0:11:40.815,000 --> 0:11:44,000
saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.

260
0:11:47.44,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion?

261
0:11:49.96,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion,

262
0:11:54.36,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar

263
0:11:57.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to that of other vertebrates.

264
0:11:59.12,000 --> 0:12:,000
And especially the spinal cord

265
0:12:00.6,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is also the key controller for locomotion in humans.

266
0:12:03.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord,

267
0:12:06.2,000 --> 0:12:07,000
this has dramatic effects.

268
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.

269
0:12:10.52,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is because the brain loses this communication

270
0:12:12.92,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with the spinal cord.

271
0:12:14.2,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Especially, it loses this descending modulation

272
0:12:16.44,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to initiate and modulate locomotion.

273
0:12:19.64,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics

274
0:12:21.36,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is to be able to reactivate that communication

275
0:12:23.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
using electrical or chemical stimulations.

276
0:12:26.84,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that,

277
0:12:29.8,000 --> 0:12:3,000
especially at EPFL.

278
0:12:31.04,000 --> 0:12:33,000
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera,

279
0:12:33.56,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with whom I collaborate.

280
0:12:35.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand

281
0:12:39.08,000 --> 0:12:4,000
how the spinal cord works,

282
0:12:40.84,000 --> 0:12:41,000
how it interacts with the body,

283
0:12:42.56,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.

284
0:12:45.8,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This is where the robots and models that I've presented today

285
0:12:48.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
will hopefully play a key role

286
0:12:50.64,000 --> 0:12:52,000
towards these very important goals.

287
0:12:53.32,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you.

288
0:12:54.56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

289
0:13:04.1,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots

290
0:13:06.76,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that do things like swim in pollution

291
0:13:09.24,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and measure the pollution while they swim.

292
0:13:11.72,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But for this one,

293
0:13:12.96,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you mentioned in your talk, like a side project,

294
0:13:17.64,000 --> 0:13:18,000
search and rescue,

295
0:13:18.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and it does have a camera on its nose.

296
0:13:21.08,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --

297
0:13:23.6,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We have some spin-off projects

298
0:13:25.053,000 --> 0:13:28,000
where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection,

299
0:13:28.52,000 --> 0:13:29,000
so this robot is now seeing you.

300
0:13:30.12,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation

301
0:13:33.32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded,

302
0:13:36.96,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,

303
0:13:40.32,000 --> 0:13:42,000
why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk,

304
0:13:43.24,000 --> 0:13:46,000
with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors

305
0:13:46.44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.

306
0:13:49.24,000 --> 0:13:52,000
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.

307
0:13:52.84,000 --> 0:13:55,000
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit,

308
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack

309
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
just of being worried that this would feed on you.

310
0:14:01.56,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust,

311
0:14:04.44,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.

312
0:14:06.52,000 --> 0:14:08,000
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.

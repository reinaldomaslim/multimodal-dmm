0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There was a time when simple infections were deadly,

3
0:00:15.857,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but now, thanks to the wide availability of antibiotics,

4
0:00:19.317,000 --> 0:00:21,000
this is merely a relic of the past.

5
0:00:22.03,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But actually, I should say "was,"

6
0:00:24.284,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because nowadays, we're using antibiotics so much

7
0:00:28.466,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that the bacteria that cause these infections

8
0:00:30.904,000 --> 0:00:31,000
are becoming resistant.

9
0:00:32.521,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that should really scare the hell out of all of us.

10
0:00:36.125,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If we do not change our behavior and wean ourselves off antibiotics,

11
0:00:40.363,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the UN predicts that by 2050,

12
0:00:43.728,000 --> 0:00:47,000
antimicrobial resistance will become our single biggest killer.

13
0:00:48.887,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So we must start to act.

14
0:00:51.681,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But "where to begin" is an interesting question,

15
0:00:54.022,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because we humans are not the only ones using antibiotics.

16
0:00:57.275,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Worldwide, 50 to 80 percent of all antibiotics are used by animals.

17
0:01:02.863,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Not all of these are critical for human health,

18
0:01:05.45,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but if we do not get it under control right now,

19
0:01:07.966,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we're looking at a very scary future for humans and animals alike.

20
0:01:12.809,000 --> 0:01:15,000
To begin, let's talk about how we ended up here.

21
0:01:16.205,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The first large-scale use of antibiotics was in the early '50s of the last century.

22
0:01:21.863,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In the Western world, prosperity was increasing

23
0:01:24.625,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and people wanted to eat more animal protein.

24
0:01:27.831,000 --> 0:01:3,000
When animals were sick, you could now treat them with antibiotics

25
0:01:30.919,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so they did not die and kept growing.

26
0:01:32.99,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But soon, it was discovered

27
0:01:34.411,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that adding small and regular amounts of antibiotics to the feed

28
0:01:37.728,000 --> 0:01:38,000
kept the animals healthy,

29
0:01:39.236,000 --> 0:01:4,000
made them grow faster

30
0:01:41.085,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and caused them to need less feed.

31
0:01:43.061,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So these antibiotics worked well --

32
0:01:45.347,000 --> 0:01:46,000
really well, actually.

33
0:01:47.045,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And with increasing animal production,

34
0:01:49.387,000 --> 0:01:52,000
also antibiotic use skyrocketed worldwide.

35
0:01:53.034,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Unfortunately, so did antibiotic resistance.

36
0:01:57.066,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The reason your doctor tells you to finish the entire bottle of antibiotics

37
0:02:01.423,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is if you shorten your dose, you will not kill all of the bugs.

38
0:02:05.082,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the ones that stick around build up the antibiotic resistance.

39
0:02:09.923,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's the same problem with giving animals small and regular doses of antibiotics:

40
0:02:14.157,000 --> 0:02:16,000
some bad bugs die but not all of them.

41
0:02:16.863,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Spread that across an entire industry,

42
0:02:19.3,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you can understand that we accidentally build up

43
0:02:21.792,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a large reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

44
0:02:27.006,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But I hate to break it to you --

45
0:02:28.584,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the problem doesn't stop there.

46
0:02:30.998,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You know who else takes antibiotics?

47
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Fluffy, your cat, and Rover, your dog.

48
0:02:35.945,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:37.088,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Pets rank even amongst the heaviest users of all,

50
0:02:40.439,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and they use antibiotics

51
0:02:41.856,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that are much more critical for human health.

52
0:02:44.709,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Combine this with how close we live with our companion animals

53
0:02:48.855,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and you understand the risk

54
0:02:50.601,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of you picking up antibiotic-resistant bacteria from your own pet.

55
0:02:57.141,000 --> 0:03:,000
But how do these antibiotic-resistant bacteria

56
0:03:00.177,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in farm animals affect you?

57
0:03:02.133,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Let me give you an example we have, actually, data on.

58
0:03:05.6,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The levels of antibiotic-resistant salmonella in pigs in Europe

59
0:03:10.124,000 --> 0:03:12,000
against different types of antibiotics

60
0:03:12.569,000 --> 0:03:15,000
range from less than a percent to as high [as] 60 percent.

61
0:03:16.728,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Which means that in most cases,

62
0:03:18.649,000 --> 0:03:21,000
this antibiotic will not work anymore to kill this salmonella.

63
0:03:23.228,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And there was a high correlation

64
0:03:25.188,000 --> 0:03:27,000
between antibiotic-resistant salmonella in the pig

65
0:03:28.133,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and in the final product.

66
0:03:29.895,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Whether that is pork chop,

67
0:03:31.831,000 --> 0:03:32,000
spare ribs or minced meat.

68
0:03:33.95,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, luckily, typically less than one percent

69
0:03:37.412,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of all raw meat, fish or eggs

70
0:03:39.935,000 --> 0:03:4,000
will contain salmonella.

71
0:03:41.847,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this only poses a risk when not treated well.

72
0:03:45.53,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Still, there are over 100,000 human salmonella cases in the EU

73
0:03:50.219,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and more than a million cases in the US.

74
0:03:53.822,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In the US, leading to 23,000 hospitalizations

75
0:03:57.131,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and 450 people dead each year.

76
0:04:01.201,000 --> 0:04:03,000
With antibiotic-resistant salmonella on the rise,

77
0:04:03.535,000 --> 0:04:05,000
this death toll is likely to increase.

78
0:04:07.416,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But it's not only about consuming yourself.

79
0:04:10.053,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This year, more than 100 people got infected

80
0:04:12.855,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with a multidrug-resistant salmonella

81
0:04:15.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
after feeding pig ears, as a treat, to their dog.

82
0:04:19.915,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So we really must cut back on antibiotic use in animal production.

83
0:04:23.947,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And luckily, this is starting to happen.

84
0:04:26.534,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The EU was the first region to ban

85
0:04:29.125,000 --> 0:04:31,000
putting antibiotics in low doses in the feed.

86
0:04:32.022,000 --> 0:04:34,000
From '99 on, in several steps,

87
0:04:34.688,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the amount of different types of antibiotics allowed was reduced,

88
0:04:37.787,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and in 2006, a complete ban went into place.

89
0:04:41.089,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Antibiotics were only allowed

90
0:04:42.795,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when a veterinarian determined the animal was sick.

91
0:04:46.168,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Sounds great, right?

92
0:04:47.351,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Problem solved.

93
0:04:48.545,000 --> 0:04:49,000
No, wait, not so fast.

94
0:04:50.625,000 --> 0:04:52,000
As soon as the reduction program started,

95
0:04:53.244,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it was very quickly discovered

96
0:04:55.276,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that antibiotics had been the perfect blanket

97
0:04:57.657,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to cover up a lot of bad farm practices.

98
0:05:00.276,000 --> 0:05:01,000
More and more animals became sick

99
0:05:02.228,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and needed to be cured with ... antibiotics.

100
0:05:05.347,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So instead of the total amount going down,

101
0:05:07.815,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it actually increased.

102
0:05:09.879,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Surely, that was not the way to go.

103
0:05:12.18,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But luckily, that was not the end of the story.

104
0:05:14.902,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The whole European agricultural sector started on a journey,

105
0:05:18.219,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I think it's a journey anybody can learn from.

106
0:05:21.878,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is also the time I personally entered the scene.

107
0:05:24.426,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I joined a large European feed compounder.

108
0:05:27.184,000 --> 0:05:31,000
A feed compounder makes a total diet for a farmer to feed to his animals

109
0:05:31.831,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and often also provides the advice

110
0:05:33.795,000 --> 0:05:35,000
on how to raise the animals in the best way.

111
0:05:36.657,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I was really motivated to work together with my colleagues,

112
0:05:39.475,000 --> 0:05:41,000
veterinarians and, of course, the farmers

113
0:05:41.879,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to figure out how to keep the animals healthy and antibiotic-free.

114
0:05:46.212,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now there are three major things that need to happen

115
0:05:48.736,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for antibiotic-free production.

116
0:05:50.411,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Let me walk you through the playbook.

117
0:05:52.386,000 --> 0:05:54,000
To start -- and it sounds very obvious --

118
0:05:54.871,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that our hygiene is the place to start.

119
0:05:57.212,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Better cleaning of the stable and the drinking-water lines

120
0:05:59.966,000 --> 0:06:02,000
making it harder for the disease to come in and spread across the stable.

121
0:06:04.419,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That's all very important,

122
0:06:05.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but the part I was personally most interested in

123
0:06:08.419,000 --> 0:06:09,000
was better feeding for the animals,

124
0:06:10.157,000 --> 0:06:11,000
better nutrition.

125
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Feeding a well-balanced diet is important.

126
0:06:14.252,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Think about it this way:

127
0:06:15.435,000 --> 0:06:18,000
when you yourself do not eat enough fiber, you do not feel well.

128
0:06:19.061,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Part of the food you consume is not digested by yourself

129
0:06:22.125,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but fermented in your large intestine by bacteria.

130
0:06:25.379,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So you're feeding those microbes with part of your diet.

131
0:06:29.768,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Initially, most young animals were fed low-fiber,

132
0:06:33.395,000 --> 0:06:34,000
high-starch and protein,

133
0:06:35.228,000 --> 0:06:37,000
very finely ground and highly digestible diets.

134
0:06:39.041,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Like being yourself on a diet of hamburger buns,

135
0:06:41.874,000 --> 0:06:43,000
rice, waffles and protein bars.

136
0:06:45.342,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We changed this to a lower-protein,

137
0:06:48.736,000 --> 0:06:5,000
higher-fiber, coarser type of diet.

138
0:06:51.807,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Like being on a diet of whole grains, salad with meat or beans.

139
0:06:56.363,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This shifted the bacterial flora in the animals' guts

140
0:06:59.127,000 --> 0:07:,000
to the more beneficial ones

141
0:07:00.887,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and reduced the chance that pathogens would flourish.

142
0:07:04.457,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You might be surprised

143
0:07:05.711,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but not only diet composition, also diet structure plays a role.

144
0:07:09.203,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Simply the fact that the same diet is coarser

145
0:07:12.219,000 --> 0:07:14,000
will lead to a better-developed digestive tract,

146
0:07:14.56,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and thus, a healthier animal.

147
0:07:17.564,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But the best part was that farmers started to buy this actually, too.

148
0:07:22.136,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Unlike some other parts of the world,

149
0:07:24.11,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Western European farmers mainly still make their independent buying decisions:

150
0:07:28.252,000 --> 0:07:3,000
who to buy the feed from and sell their animals to.

151
0:07:31.149,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So what you're actually selling in the end

152
0:07:33.22,000 --> 0:07:35,000
reflects the actual local need of these farmers.

153
0:07:36.339,000 --> 0:07:37,000
For example,

154
0:07:37.522,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the protein content in piglet diets

155
0:07:39.228,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in countries that are much more vigilant in reducing antibiotics,

156
0:07:42.347,000 --> 0:07:44,000
like, for example, Germany and the Netherlands,

157
0:07:44.59,000 --> 0:07:46,000
were already 10 to 15 percent lower

158
0:07:46.958,000 --> 0:07:49,000
than in a country like the UK, which was slower to pick this up.

159
0:07:51.742,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But, like with better hygiene, better nutrition helps

160
0:07:55.123,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but will not totally prevent you from becoming sick.

161
0:07:58.044,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So more is needed.

162
0:07:59.76,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And that's why we turned to the microbiome.

163
0:08:02.831,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Making the water with the feed more acidic

164
0:08:05.03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
helps to create an environment

165
0:08:06.839,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that benefits the more beneficial bacteria

166
0:08:09.228,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and inhibits the pathogens.

167
0:08:11.514,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Like fermented food,

168
0:08:12.689,000 --> 0:08:14,000
whether it's yogurt, sauerkraut or salami,

169
0:08:15.59,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they'll all spoil less quickly, too.

170
0:08:19.018,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, with modern techniques,

171
0:08:20.836,000 --> 0:08:22,000
like the ones based on DNA testing,

172
0:08:23.439,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we can see that there are many more different microorganisms present.

173
0:08:27.165,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And this ecosystem, which we call the microbiome,

174
0:08:30.18,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is much more complex.

175
0:08:33.109,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Turns out there are about eight times more microorganisms in your gut

176
0:08:37.403,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as tissue cells in your body.

177
0:08:39.815,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And for animals, the impact is no less.

178
0:08:43.495,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So if we want to work without antibiotics in animal production,

179
0:08:46.606,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we have to make the animals much more robust.

180
0:08:49.614,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So that when a disease strikes,

181
0:08:51.511,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the animals are much more resilient.

182
0:08:53.92,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And this three-pronged nutribiosis approach

183
0:08:56.975,000 --> 0:08:59,000
involving the host, nutrition and the microbiome

184
0:09:00.499,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is the way to do it.

185
0:09:02.118,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now the practice of raising animals on an antibiotic-containing

186
0:09:06.101,000 --> 0:09:09,000
or antibiotic-use-provoking diet is a bit cheaper at farm level.

187
0:09:11.132,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But in the end, we are talking about a few percent at the consumer level.

188
0:09:14.934,000 --> 0:09:15,000
That's actually quite affordable

189
0:09:16.49,000 --> 0:09:19,000
for the middle- and high-income part of the world population.

190
0:09:19.657,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And a very small price to pay

191
0:09:21.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
when our own health or our loved ones' health is at stake.

192
0:09:25.965,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So what do you think, what direction do we take?

193
0:09:28.823,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Do we allow antimicrobial resistance to become our biggest killer,

194
0:09:33.284,000 --> 0:09:36,000
at huge financial and a special personal cost?

195
0:09:36.974,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Or do we, besides reducing human antibiotic consumption,

196
0:09:41.518,000 --> 0:09:44,000
truly start embracing antibiotic-free animal production?

197
0:09:45.371,000 --> 0:09:47,000
For me, the choice is very obvious.

198
0:09:48.085,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But to make this happen,

199
0:09:49.625,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we have to set reduction targets

200
0:09:51.323,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and make sure that they're followed all around the world.

201
0:09:54.458,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Because farmers compete with each other.

202
0:09:56.427,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And at a country level,

203
0:09:57.8,000 --> 0:09:58,000
trading block or the global market,

204
0:09:59.728,000 --> 0:10:,000
costs are very important.

205
0:10:01.577,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And also, we have to be realistic.

206
0:10:03.284,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Farmers need to have the possibilities

207
0:10:05.482,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to invest more in better management and better feed

208
0:10:08.696,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in order to achieve this reduction.

209
0:10:11.474,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And besides legal limits, the market can play a role,

210
0:10:14.551,000 --> 0:10:17,000
by offering antibiotic-reduced or antibiotic-free products.

211
0:10:19.038,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And with growing consumer awareness,

212
0:10:21.204,000 --> 0:10:23,000
these market forces will increase in power.

213
0:10:24.675,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now everything I've been talking about seems to be great for us.

214
0:10:27.984,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But what about the animals?

215
0:10:30.175,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Now, guess what, their lives get better, too.

216
0:10:32.5,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Better health, less stress, happier life.

217
0:10:35.839,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So now you know.

218
0:10:37.18,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We have the knowledge how to produce meat, eggs and milk

219
0:10:42.347,000 --> 0:10:45,000
without or with very low amounts of antibiotics,

220
0:10:45.759,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I'll argue it's a small price to pay

221
0:10:48.332,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to avoid a future in which bacterial infections

222
0:10:51.454,000 --> 0:10:53,000
again become our biggest killer.

223
0:10:53.905,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Thank you.

224
0:10:55.102,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

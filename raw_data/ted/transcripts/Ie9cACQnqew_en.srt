1
0:00:13.071,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I never planned to become a climate activist.

2
0:00:16.579,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But things have changed,

3
0:00:18.868,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and now, standing here as a climate activist,

4
0:00:21.952,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I ask you all to become one, too.

5
0:00:25.193,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Here's why,

6
0:00:26.714,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and most importantly, how.

7
0:00:30.821,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Ten years ago, when I was 13 years old,

8
0:00:34.336,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I first learned about the greenhouse effect.

9
0:00:37.887,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Back then, we spent 90 minutes on this issue,

10
0:00:41.729,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I remember finding it quite irritating

11
0:00:43.889,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that something so fundamental

12
0:00:46.13,000 --> 0:00:48,000
would be squeezed into a single geography lesson.

13
0:00:50.123,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Some of this irritation remained, so when I graduated from high school,

14
0:00:53.993,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I decided to study geography,

15
0:00:56.315,000 --> 0:01:,000
just to make sure I was on the right track with this whole climate change thing.

16
0:01:01.487,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And this is when everything changed.

17
0:01:05.492,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This was the first time I looked at the data,

18
0:01:07.714,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at the science behind the climate crisis,

19
0:01:10.881,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I couldn't believe what I was reading.

20
0:01:13.985,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Like many of you,

21
0:01:16.128,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I thought that the planet wasn't really in a good state.

22
0:01:20.562,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I had no idea that we are rushing into this self-made disaster

23
0:01:25.602,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in such a rapid pace.

24
0:01:28.636,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There was also the first time I understood what difference it makes

25
0:01:31.995,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when you consider the bigger picture.

26
0:01:34.173,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Take the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, for instance,

27
0:01:37.907,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the number one driver for global warming.

28
0:01:40.487,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Yes, this looks bad.

29
0:01:42.298,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This looks like we are on a pretty bad track.

30
0:01:46.362,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But it's only once you don't just consider the last 60 years

31
0:01:49.609,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but the last 10,000 years

32
0:01:51.247,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that you understand how terrifying this really is.

33
0:01:55.512,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And this is just one aspect of the crisis we're seeing.

34
0:01:59.922,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm not going to get into details here, but let me tell you so much:

35
0:02:04.546,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we are in a point of history

36
0:02:07.503,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that the most destructive force on the planet is humanity itself.

37
0:02:12.81,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We are in a point of history

38
0:02:15.248,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that no scientist could guarantee you that you will survive this.

39
0:02:20.547,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We are in a point of history

40
0:02:23.17,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that humanity is creating an environment

41
0:02:26.906,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that's not safe for humans anymore.

42
0:02:32.353,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Yeah, there I was,

43
0:02:34.878,000 --> 0:02:35,000
first year of geography,

44
0:02:36.238,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and felt pretty overwhelmed.

45
0:02:37.713,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But ...

46
0:02:39.329,000 --> 0:02:4,000
there was good news.

47
0:02:42.087,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The very same year I first learned about all this,

48
0:02:45.622,000 --> 0:02:48,000
leaders from across the globe came together in Paris

49
0:02:49.249,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to decide on the common target to limit global warming to below two degrees.

50
0:02:55.763,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Pictures went around the world,

51
0:02:57.4,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I was told that history was made that day.

52
0:03:00.949,000 --> 0:03:01,000
How relieving, right?

53
0:03:04.358,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Except ...

54
0:03:06.43,000 --> 0:03:09,000
something didn't quite work out about this.

55
0:03:11.314,000 --> 0:03:13,000
After this agreement was signed,

56
0:03:14.156,000 --> 0:03:16,000
things didn't really get better.

57
0:03:16.249,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Actually, they got much worse.

58
0:03:19.823,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Decision makers and industries, leaders and politicians,

59
0:03:23.891,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they went back to business as usual,

60
0:03:27.458,000 --> 0:03:3,000
exploiting our livelihoods like there is literally no tomorrow,

61
0:03:32.252,000 --> 0:03:35,000
building coal power plants again and again,

62
0:03:35.916,000 --> 0:03:37,000
even though we know that needs to stop,

63
0:03:38.491,000 --> 0:03:4,000
according to the Paris Agreement.

64
0:03:42.369,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So while there are also good developments, of course --

65
0:03:45.585,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there are installations of wind and solar energy all over the globe, yes --

66
0:03:49.751,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but these positive changes are slow -- too slow, in fact.

67
0:03:53.895,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So since the Paris Agreement was signed,

68
0:03:56.594,000 --> 0:03:59,000
climate graphs keep racing to the top,

69
0:03:59.673,000 --> 0:04:01,000
smashing records every year.

70
0:04:02.432,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The five hottest years ever recorded

71
0:04:04.888,000 --> 0:04:06,000
were the previous five years,

72
0:04:07.415,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and at no time have global emissions been higher than today.

73
0:04:15.003,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So there I was,

74
0:04:16.208,000 --> 0:04:19,000
seeing and understanding the science on the one side,

75
0:04:19.239,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but not seeing answers, not seeing the action, on the other side.

76
0:04:25.684,000 --> 0:04:27,000
At that point, I had enough.

77
0:04:28.641,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I wanted to go to the UN Climate Conference myself,

78
0:04:32.072,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that very place that was created to bring people together

79
0:04:36.648,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to fix the climate --

80
0:04:38.535,000 --> 0:04:4,000
except not really, apparently.

81
0:04:41.03,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This was last year.

82
0:04:42.204,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I traveled to the Climate Conference and wanted to find out

83
0:04:45.476,000 --> 0:04:47,000
what this is really like, what this is about.

84
0:04:49.344,000 --> 0:04:53,000
For political realists, this might be no surprise,

85
0:04:54.253,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but I found it hard to bear:

86
0:04:56.402,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that fossil fuel industries and political leaders

87
0:05:01.878,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are doing everything, everything to prevent real change from happening.

88
0:05:06.823,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They are not keen to set targets that are ambitious enough

89
0:05:10.455,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to put us on a below-two-degree pathway.

90
0:05:14.163,000 --> 0:05:19,000
After all, these are the only ones who benefit from this climate crisis, right?

91
0:05:19.665,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The fossil fuel industry generates profits,

92
0:05:22.58,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and political leaders, well, they look at the next election,

93
0:05:26.178,000 --> 0:05:27,000
at what makes them popular,

94
0:05:27.683,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I guess that's not asking the inconvenient questions.

95
0:05:31.76,000 --> 0:05:34,000
There is no intention for them to change the game.

96
0:05:35.393,000 --> 0:05:4,000
There is no country in the world where either companies or political powers

97
0:05:40.543,000 --> 0:05:43,000
are sanctioned for wrecking the climate.

98
0:05:46.201,000 --> 0:05:51,000
With all the strangeness and the sadness about this conference,

99
0:05:51.997,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there was one someone who was different,

100
0:05:54.255,000 --> 0:05:58,000
someone who seemed to be quite worried,

101
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and that was Greta Thunberg.

102
0:06:01.129,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I decided right there that everything else seemed hopeless

103
0:06:05.494,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and didn't seem to make sense,

104
0:06:06.995,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so I joined her climate strike right there at the conference.

105
0:06:10.292,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It was my very first climate strike ever

106
0:06:13.111,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and an incredibly strange setting,

107
0:06:15.357,000 --> 0:06:18,000
just me and her sitting there at this conference hall,

108
0:06:18.598,000 --> 0:06:22,000
surrounded by this busyness of the suit-wearing conference crowd

109
0:06:23.57,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who had no idea what to do with us.

110
0:06:27.602,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And yet, this felt more powerful

111
0:06:31.624,000 --> 0:06:34,000
than anything I had expected in a very long time.

112
0:06:36.279,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And it was right there that I felt it was maybe time

113
0:06:40.03,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to start striking in Germany.

114
0:06:41.697,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was now certain that no one else was going to fix this for us,

115
0:06:45.267,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and if there was just the slightest chance that this could make a difference,

116
0:06:51.133,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it seemed almost foolish not to give it a go.

117
0:06:55.482,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So I --

118
0:06:57.644,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

119
0:07:06.805,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So I traveled back to Berlin.

120
0:07:08.589,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I found allies who had the same idea at the same time,

121
0:07:12.443,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and together we thought we'd give this "Fridays For Future" thing a go.

122
0:07:16.458,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Obviously, we had no idea what we were getting into.

123
0:07:19.991,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Before our first strike, many of us, including me,

124
0:07:23.003,000 --> 0:07:27,000
had never organized a public demonstration or any kind of protest before.

125
0:07:27.951,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We had no money, no resources

126
0:07:29.867,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and absolutely no idea what climate striking really is.

127
0:07:33.746,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So we started doing what we were good at:

128
0:07:37.099,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we started texting,

129
0:07:38.934,000 --> 0:07:4,000
texting en masse, night and day, everyone we could reach,

130
0:07:41.836,000 --> 0:07:44,000
organizing our first climate strike via WhatsApp.

131
0:07:46.105,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The night before our first strike, I was so nervous I couldn't sleep.

132
0:07:50.481,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I didn't know what to expect, but I expected the worst.

133
0:07:56.188,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Maybe it was because we weren't the only ones

134
0:08:02.096,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who had been longing to have a voice in a political environment

135
0:08:06.582,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that had seemingly forgotten how to include young people's perspective

136
0:08:10.834,000 --> 0:08:12,000
into decision-making, maybe.

137
0:08:14.049,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But somehow this worked out.

138
0:08:16.987,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And from one day to the other,

139
0:08:19.514,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we were all over the place.

140
0:08:21.666,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I, from one day to the other,

141
0:08:24.914,000 --> 0:08:25,000
became a climate activist.

142
0:08:29.459,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Usually,

143
0:08:31.983,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in these kind of TED Talks,

144
0:08:34.274,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I would now say how it's overly hopeful,

145
0:08:37.287,000 --> 0:08:39,000
how we young people are going to get this sorted,

146
0:08:39.787,000 --> 0:08:42,000
how we're going to save the future and the planet and everything else,

147
0:08:43.255,000 --> 0:08:45,000
how we young people striking for the climate

148
0:08:45.62,000 --> 0:08:46,000
are going to fix this.

149
0:08:47.671,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Usually.

150
0:08:50.677,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But this is not how this works.

151
0:08:52.238,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This is not how this crisis works.

152
0:08:56.223,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Here's a twist:

153
0:08:59.049,000 --> 0:09:04,000
today, three and a half years after that Paris Agreement was signed,

154
0:09:04.574,000 --> 0:09:06,000
when we look at the science,

155
0:09:07.239,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we find it's still possible to keep global warming

156
0:09:10.343,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to below two degrees --

157
0:09:13.107,000 --> 0:09:14,000
technically.

158
0:09:15.442,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we also see it's still possible to hold other disastrous developments

159
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we're seeing, such as mass extinction and soil degradation --

160
0:09:22.344,000 --> 0:09:24,000
yes, technically.

161
0:09:25.668,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's just incredibly, incredibly unlikely.

162
0:09:33.341,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And in any case,

163
0:09:35.824,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the world would have to see changes

164
0:09:39.175,000 --> 0:09:41,000
which we have never experienced before.

165
0:09:42.102,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We'd have to fully decarbonize our economies by 2050

166
0:09:46.036,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and transform the distribution of powers

167
0:09:48.721,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that is currently allowing those fossil fuel giants and political leaders

168
0:09:52.7,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to stay on top of the game.

169
0:09:55.562,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We are talking of nothing less than the greatest transformation

170
0:09:59.735,000 --> 0:10:,000
since the Industrial Revolution.

171
0:10:01.717,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We are talking, if you want to put it that way,

172
0:10:03.942,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we are talking of a climate revolution

173
0:10:07.637,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in a minimum amount of time.

174
0:10:09.822,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We wouldn't have a single further year to lose.

175
0:10:14.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And in any case, for any of that change to happen,

176
0:10:19.889,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the world needs to stop relying on

177
0:10:23.402,000 --> 0:10:27,000
one or two or three million school strikers to sort this out.

178
0:10:28.286,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Yes, we are great, we are going to keep going,

179
0:10:30.851,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and we are going to go to places no one ever expected us, yes.

180
0:10:34.888,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But we are not the limit;

181
0:10:36.757,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we are the start.

182
0:10:39.414,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is not a job for a single generation.

183
0:10:41.875,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This is a job for humanity.

184
0:10:44.692,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And this is when all eyes are on you.

185
0:10:50.411,000 --> 0:10:51,000
For this change to happen,

186
0:10:51.778,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we will have to get one million things sorted.

187
0:10:56.051,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's an incredibly complex thing, after all.

188
0:10:59.897,000 --> 0:11:,000
But ...

189
0:11:02.376,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there are some things that everyone can get started with.

190
0:11:05.721,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Bad news first: if you thought I would tell you now to cycle more

191
0:11:09.513,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or eat less meat, to fly less, or to go secondhand shopping,

192
0:11:12.908,000 --> 0:11:14,000
sorry, this is not that easy.

193
0:11:15.477,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But here comes the good news:

194
0:11:17.633,000 --> 0:11:21,000
you are more than consumers and shoppers,

195
0:11:21.906,000 --> 0:11:24,000
even though the industry would like you to keep yourselves limited to that.

196
0:11:25.626,000 --> 0:11:29,000
No; me and you -- we are all political beings,

197
0:11:30.421,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and we can all be part of this answer.

198
0:11:33.992,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We can all be something that many people call climate activists.

199
0:11:38.578,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Yay?

200
0:11:39.766,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

201
0:11:41.32,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So what are the first steps?

202
0:11:42.762,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Four first steps that are essential to get everything else done,

203
0:11:46.732,000 --> 0:11:49,000
four first steps that everyone can get started with,

204
0:11:50.529,000 --> 0:11:55,000
four first steps that decide about everything that can happen after.

205
0:11:57.178,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So what's that?

206
0:11:59.573,000 --> 0:12:,000
Number one:

207
0:12:02.086,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we need to drastically reframe our understanding of a climate activist,

208
0:12:06.078,000 --> 0:12:1,000
our understanding of who can be the answer to this.

209
0:12:11.977,000 --> 0:12:14,000
A climate activist isn't that one person that's read every single study

210
0:12:15.692,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and is now spending every afternoon handing out leaflets about vegetarianism

211
0:12:20.674,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in shopping malls.

212
0:12:21.864,000 --> 0:12:22,000
No.

213
0:12:23.1,000 --> 0:12:26,000
A climate activist can be everyone,

214
0:12:26.25,000 --> 0:12:31,000
everyone who wants to join a movement of those who intend to grow old

215
0:12:31.465,000 --> 0:12:34,000
on a planet that prioritizes protection of natural environments

216
0:12:35.393,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and happiness and health for the many

217
0:12:38.13,000 --> 0:12:42,000
over the destruction of the climate and the wrecking of the planet

218
0:12:42.474,000 --> 0:12:43,000
for the profits of the few.

219
0:12:45.232,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And since the climate crisis is affecting every single part of our social,

220
0:12:49.929,000 --> 0:12:51,000
of our political and of our private life,

221
0:12:52.492,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we need climate activists everywhere on every corner,

222
0:12:55.569,000 --> 0:12:56,000
not only in every room,

223
0:12:56.971,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but also in every city and country and state and continent.

224
0:13:02.478,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Second:

225
0:13:05.341,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I need you to get out of that zone of convenience,

226
0:13:09.963,000 --> 0:13:12,000
away from a business as usual that has no tomorrow.

227
0:13:14.931,000 --> 0:13:17,000
All of you here, you are either a friend or a family member,

228
0:13:18.917,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you are a worker, a colleague, a student, a teacher

229
0:13:21.537,000 --> 0:13:22,000
or, in many cases, a voter.

230
0:13:23.632,000 --> 0:13:26,000
All of this comes along with a responsibility

231
0:13:26.68,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that this crisis requires you to grow up to.

232
0:13:30.776,000 --> 0:13:33,000
There's the company that employs you

233
0:13:34.282,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or that sponsors you.

234
0:13:36.477,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Is it on track of meeting the Paris Agreement?

235
0:13:39.932,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Does your local parliamentarian know that you care about this,

236
0:13:43.052,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that you want this to be a priority in every election?

237
0:13:45.673,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Does your best friend know about this?

238
0:13:48.077,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Do you read a newspaper or write a newspaper? Great.

239
0:13:52.075,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Then let them know you want them to report on this in every issue,

240
0:13:55.459,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and that you want them to challenge decision makers in every single interview.

241
0:14:01.878,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If you're a singer, sing about this. If you're a teacher, teach about this.

242
0:14:05.475,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And if you have a bank account, tell your bank you're going to leave

243
0:14:08.751,000 --> 0:14:09,000
if they keep investing in fossil fuels.

244
0:14:11.41,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And, of course, on Fridays, you should all know what to do.

245
0:14:17.495,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Thirdly:

246
0:14:19.34,000 --> 0:14:24,000
leaving that zone of convenience works best when you join forces.

247
0:14:26.608,000 --> 0:14:29,000
One person asking for inconvenient change

248
0:14:29.774,000 --> 0:14:32,000
is mostly inconvenient.

249
0:14:33.421,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Two, five, ten, one hundred people asking for inconvenient change

250
0:14:37.326,000 --> 0:14:38,000
are hard to ignore.

251
0:14:38.907,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The more you are, the harder it gets for people to justify

252
0:14:41.897,000 --> 0:14:43,000
a system that has no future.

253
0:14:44.831,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Power is not something that you either have or don't have.

254
0:14:47.992,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Power is something you either take or leave to others,

255
0:14:50.938,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and it grows once you share it.

256
0:14:54.317,000 --> 0:14:56,000
We young people on the streets, we school strikers,

257
0:14:56.858,000 --> 0:14:58,000
we are showing how this can work out.

258
0:14:59.08,000 --> 0:15:03,000
One single school striker will always be one single school striker --

259
0:15:03.363,000 --> 0:15:04,000
well, Greta Thunberg.

260
0:15:04.822,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Two, five, ten, one thousand people striking school are a movement,

261
0:15:08.041,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and that's what we need everywhere.

262
0:15:09.858,000 --> 0:15:1,000
No pressure.

263
0:15:11.103,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Laughter)

264
0:15:12.955,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And number four, finally --

265
0:15:15.9,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and this is probably the most important aspect of all of this --

266
0:15:23.653,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I need you to start taking yourselves more seriously.

267
0:15:28.457,000 --> 0:15:3,000
If there's one thing I've learned

268
0:15:30.751,000 --> 0:15:33,000
during seven months of organizing climate action,

269
0:15:34.634,000 --> 0:15:36,000
it's that if you don't go for something,

270
0:15:37.84,000 --> 0:15:39,000
chances are high that no one else will.

271
0:15:41.724,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The most powerful institutions of this world

272
0:15:45.364,000 --> 0:15:5,000
have no intention of changing the game they're profiting from most,

273
0:15:50.391,000 --> 0:15:52,000
so there's no point in further relying on them.

274
0:15:54.308,000 --> 0:15:55,000
That's scary, I know.

275
0:15:56.341,000 --> 0:16:,000
That's a huge responsibility, a huge burden on everyone's shoulders, yes.

276
0:16:01.716,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But this also means,

277
0:16:03.608,000 --> 0:16:04,000
if we want to,

278
0:16:05.857,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we can have a say in this.

279
0:16:09.191,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We can be part of that change. We can be part of that answer.

280
0:16:13.038,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And that's quite beautiful, right?

281
0:16:16.484,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So let's give it a try, let's rock and roll,

282
0:16:18.626,000 --> 0:16:2,000
let's flood the world with climate activists.

283
0:16:21.649,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Let's get out of the zones of convenience

284
0:16:24.016,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and join forces and start taking ourselves more seriously.

285
0:16:29.119,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Imagine what this world would look like,

286
0:16:31.718,000 --> 0:16:33,000
where children would grow up,

287
0:16:34.657,000 --> 0:16:4,000
knowing their future was this one great adventure to look forward to

288
0:16:40.804,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and nothing to be scared of,

289
0:16:43.905,000 --> 0:16:46,000
what this world would look like when the next climate conference

290
0:16:47.592,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is this great happening of people who come together,

291
0:16:52.09,000 --> 0:16:54,000
who had heard the voices of millions,

292
0:16:54.66,000 --> 0:16:58,000
who would then roll up their sleeves, ready to create real change.

293
0:17:00.152,000 --> 0:17:01,000
You know,

294
0:17:02.394,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I dream of this world

295
0:17:05.057,000 --> 0:17:1,000
where geography classes teach about the climate crisis

296
0:17:11.076,000 --> 0:17:14,000
as this one greatest challenge

297
0:17:14.147,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that was won by people like you and me,

298
0:17:18.865,000 --> 0:17:2,000
who had started acting in time

299
0:17:21.2,000 --> 0:17:24,000
because they understood they had nothing to lose

300
0:17:24.92,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and everything to win.

301
0:17:28.472,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So why not give it a go?

302
0:17:30.012,000 --> 0:17:32,000
No one else will save the future for us.

303
0:17:32.842,000 --> 0:17:34,000
This is more than an invitation. Spread the word.

304
0:17:35.309,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you.

305
0:17:36.543,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Applause)

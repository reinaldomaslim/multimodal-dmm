1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I go on the podium.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You know, this little office of the conductor.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with a lot of space.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And in front of all that noise,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you do a very small gesture.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Noise becomes music.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to think that it's all about me.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
All those great people here, virtuosos,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
they make noise, they need me to do that.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Not really. If it were that,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I would just save you the talk,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and teach you the gesture.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So you could go out to the world

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Let's look at the first video.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Music)

28
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Was that nice?

29
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So that was a sort of a success.

30
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now, who should we thank for the success?

31
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians

32
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
playing beautifully,

33
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

34
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They don't often even look at the conductor.

35
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,

36
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
actually taking part in doing the music.

37
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.

38
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast

39
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that you will ever get in Vienna.

40
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.

42
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say

43
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.

44
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."

45
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

46
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So that's a sort of a tradition.

47
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But Viennese audiences do not do that.

48
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,

49
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.

50
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You know, audiences like you, yeah,

51
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
make the event.

52
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But what about the conductor? What can you say

53
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the conductor was doing, actually?

54
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Um, he was happy.

55
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And I often show this to senior management.

56
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
People get annoyed.

57
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"

58
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.

59
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness

60
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
does not come from

61
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
only his own story and his joy of the music.

62
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The joy is about enabling other people's stories

63
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to be heard at the same time.

64
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.

65
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.

66
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You have the stories of the individuals

67
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the orchestra and in the audience.

68
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then you have other stories, unseen.

69
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
People who build this wonderful concert hall.

70
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.

71
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And all those stories are being heard at the same time.

72
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is the true experience of a live concert.

73
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?

74
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And not all conductors do just that.

75
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.

76
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Riccardo Muti, please.

77
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Music)

78
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Yeah, that was very short, but you could see

79
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
it's a completely different figure. Right?

80
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?

81
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.

82
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?

83
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?

84
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.

85
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Okay? Ready?

86
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000

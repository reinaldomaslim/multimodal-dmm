0:00:04.68,000 --> 0:00:05,000
Today, I'd like to talk with you

2
0:00:06.4,000 --> 0:00:11,000
about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic.

3
0:00:11.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
But, unfortunately, it's become incredibly controversial.

4
0:00:17.72,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This year, if you think about it,

5
0:00:19.96,000 --> 0:00:22,000
over a billion couples will have sex with one another.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Couples like this one,

7
0:00:26.72,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and this one,

8
0:00:28.48,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and this one,

9
0:00:29.96,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and, yes,

10
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
even this one.

11
0:00:32.84,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And my idea is this --

13
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
all these men and women should be free to decide

14
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
whether they do or do not want to conceive a child.

15
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And they should be able to use one of these birth control methods

16
0:00:49.68,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to act on their decision.

17
0:00:53.56,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, I think you'd have a hard time

18
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
finding many people who disagree with this idea.

19
0:01:00.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all.

20
0:01:07.92,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They want the power to plan their own lives

21
0:01:12.08,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and to raise healthier, better educated and more prosperous families.

22
0:01:18.72,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But, for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private,

23
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:28,000
birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public.

24
0:01:30.04,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Some people think when we talk about contraception

25
0:01:33.48,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that it's code for abortion,

26
0:01:35.56,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which it's not.

27
0:01:37.24,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Some people -- let's be honest --

28
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex.

29
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Some people worry

30
0:01:45.6,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that the real goal of family planning is to control populations.

31
0:01:51.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
These are all side issues

32
0:01:55.08,000 --> 0:02:,000
that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women

33
0:02:00.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
should be able to decide when they want to have a child.

34
0:02:05.76,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And as a result, birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared

35
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:13,000
from the global health agenda.

36
0:02:14.8,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The victims of this paralysis are the people of sub-Saharan Africa

37
0:02:21.04,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and South Asia.

38
0:02:23.56,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Here in Germany, the proportion of people that use contraception

39
0:02:27.96,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is about 66 percent.

40
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That's about what you'd expect.

41
0:02:32.48,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.

42
0:02:36.44,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Thailand, 64 percent.

43
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But let's compare that to other places,

44
0:02:42.32,000 --> 0:02:45,000
like Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest states in India.

45
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, if Uttar Pradesh was its own country,

46
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it would be the fifth largest country in the world.

47
0:02:54.36,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Their contraception rate -- 29 percent.

48
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, 10 percent.

49
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Chad, 2 percent.

50
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Let's just take one country in Africa, Senegal.

51
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Their rate is about 12 percent.

52
0:03:15.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But why is it so low?

53
0:03:17.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
One reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available.

54
0:03:24.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Women in Africa will tell you over and over again

55
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that what they prefer today is an injectable.

56
0:03:30.12,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They get it in their arm -- and they go about four times a year,

57
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they have to get it every three months -- to get their injection.

58
0:03:37.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands,

59
0:03:43.12,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who sometimes want a lot of children.

60
0:03:45.8,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,

61
0:03:51.32,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that injection is stocked out.

62
0:03:53.96,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's stocked out 150 days out of the year.

63
0:03:58.92,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So can you imagine the situation --

64
0:04:00.8,000 --> 0:04:02,000
she walks all this way to go get her injection.

65
0:04:03.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
She leaves her field, sometimes leaves her children,

66
0:04:06.92,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and it's not there.

67
0:04:08.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And she doesn't know when it's going to be available again.

68
0:04:11.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This is the same story across the continent of Africa today.

69
0:04:17.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And so what we've created as a world has become a life-and-death crisis.

70
0:04:22.039,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There are 100,000 women [per year] who say they don't want to be pregnant

71
0:04:28.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and they die in childbirth -- 100,000 women a year.

72
0:04:32.6,000 --> 0:04:34,000
There are another 600,000 women [per year]

73
0:04:35.04,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place,

74
0:04:37.88,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and they give birth to a baby

75
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and her baby dies in that first month of life.

76
0:04:44.36,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children.

77
0:04:51.32,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But somewhere along the way, we got confused by our own conversation.

78
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we stopped trying to save these lives.

79
0:05:01.68,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So if we're going to make progress on this issue,

80
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we have to be really clear about what our agenda is.

81
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We're not talking about abortion.

82
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We're not talking about population control.

83
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives,

84
0:05:21.68,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to save their children's lives

85
0:05:23.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and to give their families the best possible future.

86
0:05:28.6,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, as a world,

87
0:05:30.48,000 --> 0:05:33,000
there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community

88
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:35,000
if we want to make the world better in the future --

89
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:37,000
things like fight diseases.

90
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So many children today die of diarrhea, as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.

91
0:05:43.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
They kill literally millions of children a year.

92
0:05:45.88,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We also need to help small farmers --

93
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
farmers who plow small plots of land in Africa --

94
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so that they can grow enough food to feed their children.

95
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we have to make sure that children are educated around the world.

96
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do

97
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is to give everybody access to birth control methods

98
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that almost all Germans have access to and all Americans, at some point,

99
0:06:14.24,000 --> 0:06:16,000
they use these tools during their life.

100
0:06:17.52,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is,

101
0:06:23.64,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there's a global movement waiting to happen

102
0:06:26.28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea.

103
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
When I grew up, I grew up in a Catholic home.

104
0:06:36.32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I still consider myself a practicing Catholic.

105
0:06:39.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
My mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.

106
0:06:43.92,000 --> 0:06:46,000
My great-aunt was a Dominican nun.

107
0:06:47.36,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life.

108
0:06:51.12,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In fact, she's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read.

109
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I was very close to her.

110
0:06:57.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I went to Catholic schools for my entire childhood

111
0:07:01.04,000 --> 0:07:03,000
until I left home to go to university.

112
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In my high school, Ursuline Academy,

113
0:07:07.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school.

114
0:07:14.6,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Today, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,

115
0:07:16.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I believe I'm applying the lessons that I learned in high school.

116
0:07:22.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,

117
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the nuns also taught us to question received teachings.

118
0:07:31.72,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned

119
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
was is birth control really a sin?

120
0:07:41.92,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Because I think one of the reasons

121
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we have this huge discomfort talking about contraception

122
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is this lingering concern

123
0:07:50.04,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that if we separate sex from reproduction, we're going to promote promiscuity.

124
0:07:56.08,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I think that's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception --

125
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
what is its impact on sexual morality?

126
0:08:05.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But, like most women,

127
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:11,000
my decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity.

128
0:08:12.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I had a plan for my future. I wanted to go to college.

129
0:08:15.84,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I studied really hard in college,

130
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and I was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates

131
0:08:22.96,000 --> 0:08:23,000
at my university.

132
0:08:24.8,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I wanted to have a career, so I went on to business school

133
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and I became one of the youngest female executives at Microsoft.

134
0:08:33.56,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I still remember, though, when I left my parents' home

135
0:08:36.679,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to move across the country to start this new job at Microsoft.

136
0:08:40.64,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education.

137
0:08:46.64,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But they said, as I left home --

138
0:08:48.24,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I literally went down the front steps, down the porch at home --

139
0:08:51.6,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they said,

140
0:08:52.84,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"Even though you've had this great education,

141
0:08:55.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
if you decide to get married and have kids right away,

142
0:09:01.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that's OK by us, too."

143
0:09:03.6,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest.

144
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I was free to decide what that would be.

145
0:09:11.84,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It was an amazing feeling.

146
0:09:15.2,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In fact, I did want to have kids --

147
0:09:19.12,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but I wanted to have them when I was ready.

148
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And so now, Bill and I have three.

149
0:09:26.52,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And when our eldest daughter was born,

150
0:09:29.48,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we weren't, I would say, exactly sure how to be great parents.

151
0:09:33.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Maybe some of you know that feeling.

152
0:09:35.76,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And so we waited a little while before we had our second child.

153
0:09:39.56,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And it's no accident that we have three children

154
0:09:43.24,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that are spaced three years apart.

155
0:09:46.12,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Now, as a mother, what do I want the very most for my children?

156
0:09:52.04,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I want them to feel the way I did --

157
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
like they can do anything they want to do in life.

158
0:10:00.56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And so, what has struck me

159
0:10:02.2,000 --> 0:10:06,000
as I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world

160
0:10:06.8,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is that all women want that same thing.

161
0:10:12.04,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums, in one called Korogocho --

162
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which literally means when translated, "standing shoulder to shoulder."

163
0:10:22.4,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here.

164
0:10:25.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums,

165
0:10:29.6,000 --> 0:10:3,000
what it was like.

166
0:10:31.04,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control.

167
0:10:35.44,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Marianne, in the center of the screen in the red sweater,

168
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:41,000
she summed up that entire two-hour conversation

169
0:10:42.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in a phrase that I will never forget.

170
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:51,000
She said, "I want to bring every good thing to this child

171
0:10:53.04,000 --> 0:10:54,000
before I have another."

172
0:10:55.64,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I thought -- that's it.

173
0:10:57.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That's universal.

174
0:10:59.76,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We all want to bring every good thing to our children.

175
0:11:05.48,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing.

176
0:11:10.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So many women suffer from domestic violence.

177
0:11:13.2,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And they can't even broach the subject of contraception,

178
0:11:16.28,000 --> 0:11:17,000
even inside their own marriage.

179
0:11:18.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There are many women who lack basic education.

180
0:11:22.36,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power

181
0:11:27.96,000 --> 0:11:29,000
don't have access to contraceptives.

182
0:11:30.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
For 250 years, parents around the world

183
0:11:35.68,000 --> 0:11:37,000
have been deciding to have smaller families.

184
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium,

185
0:11:43.68,000 --> 0:11:45,000
across cultures and across geographies,

186
0:11:47.32,000 --> 0:11:52,000
with the glaring exception of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

187
0:11:54.44,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The French started bringing down their family size in the mid-1700s.

188
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And over the next 150 years, this trend spread all across Europe.

189
0:12:05.52,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The surprising thing to me, as I learned this history,

190
0:12:09.12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines.

191
0:12:15.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
People who spoke the same language made that change as a group.

192
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They made the same choice for their family,

193
0:12:22.44,000 --> 0:12:25,000
whether they were rich or whether they were poor.

194
0:12:26.92,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The reason that trend toward smaller families spread

195
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
was that this whole way was driven by an idea --

196
0:12:33.84,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the idea that couples can exercise conscious control

197
0:12:38.88,000 --> 0:12:39,000
over how many children they have.

198
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is a very powerful idea.

199
0:12:46.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It means that parents have the ability to affect the future,

200
0:12:50.92,000 --> 0:12:53,000
not just accept it as it is.

201
0:12:55.48,000 --> 0:12:59,000
In France, the average family size went down every decade

202
0:12:59.56,000 --> 0:13:02,000
for 150 years in a row until it stabilized.

203
0:13:03.96,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It took so long back then because the contraceptives weren't that good.

204
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In Germany, this transition started in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years

205
0:13:15.24,000 --> 0:13:17,000
for family size to stabilize in this country.

206
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And in Asia and Latin America, the transition started in the 1960s,

207
0:13:23.28,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and it happened much faster because of modern contraception.

208
0:13:29.68,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I think, as we go through this history, it's important to pause for a moment

209
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue.

210
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It's because some family planning programs

211
0:13:43.28,000 --> 0:13:47,000
resorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies.

212
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:55,000
For instance, in the 1960s, India adopted very specific numeric targets

213
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies.

214
0:14:00.72,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Now, Indian women were really smart in this situation.

215
0:14:04.12,000 --> 0:14:07,000
When they went to get an IUD inserted, they got paid six rupees.

216
0:14:07.64,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And so what did they do?

217
0:14:09.48,000 --> 0:14:11,000
They waited a few hours or a few days,

218
0:14:11.52,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and they went to another service provider and had the IUD removed for one rupee.

219
0:14:18.72,000 --> 0:14:2,000
For decades in the United States,

220
0:14:21.8,000 --> 0:14:25,000
African-American women were sterilized without their consent.

221
0:14:27.4,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The procedure was so common

222
0:14:29.64,000 --> 0:14:32,000
it became known as the Mississippi appendectomy --

223
0:14:33.72,000 --> 0:14:36,000
a tragic chapter in my country's history.

224
0:14:37.92,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,

225
0:14:40.72,000 --> 0:14:43,000
women from the Andes region were given anesthesia

226
0:14:44.24,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and they were sterilized without their knowledge.

227
0:14:48.72,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The most startling thing about this

228
0:14:51.36,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is that these coercive policies weren't even needed.

229
0:14:54.12,000 --> 0:14:55,000
They were carried out in places

230
0:14:55.96,000 --> 0:14:59,000
where parents already wanted to lower their family size.

231
0:15:00.64,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Because in region after region, again and again,

232
0:15:03.96,000 --> 0:15:05,000
parents have wanted to have smaller families.

233
0:15:08.12,000 --> 0:15:09,000
There's no reason to believe

234
0:15:09.92,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that African women have innately different desires.

235
0:15:14.04,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Given the option, they will have fewer children.

236
0:15:18.6,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The question is:

237
0:15:20.12,000 --> 0:15:25,000
will we invest in helping all women get what they want now?

238
0:15:26.4,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Or, are we going to condemn them to some century-long struggle,

239
0:15:31.12,000 --> 0:15:33,000
as if this was still revolutionary France

240
0:15:33.88,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and the best method was coitus interruptus?

241
0:15:39.84,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Empowering parents -- it doesn't need justification.

242
0:15:45.08,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But here's the thing -- our desire to bring every good thing to our children

243
0:15:51.96,000 --> 0:15:53,000
is a force for good throughout the world.

244
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's what propels societies forward.

245
0:15:59.12,000 --> 0:16:02,000
In that same slum in Nairobi, I met a young businesswoman,

246
0:16:03.08,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and she was making backpacks out of her home.

247
0:16:05.32,000 --> 0:16:08,000
She and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory

248
0:16:08.68,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and collect scraps of denim.

249
0:16:10.44,000 --> 0:16:12,000
She'd create these backpacks and resell them.

250
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And when I talked with her, she had three children,

251
0:16:15.405,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and I asked her about her family.

252
0:16:17.005,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And she said she and her husband decided

253
0:16:19.12,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that they wanted to stop having children after their third one.

254
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And so when I asked her why, she simply said,

255
0:16:24.84,000 --> 0:16:27,000
"Well, because I couldn't run my business if I had another child."

256
0:16:28.36,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And she explained the income that she was getting out of her business

257
0:16:31.623,000 --> 0:16:34,000
afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children.

258
0:16:35.8,000 --> 0:16:39,000
She was incredibly optimistic about her family's future.

259
0:16:41.68,000 --> 0:16:43,000
This is the same mental calculus

260
0:16:44.24,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through.

261
0:16:48.44,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And evidence proves that they have it exactly right.

262
0:16:52.84,000 --> 0:16:55,000
They are able to give their children more opportunities

263
0:16:56.76,000 --> 0:16:59,000
by exercising control over when they have them.

264
0:17:01.8,000 --> 0:17:02,000
In Bangladesh,

265
0:17:03.12,000 --> 0:17:04,000
there's a district called Matlab.

266
0:17:05.08,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It's where researchers have collected data on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.

267
0:17:11.839,000 --> 0:17:12,000
In the global health community,

268
0:17:13.4,000 --> 0:17:16,000
we like to say it's one of the longest pieces of research that's been running.

269
0:17:17.119,000 --> 0:17:19,000
We have so many great health statistics.

270
0:17:19.32,000 --> 0:17:21,000
In one of the studies, what did they do?

271
0:17:21.879,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Half the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives.

272
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
They got education and access to contraception.

273
0:17:29.2,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Twenty years later, following those villages,

274
0:17:32.4,000 --> 0:17:36,000
what we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors.

275
0:17:36.44,000 --> 0:17:37,000
The families were healthier.

276
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
The women were less likely to die in childbirth.

277
0:17:41.32,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Their children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life.

278
0:17:45.36,000 --> 0:17:47,000
The children were better nourished.

279
0:17:47.68,000 --> 0:17:49,000
The families were also wealthier.

280
0:17:49.72,000 --> 0:17:51,000
The adult women's wages were higher.

281
0:17:52.24,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Households had more assets -- things like livestock or land or savings.

282
0:17:57.32,000 --> 0:18:,000
Finally, their sons and daughters had more schooling.

283
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families,

284
0:18:07.96,000 --> 0:18:1,000
the product can be large-scale economic development.

285
0:18:12.08,000 --> 0:18:16,000
People talk about the Asian economic miracle of the 1980s --

286
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
but it wasn't really a miracle.

287
0:18:18.24,000 --> 0:18:21,000
One of the leading causes of economic growth across that region

288
0:18:21.8,000 --> 0:18:24,000
was this cultural trend towards smaller families.

289
0:18:27.12,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Sweeping changes start at the individual family level --

290
0:18:31.04,000 --> 0:18:35,000
the family making a decision about what's best for their children.

291
0:18:36.28,000 --> 0:18:39,000
When they make that change and that decision,

292
0:18:39.32,000 --> 0:18:42,000
those become sweeping regional and national trends.

293
0:18:43.68,000 --> 0:18:47,000
When families in sub-Saharan Africa are given the opportunity

294
0:18:47.84,000 --> 0:18:49,000
to make those decisions for themselves,

295
0:18:50.8,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development

296
0:18:54.08,000 --> 0:18:56,000
in communities across the continent.

297
0:18:58.52,000 --> 0:19:01,000
We can help poor families build a better future.

298
0:19:02.4,000 --> 0:19:05,000
We can insist that all people have the opportunity

299
0:19:06.12,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to learn about contraceptives

300
0:19:08.08,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and have access to the full variety of methods.

301
0:19:12.56,000 --> 0:19:14,000
I think the goal here is really clear:

302
0:19:15.44,000 --> 0:19:19,000
universal access to birth control that women want.

303
0:19:20.88,000 --> 0:19:25,000
And for that to happen, it means that both rich and poor governments alike

304
0:19:26.2,000 --> 0:19:29,000
must make contraception a total priority.

305
0:19:30.28,000 --> 0:19:33,000
We can do our part, in this room and globally,

306
0:19:34.28,000 --> 0:19:37,000
by talking about the hundreds of millions of families

307
0:19:37.56,000 --> 0:19:39,000
that don't have access to contraception today

308
0:19:40.48,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access.

309
0:19:45.2,000 --> 0:19:48,000
I think if Marianne and the members of her women's group

310
0:19:48.96,000 --> 0:19:5,000
can talk about this openly

311
0:19:51.28,000 --> 0:19:54,000
and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public,

312
0:19:55.32,000 --> 0:19:56,000
we can, too.

313
0:19:57.28,000 --> 0:19:58,000
And we need to start now.

314
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:06,000
Because like Marianne, we all want to bring every good thing to our children.

315
0:20:07.32,000 --> 0:20:09,000
And where is the controversy in that?

316
0:20:10.68,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Thank you.

317
0:20:11.92,000 --> 0:20:13,000
(Applause)

318
0:20:14.68,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

319
0:20:22.88,000 --> 0:20:25,000
I have some questions for Melinda.

320
0:20:26.88,000 --> 0:20:27,000
(Applause ends)

321
0:20:28.2,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Thank you for your courage and everything else.

322
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
So, Melinda, in the last few years

323
0:20:34.52,000 --> 0:20:37,000
I've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of,

324
0:20:39.92,000 --> 0:20:42,000
"We don't need to worry about the population issue anymore.

325
0:20:43.4,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Family sizes are coming down naturally all over the world.

326
0:20:46.92,000 --> 0:20:48,000
We're going to peak at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."

327
0:20:51.24,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Are they wrong?

328
0:20:52.48,000 --> 0:20:54,000
Melinda Gates: If you look at the statistics across Africa,

329
0:20:55.28,000 --> 0:20:56,000
they are wrong.

330
0:20:56.52,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And I think we need to look at it, though, from a different lens.

331
0:20:59.6,000 --> 0:21:01,000
We need to look at it from the ground upwards.

332
0:21:01.8,000 --> 0:21:04,000
I think that's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble

333
0:21:05.08,000 --> 0:21:06,000
on this issue of contraception.

334
0:21:06.8,000 --> 0:21:07,000
We looked at it from top down

335
0:21:08.205,000 --> 0:21:11,000
and said we want to have different population numbers over time.

336
0:21:11.76,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Yes, we care about the planet. Yes, we need to make the right choices.

337
0:21:15.08,000 --> 0:21:17,000
But the choices have to be made at the family level.

338
0:21:17.68,000 --> 0:21:21,000
And it's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do

339
0:21:22.04,000 --> 0:21:25,000
that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally --

340
0:21:25.12,000 --> 0:21:29,000
except for sub-Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan.

341
0:21:32.44,000 --> 0:21:34,000
CA: Some people on the right in America

342
0:21:34.56,000 --> 0:21:37,000
and in many conservative cultures around the world

343
0:21:39.88,000 --> 0:21:4,000
might say something like this:

344
0:21:41.72,000 --> 0:21:44,000
"It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on.

345
0:21:45.411,000 --> 0:21:46,000
But, sex is sacred.

346
0:21:48.52,000 --> 0:21:52,000
What you're proposing is going to increase the likelihood

347
0:21:52.56,000 --> 0:21:54,000
that lots of sex happens outside marriage.

348
0:21:54.8,000 --> 0:21:55,000
And that is wrong."

349
0:21:57.12,000 --> 0:21:59,000
What would you say to them?

350
0:21:59.2,000 --> 0:22:02,000
MG: I would say that sex is absolutely sacred.

351
0:22:02.48,000 --> 0:22:05,000
And it's sacred in Germany, and it's sacred in the United States,

352
0:22:05.6,000 --> 0:22:08,000
and it's sacred in France and so many places around the world.

353
0:22:08.72,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And the fact that 98 percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced

354
0:22:13.64,000 --> 0:22:17,000
say they use birth control doesn't make sex any less sacred.

355
0:22:17.84,000 --> 0:22:2,000
It just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives.

356
0:22:21.12,000 --> 0:22:22,000
And I think in that choice,

357
0:22:22.44,000 --> 0:22:24,000
we're also honoring the sacredness of the family

358
0:22:25.36,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and the sacredness of the mother's life

359
0:22:27.64,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and the childrens' lives by saving their lives.

360
0:22:29.92,000 --> 0:22:31,000
To me, that's incredibly sacred, too.

361
0:22:33.28,000 --> 0:22:37,000
CA: So what is your foundation doing to promote this issue?

362
0:22:38.04,000 --> 0:22:42,000
And what could people here and people listening on the web --

363
0:22:42.08,000 --> 0:22:43,000
what would you like them to do?

364
0:22:43.64,000 --> 0:22:45,000
MG: I would say this -- join the conversation.

365
0:22:45.807,000 --> 0:22:49,000
We've listed the website up here. Join the conversation.

366
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:53,000
Tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life

367
0:22:53.84,000 --> 0:22:55,000
or somebody's life that you know.

368
0:22:55.88,000 --> 0:22:56,000
And say that you're for this.

369
0:22:57.285,000 --> 0:22:59,000
We need a groundswell of people saying, "This makes sense.

370
0:23:00.024,000 --> 0:23:03,000
We've got to give all women access -- no matter where they live."

371
0:23:03.44,000 --> 0:23:05,000
And one of the things that we're going to do

372
0:23:05.56,000 --> 0:23:08,000
is do a large event July 11 in London,

373
0:23:08.76,000 --> 0:23:11,000
with a whole host of countries, a whole host of African nations,

374
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:15,000
to all say we're putting this back on the global health agenda.

375
0:23:15.32,000 --> 0:23:16,000
We're going to commit resources to it,

376
0:23:17.2,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and we're going to do planning from the bottom up with governments

377
0:23:20.36,000 --> 0:23:22,000
to make sure that women are educated --

378
0:23:22.48,000 --> 0:23:24,000
so that if they want the tool, they have it,

379
0:23:24.96,000 --> 0:23:26,000
and that they have lots of options available

380
0:23:27.08,000 --> 0:23:29,000
either through their local healthcare worker

381
0:23:29.2,000 --> 0:23:3,000
or their local community rural clinic.

382
0:23:32.44,000 --> 0:23:36,000
CA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school

383
0:23:37.04,000 --> 0:23:39,000
are going to see this TED Talk at some point.

384
0:23:40.48,000 --> 0:23:42,000
Are they going to be horrified, or are they cheering you on?

385
0:23:43.4,000 --> 0:23:45,000
MG: I know they're going to see the TED Talk

386
0:23:45.52,000 --> 0:23:48,000
because they know that I'm doing it and I plan to send it to them.

387
0:23:48.68,000 --> 0:23:51,000
And, you know, the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive.

388
0:23:51.84,000 --> 0:23:52,000
I hope that they'll be very proud of me

389
0:23:53.76,000 --> 0:23:56,000
for living out what they taught us about social justice and service.

390
0:23:57.72,000 --> 0:24:,000
I have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue

391
0:24:01.64,000 --> 0:24:03,000
because of what I've seen in the developing world.

392
0:24:04.44,000 --> 0:24:08,000
And for me, this topic has become very close to heart

393
0:24:09.32,000 --> 0:24:12,000
because you meet these women and they are so often voiceless.

394
0:24:12.4,000 --> 0:24:13,000
And yet they shouldn't be --

395
0:24:13.76,000 --> 0:24:15,000
they should have a voice, they should have access.

396
0:24:16.32,000 --> 0:24:17,000
And so I hope they'll feel

397
0:24:17.6,000 --> 0:24:19,000
that I'm living out what I've learned from them

398
0:24:20.44,000 --> 0:24:23,000
and from the decades of work that I've already done at the foundation.

399
0:24:24.72,000 --> 0:24:28,000
CA: So, you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers

400
0:24:29.12,000 --> 0:24:31,000
to whom we're all grateful.

401
0:24:32.2,000 --> 0:24:33,000
Did you learn anything?

402
0:24:34.04,000 --> 0:24:35,000
(Laughter)

403
0:24:35.28,000 --> 0:24:38,000
MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things. I have so many follow-up questions.

404
0:24:39.12,000 --> 0:24:41,000
And I think a lot of this work is a journey.

405
0:24:41.4,000 --> 0:24:44,000
You heard the discussion about the journey through energy,

406
0:24:45.28,000 --> 0:24:47,000
or the journey through social design,

407
0:24:47.64,000 --> 0:24:48,000
or the journey in the coming and saying,

408
0:24:49.584,000 --> 0:24:51,000
"Why aren't there any women on this platform?"

409
0:24:51.76,000 --> 0:24:54,000
And I think for all of us who work on these development issues,

410
0:24:55.16,000 --> 0:24:56,000
you learn by talking to other people.

411
0:24:56.96,000 --> 0:24:58,000
You learn by doing. You learn by trying and making mistakes.

412
0:24:59.84,000 --> 0:25:,000
And it's the questions you ask.

413
0:25:01.36,000 --> 0:25:04,000
Sometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer

414
0:25:04.76,000 --> 0:25:06,000
the next person that can help you answer it.

415
0:25:06.88,000 --> 0:25:08,000
So I have lots of questions for the panelists from today.

416
0:25:09.6,000 --> 0:25:11,000
And I thought it was just an amazing day.

417
0:25:11.68,000 --> 0:25:14,000
CA: Melinda, thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you.

418
0:25:15.038,000 --> 0:25:17,000
Thank you so much. MG: Great. Thanks, Chris.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We're here to celebrate compassion.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But compassion, from my vantage point,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
has a problem.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As essential as it is across our traditions,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
as real as so many of us know it to be

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in particular lives,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it is suspect in my field of journalism.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or it's seen as potentially depressing.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of giving a speech in Holland

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and, after the fact, the word "compassion"

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
was translated as "pity."

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now compassion, when it enters the news,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
too often comes in the form

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of feel-good feature pieces

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or sidebars about heroic people

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
you could never be like

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or happy endings

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or examples of self-sacrifice

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that would seem to be too good to be true

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
most of the time.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Our cultural imagination about compassion

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
has been deadened by idealistic images.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And so what I'd like to do this morning

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for the next few minutes

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is perform a linguistic resurrection.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that words matter,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that they shape the way we understand ourselves,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the way we interpret the world

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the way we treat others.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
When this country

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
first encountered genuine diversity

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the 1960s,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we adopted tolerance

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as the core civic virtue

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with which we would approach that.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
connotes "allowing," "indulging"

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and "enduring."

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In the medical context that it comes from,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it is about testing the limits of thriving

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in an unfavorable environment.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue;

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it's more of a cerebral ascent.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it's too cerebral

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to animate guts and hearts

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and behavior

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when the going gets rough.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the going is pretty rough right now.

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I think that without perhaps being able to name it,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we are collectively experiencing

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that we've come as far as we can

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Compassion is a worthy successor.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It is organic,

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and yet it transcends them.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that could change us if we truly let it sink into

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the standards to which we hold ourselves and others,

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
both in our private and in our civic spaces.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So what is it, three-dimensionally?

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What are its kindred and component parts?

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
To start simply,

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I want to say that compassion is kind.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But kindness is an everyday byproduct

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of all the great virtues.

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And it is a most edifying form

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
of instant gratification.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Compassion is also curious.

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I love a phrase that was offered me

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
by two young women

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They are working to create a new imagination

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about shared life among young Jews and Muslims,

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and as they do that, they cultivate what they call

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"curiosity without assumptions."

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It can be joined with the harder work

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of forgiveness and reconciliation,

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but it can also express itself

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the simple act of presence.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's linked to practical virtues

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
like generosity and hospitality

94
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and just being there,

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
just showing up.

96
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I think that compassion

97
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
also is often linked to beauty --

98
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and by that I mean a willingness

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to see beauty in the other,

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
not just what it is about them

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that might need helping.

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
often speak of beauty as a core moral value.

104
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And in that light, for the religious,

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
compassion also brings us

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
into the territory of mystery --

107
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
encouraging us not just

108
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to see beauty,

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but perhaps also to look for the face of God

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in the moment of suffering,

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in the face of a stranger,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in the face of the vibrant religious other.

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'm not sure if I can show you

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
what tolerance looks like,

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but I can show you what compassion looks like --

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because it is visible.

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When we see it, we recognize it

118
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and it changes the way we think about what is doable,

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what is possible.

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It is so important

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when we're communicating big ideas --

122
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to root it as we present it to others

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in space and time and flesh and blood --

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the color and complexity of life.

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And compassion does seek physicality.

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I first started to learn this most vividly

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from Matthew Sanford.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I don't imagine that you will realize this

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when you look at this photograph of him,

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but he's paraplegic.

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and -- and he does experience this as an "and"

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
rather than a "but" --

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and he experiences himself

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to be healed and whole.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And as a teacher of yoga,

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
he brings that experience to others

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
across the spectrum of ability and disability,

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
health, illness and aging.

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
He says that he's just at an extreme end

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of the spectrum we're all on.

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He's doing some amazing work now

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.

150
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But he says that he has yet to experience someone

151
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
who became more aware of their body,

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in all its frailty and its grace,

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
without, at the same time,

154
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
becoming more compassionate towards all of life.

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Compassion also looks like this.

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is Jean Vanier.

157
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,

158
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which you can now find all over the world,

159
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
communities centered around life

160
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with people with mental disabilities --

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
mostly Down syndrome.

162
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The communities that Jean Vanier founded,

163
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
like Jean Vanier himself,

164
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
exude tenderness.

165
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"Tender" is another word

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I would love to spend some time resurrecting.

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We spend so much time in this culture

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
being driven and aggressive,

169
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I spend a lot of time being those things too.

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And compassion can also have those qualities.

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But again and again, lived compassion

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Jean Vanier says

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that his work,

175
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
like the work of other people --

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --

177
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is never in the first instance about changing the world;

178
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.

179
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He's says that what they do with L'Arche

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is not a solution, but a sign.

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Compassion is rarely a solution,

182
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but it is always a sign of a deeper reality,

183
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of deeper human possibilities.

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And compassion is unleashed

185
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in wider and wider circles

186
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
by signs and stories,

187
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
never by statistics and strategies.

188
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We need those things too,

189
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but we're also bumping up against their limits.

190
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And at the same time that we are doing that,

191
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I think we are rediscovering the power of story --

192
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that as human beings, we need stories

193
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to survive, to flourish,

194
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to change.

195
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Our traditions have always known this,

196
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart

197
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and carried them forward in time for us.

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
There is, of course, a story

199
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
behind the key moral longing

200
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and commandment of Judaism

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to repair the world -- tikkun olam.

202
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I'll never forget hearing that story

203
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,

204
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,

205
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that in the beginning of the Creation

206
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
something happened

207
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and the original light of the universe

208
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
was shattered into countless pieces.

209
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It lodged as shards

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
inside every aspect of the Creation.

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And that the highest human calling

212
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,

213
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to gather it up,

214
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and in so doing, to repair the world.

215
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.

216
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.

217
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Rachel Naomi Remen says

218
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
this is an important and empowering story

219
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
for our time,

220
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because this story insists

221
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that each and every one of us,

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
frail and flawed as we may be,

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
inadequate as we may feel,

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
has exactly what's needed

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to help repair the part of the world

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that we can see and touch.

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Stories like this,

228
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
signs like this,

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are practical tools

230
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in a world longing to bring compassion

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to abundant images of suffering

232
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that can otherwise overwhelm us.

233
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Rachel Naomi Remen

234
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is actually bringing compassion

235
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
back to its rightful place alongside science

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in her field of medicine

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in the training of new doctors.

238
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And this trend

239
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
how these kinds of virtues

241
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --

242
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the work Fred Luskin is doing --

243
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I think this is one of the most fascinating developments

244
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of the 21st century --

245
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that science, in fact,

246
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is taking a virtue like compassion

247
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
definitively out of the realm of idealism.

248
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is going to change science, I believe,

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and it will change religion.

250
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But here's a face

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
from 20th century science

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that might surprise you

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in a discussion about compassion.

254
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We all know about the Albert Einstein

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who came up with E = mc2.

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We don't hear so much about the Einstein

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,

258
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton

259
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because the best hotel there

260
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
was segregated and wouldn't have her.

261
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity

262
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to advocate for political prisoners in Europe

263
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or the Scottsboro boys

264
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in the American South.

265
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Einstein believed deeply

266
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that science should transcend

267
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
national and ethnic divisions.

268
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But he watched physicists and chemists

269
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction

270
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in the early 20th century.

271
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He once said that science in his generation

272
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
had become like a razor blade

273
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in the hands of a three-year-old.

274
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And Einstein foresaw

275
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that as we grow more modern

276
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and technologically advanced,

277
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we need the virtues

278
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
our traditions carry forward in time

279
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
more, not less.

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.

281
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Some of his favorites were Moses,

282
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,

283
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.

284
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And Einstein said --

285
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and I think this is a quote,

286
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
again, that has not been passed down in his legacy --

287
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that "these kinds of people

288
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are geniuses in the art of living,

289
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
more necessary

290
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to the dignity, security and joy of humanity

291
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
than the discoverers of objective knowledge."

292
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now invoking Einstein

293
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth

294
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,

295
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but actually it is.

296
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I want to show you

297
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the rest of this photograph,

298
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because this photograph

299
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture --

300
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we clean it up

301
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and we diminish its depths and its grounding

302
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in life, which is messy.

303
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So in this photograph

304
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
you see a mind looking out a window

305
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.

306
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is the full photograph,

307
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,

308
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
smoking a cigar.

309
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And by the look of that paunch,

310
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
he hasn't been doing enough yoga.

311
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,

312
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and someone said, "When I look at the first photo,

313
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I ask myself, what was he thinking?

314
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And when I look at the second, I ask,

315
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"

316
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Well, he was complicated.

317
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
He was incredibly compassionate

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in some of his relationships

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and terribly inadequate in others.

320
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And it is much harder, often,

321
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to be compassionate towards those closest to us,

322
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which is another quality in the universe of compassion,

323
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
on its dark side,

324
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that also deserves our serious attention and illumination.

325
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.

326
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.

327
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So was Mother Teresa.

328
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So are we all.

329
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And I want to say

330
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that it is a liberating thing

331
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion --

332
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
following on what Fred Luskin says --

333
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that these flaws just make us human.

334
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Our culture is obsessed with perfection

335
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and with hiding problems.

336
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But what a liberating thing to realize

337
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that our problems, in fact,

338
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
are probably our richest sources

339
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,

340
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
towards bringing compassion

341
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
towards the suffering and joys of others.

342
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor

343
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.

344
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Einstein became a humanitarian,

345
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
not because of his exquisite knowledge

346
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of space and time and matter,

347
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.

348
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say

349
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that it was some of your very wounding experiences

350
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in a religious life that,

351
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
with a zigzag,

352
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
have led to the Charter for Compassion.

353
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood

354
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
any more than it can be reduced to pity.

355
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So I want to propose

356
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
a final definition of compassion --

357
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way --

358
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and that would be for us

359
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to call compassion a spiritual technology.

360
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now our traditions contain

361
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
vast wisdom about this,

362
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and we need them to mine it for us now.

363
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But compassion is also equally at home

364
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
in the secular as in the religious.

365
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing

366
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and say that humanity,

367
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the future of humanity,

368
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
needs this technology

369
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
as much as it needs all the others

370
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that have now connected us

371
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and set before us

372
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the terrifying and wondrous possibility

373
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
of actually becoming one human race.

374
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Thank you.

375
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.401,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Riding a wave is like suddenly gaining speed

3
0:00:16.331,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and gliding at the same time.

4
0:00:18.761,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Like walking on water, like flying.

5
0:00:21.601,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I think it's really about being one with a natural phenomenon.

6
0:00:27.067,000 --> 0:00:29,000
[Small thing. Big idea.]

7
0:00:32.808,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The surfboard requires a lot of ergonomic thinking.

8
0:00:35.451,000 --> 0:00:37,000
How do I stand on it? How do I not slip off?

9
0:00:37.991,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But at the same time,

10
0:00:39.181,000 --> 0:00:41,000
it really has to work in that fluid environment.

11
0:00:41.491,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's really considered for the rider in some areas

12
0:00:45.031,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and for water and physics in others.

13
0:00:47.42,000 --> 0:00:49,000
A surfboard is made out of a core element

14
0:00:49.492,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which tends to be foam, which makes the board float,

15
0:00:52.431,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the skin of the board is some kind of resin,

16
0:00:55.881,000 --> 0:00:57,000
epoxy, sometimes fiberglass.

17
0:00:58.051,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There often is also a stringer,

18
0:00:59.924,000 --> 0:01:,000
a wood piece down the middle,

19
0:01:01.447,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which makes it stronger.

20
0:01:03.141,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The rocker is the curvature of the board in the front.

21
0:01:06.661,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That is important because that determines

22
0:01:09.451,000 --> 0:01:12,000
what kind of wave you will be able to take,

23
0:01:12.501,000 --> 0:01:13,000
how steep the wave is.

24
0:01:13.921,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The tail affects performance.

25
0:01:15.401,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Different tails will make the board react differently,

26
0:01:17.981,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so it's a lot about personal preference.

27
0:01:20.501,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Our understanding of surfing

28
0:01:21.955,000 --> 0:01:25,000
comes from when the Tahitians in 1200 AD brought it to Hawaii.

29
0:01:26.621,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So when James Cook arrived around 1780,

30
0:01:29.331,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he was mesmerized by hundreds of people in the water,

31
0:01:33.151,000 --> 0:01:36,000
children, women, men, surfing naked.

32
0:01:36.391,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Calvinist missionaries arrive

33
0:01:38.161,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they're scandalized by it.

34
0:01:40.391,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It becomes an illegal activity.

35
0:01:42.961,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It becomes counterculture.

36
0:01:44.842,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The father of modern surfing is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku.

37
0:01:48.571,000 --> 0:01:5,000
He is an extraordinary swimmer,

38
0:01:50.911,000 --> 0:01:52,000
wins gold at the Olympics in 1912.

39
0:01:53.611,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Goes around the world to show his swimming

40
0:01:56.301,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but brings surfboards and demonstrates surfing.

41
0:01:59.481,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Imagine, people had never seen surfing before.

42
0:02:01.771,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Suddenly, some person from a faraway place

43
0:02:04.545,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is standing on water, riding on water.

44
0:02:06.881,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He comes back to Hawaii,

45
0:02:08.401,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and they start to make more boards.

46
0:02:10.601,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Pre-Second World War,

47
0:02:11.971,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you're still looking at big, heavy wood boards.

48
0:02:14.751,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Post-Second World War,

49
0:02:15.931,000 --> 0:02:17,000
new materials and new technologies become available,

50
0:02:18.781,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and those make the board lighter, more accessible, cheaper,

51
0:02:22.578,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but it continues to be a custom object,

52
0:02:24.871,000 --> 0:02:26,000
something that is made specifically for a person

53
0:02:27.361,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or for a certain spot.

54
0:02:28.562,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's a very symbiotic relationship

55
0:02:30.711,000 --> 0:02:31,000
between surfer and shaper.

56
0:02:32.701,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There's so many different criteria

57
0:02:34.531,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that affect the physics of how that surfboard

58
0:02:37.861,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is moving in water.

59
0:02:39.901,000 --> 0:02:41,000
A longboard is typically used on smaller waves.

60
0:02:42.891,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The riding has a lot of style.

61
0:02:44.751,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You can walk the board,

62
0:02:46.241,000 --> 0:02:48,000
put your toes over it, do a hang ten.

63
0:02:48.711,000 --> 0:02:49,000
A shortboard will be faster.

64
0:02:50.621,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They're harder to ride, they sink under the body.

65
0:02:53.181,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Board design comes at the intersection between those physical factors,

66
0:02:57.291,000 --> 0:03:,000
and really, how I want to put myself in the water.

67
0:03:01.101,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's an expression as much as it is a physical activity.

68
0:03:05.341,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The draw may be because water is so elusive.

69
0:03:07.981,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You can't fight it, you can't change it.

70
0:03:10.601,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The best I can do is recognize what it does.

71
0:03:14.071,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The surf may be big and getting bigger

72
0:03:16.791,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and surging while you're in the water.

73
0:03:18.701,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The elements are changing.

74
0:03:19.964,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The wind is coming up.

75
0:03:21.171,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You have to be in symbiosis with the environment.

76
0:03:24.191,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You need to look and feel for everything

77
0:03:26.861,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that's happening around you.

78
0:03:28.711,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And yet, it's so short.

79
0:03:30.311,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Five, eight, 15 seconds.

80
0:03:32.691,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's fleeting, but you have to go back to it.

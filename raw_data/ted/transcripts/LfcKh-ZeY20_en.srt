Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello everyone,

3
0:00:14.571,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and welcome back to TEDConnects.

4
0:00:16.159,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If you're (Audio feedback)

5
0:00:17.462,000 --> 0:00:18,000
joining us for the --

6
0:00:18.83,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you're joining us for the first time,

7
0:00:20.784,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we've been bringing interviews all week with some of the world's greatest minds

8
0:00:24.551,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to help us make sense of this unprecedented moment that we're living in.

9
0:00:28.033,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm Whitney Pennington Rodgers, TED's current affairs curator

10
0:00:30.933,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and one of your hosts.

11
0:00:32.3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This week,

12
0:00:33.482,000 --> 0:00:35,000
thousands of you have tuned in to these live events each day,

13
0:00:36.378,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and hundreds of thousands more have watched these interviews

14
0:00:39.335,000 --> 0:00:4,000
after the fact.

15
0:00:40.517,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We've really loved seeing your questions. They add so much to these conversations.

16
0:00:44.43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So please keep them coming.

17
0:00:45.786,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In a few minutes, I'm going to disappear to work with our team behind the scenes

18
0:00:49.599,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to monitor our Facebook feed,

19
0:00:51.036,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where you can leave some of your questions.

20
0:00:53.083,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I'll work to figure out which ones are the ones

21
0:00:55.384,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that we can bring back to our guest,

22
0:00:57.267,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I will ask as many of them as I can during the live interview.

23
0:01:00.866,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Today, we're going to be touching on a subject that I think is top of mind

24
0:01:04.413,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for a lot of people,

25
0:01:05.622,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so I'd like to turn things over to the head of TED, Chris Anderson,

26
0:01:09.195,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who will introduce today's guest.

27
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Chris Anderson: Hello.

28
0:01:17.517,000 --> 0:01:19,000
WPR: Hi Chris. How's it going today?

29
0:01:20.009,000 --> 0:01:21,000
CA: Nice to see you again, Whitney.

30
0:01:21.726,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's going pretty good here. Amazing days.

31
0:01:25.075,000 --> 0:01:28,000
WPR: That's good. That's great. We have sunshine here in the Northeast,

32
0:01:28.464,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is nice.

33
0:01:30.701,000 --> 0:01:33,000
CA: So look, I am excited to introduce this guest,

34
0:01:34.643,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because I've known Seth Berkley for a long time.

35
0:01:37.407,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I count him as a friend.

36
0:01:39.984,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He's a man who has really devoted his life

37
0:01:44.374,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to the most profound questions about public health.

38
0:01:49.263,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Vaccines are extraordinary.

39
0:01:51.947,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They save millions of lives.

40
0:01:54.991,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The quest for a coronavirus vaccine

41
0:01:57.859,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is, I think, the biggest single question that the world faces now

42
0:02:02.346,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if we're going to get out of this.

43
0:02:04.847,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So it's just a delight to welcome Dr. Seth Berkley

44
0:02:10.165,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to TED Connects.

45
0:02:13.405,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Come on in, Seth.

46
0:02:16.54,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Seth Berkley: Good to see you there, Chris,

47
0:02:18.781,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and delighted to be with you and all of the TED community.

48
0:02:23.981,000 --> 0:02:25,000
CA: Well, so look, on Tuesday, Bill Gates was here,

49
0:02:26.699,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and he mentioned that your organization, Gavi,

50
0:02:30.012,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is really at the heart of the quest for a vaccine.

51
0:02:35.67,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So tell us a bit -- what is Gavi?

52
0:02:41.316,000 --> 0:02:42,000
SB: So Chris, thank you for that.

53
0:02:43.279,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What's interesting is that 20 years ago --

54
0:02:45.937,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we just celebrated our 20th anniversary --

55
0:02:48.209,000 --> 0:02:52,000
there were all these powerful new vaccines that were being used in wealthy countries,

56
0:02:53.228,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the challenge is,

57
0:02:54.423,000 --> 0:02:57,000
they weren't getting to the places that they could make the most difference:

58
0:02:58.084,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the developing world.

59
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So Gavi was formed as an alliance --

60
0:03:01.008,000 --> 0:03:07,000
WHO, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF -- all working together

61
0:03:07.136,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to try to bring these vaccines to the developing world.

62
0:03:10.685,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it's been very successful.

63
0:03:12.279,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We've launched 433 new vaccines

64
0:03:15.385,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the most difficult countries in the world,

65
0:03:17.562,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in the Somalias and Yemens and DRCs and Nigerias.

66
0:03:21.634,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But we've also set up emergency stockpiles for outbreak-based vaccines,

67
0:03:27.141,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so if there's an outbreak anywhere in the world

68
0:03:29.403,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of yellow fever or of things like cholera or meningitis and now Ebola,

69
0:03:34.962,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we have vaccines that are available to do that.

70
0:03:38.016,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the last thing we are trying to do is build the health systems out

71
0:03:42.82,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to deliver these vaccines,

72
0:03:44.875,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but also to make sure that we can pay attention to new diseases that pop up

73
0:03:49.526,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in different parts of the world.

74
0:03:51.809,000 --> 0:03:53,000
CA: And just give us a sense of the scale of this.

75
0:03:54.238,000 --> 0:03:57,000
How many vaccines do you distribute in a given year?

76
0:03:57.391,000 --> 0:04:,000
And how many lives do you believe that that may be saving?

77
0:04:01.716,000 --> 0:04:03,000
SB: So, let me give you a macro number.

78
0:04:04.179,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We've immunized more than 760 million additional children --

79
0:04:11.193,000 --> 0:04:13,000
760 million additional children --

80
0:04:13.235,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and prevented more than 13 million deaths.

81
0:04:15.975,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In an average year, we give about a half a billion doses

82
0:04:20.484,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because we started out with six diseases,

83
0:04:22.952,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but now we vaccinate against 18 different diseases.

84
0:04:28.573,000 --> 0:04:3,000
CA: Yeah, the scale of that is incredible,

85
0:04:30.62,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and amidst all the bad news that's happening,

86
0:04:33.153,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it's kind of amazing that this intervention can save so many lives.

87
0:04:39.897,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I mean, help us understand what a vaccine is.

88
0:04:44.992,000 --> 0:04:46,000
SB: So, the original idea, the word "vaccine,"

89
0:04:47.675,000 --> 0:04:49,000
comes from "vaca," or cow.

90
0:04:49.849,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the observation made in the 1700s

91
0:04:52.213,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was that milkmaids had beautiful skin,

92
0:04:54.684,000 --> 0:04:58,000
whereas everybody else had pockmarks from having gotten over smallpox.

93
0:04:59.474,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the concept was that she was getting infected with a zoonosis,

94
0:05:03.794,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that is, with naturally occurring cowpox,

95
0:05:06.664,000 --> 0:05:07,000
not smallpox.

96
0:05:07.965,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That then protected against smallpox.

97
0:05:10.612,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it was tested in those days: Could you artificially do that?

98
0:05:15.246,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They of course didn't understand virology,

99
0:05:17.315,000 --> 0:05:19,000
they didn't understand any of those issues.

100
0:05:19.549,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But what a vaccine is is something that you give

101
0:05:22.452,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to artificially stimulate the immune system,

102
0:05:25.384,000 --> 0:05:26,000
hopefully to not make you sick.

103
0:05:27.168,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But then later on, when the body comes in contact with the real disease,

104
0:05:31.616,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it thinks it's already seen it and it is able to fight it off

105
0:05:35.149,000 --> 0:05:37,000
without making the person sick.

106
0:05:38.791,000 --> 0:05:4,000
CA: I mean, it's kind of a miraculous thing to me

107
0:05:41.153,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that they work that way,

108
0:05:42.341,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that your body is always there looking for these threats.

109
0:05:46.666,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And a vaccine, I guess, the body perceives it as a threat,

110
0:05:50.219,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and therefore arms itself against that threat, right?

111
0:05:55.092,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And that's what gives the protection.

112
0:05:57.748,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, is that why some people are sort of -- irrationally, I will say --

113
0:06:02.862,000 --> 0:06:04,000
irrationally scared of vaccines

114
0:06:04.89,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and feel that they may be dangerous,

115
0:06:06.809,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because they are a kind of threat that you're putting into your body

116
0:06:10.042,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in a very subtle way?

117
0:06:12.163,000 --> 0:06:14,000
SB: Well, of course, when this first started,

118
0:06:14.412,000 --> 0:06:15,000
there were two ways to make vaccines.

119
0:06:16.241,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You could grind them up and inject them,

120
0:06:19.39,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so-called "whole killed vaccines."

121
0:06:21.568,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So you took organisms and you got an immune response,

122
0:06:24.66,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and sometimes those organisms, even though they were dead,

123
0:06:27.731,000 --> 0:06:29,000
gave you a pretty whopping immune response:

124
0:06:29.77,000 --> 0:06:31,000
your arms were sore, you got fevers.

125
0:06:32.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Then we moved to these weakened live viruses,

126
0:06:35.919,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and frankly, those are the best vaccines.

127
0:06:37.937,000 --> 0:06:38,000
That's what measles is.

128
0:06:39.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That's what yellow fever is.

129
0:06:40.528,000 --> 0:06:41,000
These are weakened viruses.

130
0:06:42.202,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They don't give you disease,

131
0:06:44.22,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but because they look like the natural viruses,

132
0:06:46.983,000 --> 0:06:5,000
your body gets protection and, frankly, you get protection for your whole life.

133
0:06:51.763,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Today, because people are worried about side effects,

134
0:06:54.277,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we've begun to use molecular biology and use little bits of it,

135
0:06:57.821,000 --> 0:07:,000
and therefore, it's moved forward.

136
0:07:01.05,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But the reason people are mostly scared

137
0:07:03.355,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is because, frankly, vaccines have been so successful.

138
0:07:06.153,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You don't expect, if you have a child or two children,

139
0:07:08.737,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that those children are going to die of these diseases,

140
0:07:11.384,000 --> 0:07:16,000
unlike in the past, when three or four out of your five or six or seven kids

141
0:07:16.421,000 --> 0:07:17,000
would die.

142
0:07:17.607,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So today, people think, well, gee, these diseases aren't around,

143
0:07:20.676,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they're not that bad and, by the way, if I'm injecting these things,

144
0:07:24.325,000 --> 0:07:27,000
maybe they're not organic, maybe it'll make my child cry,

145
0:07:27.367,000 --> 0:07:29,000
maybe it'll make them sick, and I don't need to do it.

146
0:07:30.098,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And that's the challenge.

147
0:07:31.353,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You don't want to scare people to death on how bad these diseases can be,

148
0:07:34.979,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but at the same time,

149
0:07:36.545,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you want them to understand that these diseases are serious

150
0:07:39.417,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and can cause really bad disease and sequela.

151
0:07:44.758,000 --> 0:07:48,000
CA: So yesterday, you issued a really powerful call

152
0:07:49.157,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for this massive, coordinated global response

153
0:07:52.701,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to tackle the search for a coronavirus vaccine.

154
0:07:57.299,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We're going to come that in a bit,

155
0:07:58.957,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because I think that's a very exciting topic.

156
0:08:03.1,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But I think we need some more background first.

157
0:08:05.334,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I want to go back five years to when you stood on the TED stage

158
0:08:08.354,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and you held up two candidate Ebola vaccines.

159
0:08:13.05,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This was just a few months after Ebola had been terrifying the world.

160
0:08:17.889,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It was basically amazing how quickly those vaccines had been developed.

161
0:08:24.314,000 --> 0:08:25,000
What happened to them?

162
0:08:26.961,000 --> 0:08:27,000
SB: It's a great question,

163
0:08:28.406,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and let me tell a little bit of the story,

164
0:08:30.458,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but at the end, there were two vaccines.

165
0:08:32.976,000 --> 0:08:34,000
One, it turned out, couldn't finish its testing,

166
0:08:35.997,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because the epidemic died down.

167
0:08:38.376,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The other one was fully tested.

168
0:08:40.613,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It had a hundred percent efficacy.

169
0:08:42.982,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We then went on to work with manufacturers to produce that vaccine,

170
0:08:48.285,000 --> 0:08:49,000
at least temporarily,

171
0:08:50.223,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in an investigational form, just in case there were more outbreaks.

172
0:08:53.901,000 --> 0:08:55,000
There were, and those are the vaccine doses

173
0:08:56.444,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that we've used in the DRC.

174
0:08:58.614,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In the last two outbreaks,

175
0:09:00.551,000 --> 0:09:05,000
280,000 people have been vaccinated with this experimental vaccine,

176
0:09:06.35,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and today, there is a licensed vaccine,

177
0:09:09.184,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we are now procuring a global stockpile of a half a million doses.

178
0:09:16.998,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But let me just say, Chris,

179
0:09:19.749,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the reason they came so quickly at that moment is, after September 11th,

180
0:09:26.737,000 --> 0:09:29,000
there was concern in the US about bioterrorism.

181
0:09:30.701,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Remember, there were anthrax attacks.

182
0:09:32.52,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And so what happened was there was a list of agents,

183
0:09:34.99,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and Ebola, for a short time, was on that list of agents,

184
0:09:37.672,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so people started making vaccines,

185
0:09:39.472,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and later on, they decided that was not necessarily a good bioterrorism agent,

186
0:09:44.446,000 --> 0:09:46,000
so they dropped that off the list.

187
0:09:46.632,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But in the freezers were vaccines that had been started,

188
0:09:50.194,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and they were dusted off,

189
0:09:51.433,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and that's why we could move so quickly in that moment.

190
0:09:54.412,000 --> 0:09:57,000
CA: And yet, how long was it from that moment on the TED stage

191
0:09:57.831,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with the candidate vaccine

192
0:09:59.361,000 --> 0:10:,000
to actual deployment?

193
0:10:02.294,000 --> 0:10:03,000
SB: So, what happened was,

194
0:10:03.585,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the epidemic began to go down.

195
0:10:06.452,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The clinical trial I told you about was done.

196
0:10:08.629,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It was a heroic clinical trial done by WHO,

197
0:10:11.881,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and it showed that it had these results.

198
0:10:13.969,000 --> 0:10:14,000
That epidemic then stopped.

199
0:10:15.334,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We didn't know if there were going to be more epidemics.

200
0:10:18.004,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It took another number of years to finish the work on the vaccine

201
0:10:22.59,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to make sure it was pure,

202
0:10:23.87,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to figure out how to manufacture it at scale.

203
0:10:26.04,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's during that period that we put vaccine away

204
0:10:29.469,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and had it available in case there were other outbreaks.

205
0:10:32.127,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And it turned out, there were three outbreaks.

206
0:10:34.317,000 --> 0:10:36,000
One went away quickly, but there were two.

207
0:10:36.383,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I was there on day 13 of the second outbreak.

208
0:10:38.646,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We injected the vaccine, cases went up, then they went down, and controlled it.

209
0:10:42.607,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And then this DRC in North Kivu outbreak,

210
0:10:45.46,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which really was terrible because it was in a war zone.

211
0:10:48.365,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And that's the one where we've been not only vaccinating in DRC

212
0:10:51.906,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but in surrounding countries.

213
0:10:53.579,000 --> 0:10:59,000
By the way, that is now, I believe, day 38 or 39 out of the 42 necessary

214
0:10:59.868,000 --> 0:11:,000
to say it's over.

215
0:11:01.106,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We hope it is.

216
0:11:02.292,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And that would be, again, an enormous example

217
0:11:05.155,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of what vaccines can do, even in a very difficult setting.

218
0:11:09.375,000 --> 0:11:11,000
CA: And yet, in one way, Seth, it's kind of shocking

219
0:11:13.141,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that the outbreak that happened at the start of 2015, end of 2014,

220
0:11:19.283,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that it happened at all,

221
0:11:20.482,000 --> 0:11:22,000
because the world has known about Ebola for a long time.

222
0:11:23.367,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's been sequenced and so forth.

223
0:11:25.475,000 --> 0:11:29,000
A vaccine could have been developed and got ready for a possible outbreak.

224
0:11:30.179,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Why didn't that happen?

225
0:11:33.229,000 --> 0:11:35,000
SB: Well, there had been 26 outbreaks before,

226
0:11:36.083,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but each one of them was small --

227
0:11:37.881,000 --> 0:11:39,000
couple of hundred people or a couple of dozen people --

228
0:11:40.833,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in the poorest African countries in the world.

229
0:11:43.238,000 --> 0:11:44,000
There was no market for it.

230
0:11:44.812,000 --> 0:11:45,000
People didn't know how to test it

231
0:11:46.449,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because they would just pop up and then go away.

232
0:11:48.74,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And so even though it was obviously a disease that potentially could spread,

233
0:11:53.476,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it had never really spread before.

234
0:11:55.152,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Of course, in West Africa,

235
0:11:56.469,000 --> 0:11:58,000
they didn't have a good surveillance system;

236
0:11:58.615,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it spread for three months before people identified that it was Ebola,

237
0:12:02.23,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and by that time, it was too late.

238
0:12:03.89,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It had spread.

239
0:12:05.072,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What's important about that lesson

240
0:12:07.674,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is that then caused huge disruption across Africa, across the world,

241
0:12:12.427,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because cases went to other places.

242
0:12:14.473,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And the challenge then was, and the reason we had to step in,

243
0:12:18.878,000 --> 0:12:2,000
was because there still was no market.

244
0:12:21.294,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So the Gavi board said,

245
0:12:22.729,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"We will put out 390 million dollars.

246
0:12:25.901,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We'll put it out there and tell companies, we're open for business,

247
0:12:29.114,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we'll create a market, we'll buy the vaccine."

248
0:12:31.39,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And that led to companies being willing to finish the investment

249
0:12:35.928,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to get us to where we are today.

250
0:12:38.275,000 --> 0:12:39,000
CA: Right, right.

251
0:12:39.608,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So it's a real paradox, right?

252
0:12:41.092,000 --> 0:12:44,000
In a way, the very thing that makes vaccines so extraordinary,

253
0:12:44.402,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that once they're developed, they are so cheap to administer,

254
0:12:49.199,000 --> 0:12:52,000
for a few dollars, I guess, you can administer this dose

255
0:12:53.019,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that will save someone maybe a lifetime of illness

256
0:12:55.588,000 --> 0:12:56,000
or save their lives,

257
0:12:56.902,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and yet so much of medical research and invention and development

258
0:13:02.386,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is done by companies who need to see a revenue stream,

259
0:13:06.651,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and so they don't see it from those tiny little cheap things

260
0:13:09.946,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that might save a lot of lives.

261
0:13:11.709,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So it's a real market failure that in this circumstance now --

262
0:13:15.552,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That's one of the things I guess you're thinking hard about,

263
0:13:18.442,000 --> 0:13:2,000
how on earth do we get round and avoid that market failure

264
0:13:21.243,000 --> 0:13:22,000
crippling the response this time?

265
0:13:23.486,000 --> 0:13:26,000
SB: Well, first of all, one of the reasons Bill Gates likes vaccines is,

266
0:13:26.966,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in a sense, it's a little bit like software creation.

267
0:13:29.48,000 --> 0:13:31,000
You put a lot of money and effort into creating it,

268
0:13:31.923,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but once you've got it, you can produce it pretty cheaply

269
0:13:34.63,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and use it in different places around the world.

270
0:13:36.895,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I don't want to beat up the pharmaceutical industry here

271
0:13:39.566,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because they were heroic in Ebola,

272
0:13:41.246,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but I think realistically, they are for-profit entities,

273
0:13:44.563,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and they have to say to their shareholders,

274
0:13:46.613,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"Somebody's going to pay for this,

275
0:13:48.288,000 --> 0:13:5,000
or we're going to do it as a charitable thing."

276
0:13:50.518,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And if we do it as a charitable thing, they can't keep doing it.

277
0:13:53.57,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Since then, there is a new initiative

278
0:13:55.403,000 --> 0:13:58,000
called CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

279
0:13:58.784,000 --> 0:14:,000
It was set up at Davos a few years ago,

280
0:14:01.267,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and its purpose is to try to make vaccines

281
0:14:04.116,000 --> 0:14:08,000
for the list of diseases that aren't yet known epidemics

282
0:14:08.47,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but that can potentially be there.

283
0:14:10.83,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And the idea would be using public sector money

284
0:14:13.692,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to get us prepared.

285
0:14:14.877,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Of course, they jumped in on this coronavirus as well.

286
0:14:17.992,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Last thing is, of course,

287
0:14:19.329,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I'm not worried on a coronavirus stage that this is a problem,

288
0:14:24.574,000 --> 0:14:25,000
with not having a market.

289
0:14:25.79,000 --> 0:14:28,000
One of the challenges here is that there may be too big a market for this,

290
0:14:29.506,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and therefore, how do we make sure there's access for developing countries.

291
0:14:33.423,000 --> 0:14:35,000
CA: All right, so talk about this virus, Seth.

292
0:14:35.611,000 --> 0:14:37,000
How is it different from Ebola?

293
0:14:38.071,000 --> 0:14:39,000
How challenging is it

294
0:14:39.535,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to create a vaccine for it?

295
0:14:43.002,000 --> 0:14:45,000
SB: So what's interesting about coronaviruses

296
0:14:45.916,000 --> 0:14:46,000
is that they are animal viruses,

297
0:14:47.909,000 --> 0:14:48,000
probably primarily in bats.

298
0:14:49.528,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They jump into other animals sometimes,

299
0:14:51.72,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and then they jump into humans.

300
0:14:53.266,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So this shouldn't have been a surprise.

301
0:14:55.584,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is the third coronavirus that has jumped into humans.

302
0:14:59.76,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We had SARS in early 2002,

303
0:15:03.058,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we had MERS a number of years later,

304
0:15:06.351,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and now we have this virus.

305
0:15:08.726,000 --> 0:15:09,000
What's interesting is there is a database

306
0:15:10.714,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that shows there are 30,000-some-odd isolated coronaviruses in animals,

307
0:15:16.033,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and one of the things that people tried to do

308
0:15:18.175,000 --> 0:15:21,000
was say the way these coronaviruses work is they have a spike on them.

309
0:15:21.561,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They're called "corona" because they look like the sun.

310
0:15:24.178,000 --> 0:15:28,000
That spike is where it attaches to a certain receptor in people's lungs.

311
0:15:28.643,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And so somebody said, well, maybe we can begin to look at those spikes

312
0:15:31.987,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and see if they're similar to the human receptors

313
0:15:34.447,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and they can be predicted.

314
0:15:35.732,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But the problem is people don't invest in those types of research.

315
0:15:40.035,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And, of course, I think that,

316
0:15:42.144,000 --> 0:15:44,000
given it's an evolutionary certainty, we're going to see this,

317
0:15:45.151,000 --> 0:15:46,000
that we should be.

318
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
But one other point about this is

319
0:15:48.036,000 --> 0:15:5,000
coronavirus jumped into humans in ancient history as well,

320
0:15:50.915,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and so we have now about a third to a quarter of the common cold viruses

321
0:15:55.423,000 --> 0:15:56,000
are actually coronaviruses.

322
0:15:57.13,000 --> 0:16:,000
And what's interesting about those is they don't make you deathly ill

323
0:16:00.432,000 --> 0:16:01,000
like these,

324
0:16:01.624,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but you also don't have long-term immunity to them,

325
0:16:04.073,000 --> 0:16:06,000
so you can get reinfected with these viruses

326
0:16:06.167,000 --> 0:16:09,000
after 10 months, a year.

327
0:16:09.479,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And so that does raise an issue on vaccinology,

328
0:16:12.714,000 --> 0:16:15,000
because you want to ideally have lifetime immunity.

329
0:16:16.426,000 --> 0:16:2,000
CA: The reason why we get reinfected is because the virus mutates slightly,

330
0:16:20.511,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and so it escapes the antibodies?

331
0:16:22.611,000 --> 0:16:24,000
SB: No, no, not in this case.

332
0:16:24.825,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Not in this case.

333
0:16:26.348,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So in flu, that's what happens. The viruses are always mutating.

334
0:16:29.648,000 --> 0:16:32,000
In HIV, the reason we don't have a vaccine is because they're all mutating.

335
0:16:33.323,000 --> 0:16:37,000
In this case, the immune response seems to get weaker and go away,

336
0:16:38.313,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and people get reinfected with the same viruses.

337
0:16:40.664,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Now, that is potentially a solvable problem using vaccinology

338
0:16:44.687,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and many different techniques,

339
0:16:46.614,000 --> 0:16:48,000
but the point is, we just can't assume.

340
0:16:48.9,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Some people now are talking about herd immunity

341
0:16:51.591,000 --> 0:16:53,000
as a way to deal with this virus,

342
0:16:53.973,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and the idea there is if you could get enough people infected --

343
0:16:57.468,000 --> 0:17:,000
you know, forget for a moment that a lot of people are going to die

344
0:17:00.685,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and be miserable while that happens --

345
0:17:02.542,000 --> 0:17:05,000
but the idea is that you get a certain level immunity in the community,

346
0:17:05.92,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and then the disease will go away.

347
0:17:07.578,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Well, that is only true if you get long-term immunity.

348
0:17:10.334,000 --> 0:17:13,000
If you don't, then you could go through all of that horrible experience,

349
0:17:13.96,000 --> 0:17:14,000
have all those deaths,

350
0:17:15.229,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and then not have the protection you need to protect against this disease.

351
0:17:19.771,000 --> 0:17:21,000
CA: OK, so in a way, the quest we're looking for

352
0:17:22.354,000 --> 0:17:25,000
is a vaccine that will work for the long term.

353
0:17:26.342,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I mean, I guess any vaccine that works at all will be a huge gift,

354
0:17:30.576,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but it could well be one that we have to retake every year,

355
0:17:33.942,000 --> 0:17:34,000
or something like that.

356
0:17:35.307,000 --> 0:17:36,000
SB: Right. That is certainly possible.

357
0:17:37.168,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Of course, we have to remember, though,

358
0:17:39.092,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that SARS and MERS both had even higher mortality than this virus does,

359
0:17:43.867,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and they give a much more profound immune response.

360
0:17:46.527,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So it may be that they react differently than the common cold viruses.

361
0:17:51.515,000 --> 0:17:54,000
The challenge, of course, is that we haven't had the opportunity

362
0:17:54.781,000 --> 0:17:55,000
to study these over a long time,

363
0:17:56.391,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and this new disease -- three and a half months, we've had it.

364
0:17:59.352,000 --> 0:18:01,000
More science has been done for this disease

365
0:18:01.587,000 --> 0:18:02,000
in this short period of time,

366
0:18:03.136,000 --> 0:18:06,000
but we don't understand fully the epidemiology of the virus,

367
0:18:06.32,000 --> 0:18:09,000
the immune response, what's protective, which is the best animal model.

368
0:18:10.333,000 --> 0:18:15,000
All of that is being worked on by science and at breakneck pace,

369
0:18:16.11,000 --> 0:18:18,000
but a lot to learn.

370
0:18:18.298,000 --> 0:18:24,000
CA: So talk about how the medical and the research community responded.

371
0:18:24.591,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Because, the Chinese authorities -- I guess we heard it yesterday --

372
0:18:28.725,000 --> 0:18:31,000
only found out about this sometime in December.

373
0:18:32.061,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Already, early in January --

374
0:18:34.746,000 --> 0:18:37,000
I think the virus started in November, they found out about it in December --

375
0:18:38.688,000 --> 0:18:42,000
by early January, they had already released a sequence of the virus

376
0:18:43.021,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to the world,

377
0:18:44.233,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and now here we are.

378
0:18:45.508,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And I think I saw that more than 40 companies

379
0:18:48.186,000 --> 0:18:51,000
are already claiming candidate vaccines.

380
0:18:51.86,000 --> 0:18:53,000
What does it mean to have a candidate vaccine?

381
0:18:54.44,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Like, have companies tested this already against animals or something?

382
0:18:58.21,000 --> 0:19:,000
Or are they just looking at a computer model where they go,

383
0:19:01.069,000 --> 0:19:02,000
"That should work"?

384
0:19:03.266,000 --> 0:19:05,000
SB: Well, it's an interesting question you ask there.

385
0:19:05.902,000 --> 0:19:07,000
So first of all, China was heroic on this.

386
0:19:07.982,000 --> 0:19:1,000
They did post the genetic sequence of it.

387
0:19:11.49,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Today, we have companies that can sit down with a computer

388
0:19:15.054,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and from that genetic sequence, make what is a candidate vaccine.

389
0:19:19.112,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Now, a candidate vaccine obviously means it's not a licensed product.

390
0:19:22.656,000 --> 0:19:24,000
It's something that somebody wants to work on.

391
0:19:24.904,000 --> 0:19:26,000
But you're right, you have to have the right nomenclature,

392
0:19:27.718,000 --> 0:19:3,000
because "candidate" can mean I'm working on something, it's in my head,

393
0:19:31.615,000 --> 0:19:34,000
I'm just doing a little work on it, I've got something in a vial,

394
0:19:34.946,000 --> 0:19:36,000
I'm beginning to do testing on it.

395
0:19:37.021,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And so what we saw in that case was a company called Moderna.

396
0:19:41.308,000 --> 0:19:43,000
That was the first vaccine that went into humans.

397
0:19:44.047,000 --> 0:19:46,000
It's a messenger RNA-based system.

398
0:19:46.252,000 --> 0:19:49,000
I actually visited the company, not in this outbreak but before,

399
0:19:49.777,000 --> 0:19:5,000
because the technology is interesting.

400
0:19:51.792,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And what they were able to do was, in 42 days,

401
0:19:54.591,000 --> 0:19:56,000
make a candidate vaccine from the genetic sequence.

402
0:19:57.475,000 --> 0:19:58,000
They didn't need the organism.

403
0:19:59.063,000 --> 0:20:,000
That now is in clinical testing.

404
0:20:00.921,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Now, there is no licensed mRNA vaccine, so we're going to have to figure out,

405
0:20:06.574,000 --> 0:20:07,000
is it safe?

406
0:20:07.749,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Does it work in different age groups? How are we going to scale it up?

407
0:20:11.096,000 --> 0:20:12,000
All of that.

408
0:20:12.278,000 --> 0:20:15,000
But there are many others who are using conventional vaccinology.

409
0:20:15.564,000 --> 0:20:19,000
An example would be, the French are working on a measles-based vaccine.

410
0:20:20.029,000 --> 0:20:24,000
The idea is to put the spiked protein in the measles vector,

411
0:20:24.227,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and it takes a little bit longer to do that work,

412
0:20:26.781,000 --> 0:20:3,000
but once you have that done, of course, we know how to make measles vaccine.

413
0:20:31.271,000 --> 0:20:35,000
We make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of doses

414
0:20:35.841,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and provide it to the whole world.

415
0:20:37.527,000 --> 0:20:4,000
If that was to work, that might be easier to scale up.

416
0:20:41.247,000 --> 0:20:45,000
So I think what we want in the race is to have multiple different vaccines

417
0:20:46.153,000 --> 0:20:47,000
moving forward.

418
0:20:47.365,000 --> 0:20:48,000
We don't want one or two.

419
0:20:49.228,000 --> 0:20:51,000
We don't want a hundred in the late stages,

420
0:20:51.648,000 --> 0:20:52,000
because it's expensive and hard to do.

421
0:20:53.496,000 --> 0:20:56,000
But we want to have a diversity of science approaches going forward.

422
0:20:58.162,000 --> 0:21:01,000
CA: Which of the other candidates out there are you excited by

423
0:21:01.564,000 --> 0:21:02,000
or at least intrigued by?

424
0:21:03.589,000 --> 0:21:04,000
SB: Well, for me,

425
0:21:04.846,000 --> 0:21:08,000
the critical issue here is going to be we have to optimize for speed,

426
0:21:09.576,000 --> 0:21:1,000
and so that means, as I said,

427
0:21:11.168,000 --> 0:21:14,000
having examples of all the different new technologies

428
0:21:14.312,000 --> 0:21:15,000
that could potentially work,

429
0:21:15.865,000 --> 0:21:18,000
as well as conventional doses moving forward at the same time.

430
0:21:19.751,000 --> 0:21:22,000
So what you're going to want to do is have this bubble up.

431
0:21:23.159,000 --> 0:21:25,000
And it's not just companies, or big companies.

432
0:21:26.052,000 --> 0:21:27,000
It's also biotech companies.

433
0:21:27.633,000 --> 0:21:29,000
It's also academic researchers that are working on this.

434
0:21:30.522,000 --> 0:21:31,000
You want all of those to bubble up.

435
0:21:32.251,000 --> 0:21:36,000
Then you want to be able to look at what's the most promising,

436
0:21:36.845,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and that will depend upon animal results.

437
0:21:39.648,000 --> 0:21:41,000
It'll depend upon being able to produce those vaccines,

438
0:21:42.258,000 --> 0:21:43,000
have a pathway,

439
0:21:43.56,000 --> 0:21:46,000
and eventually, you will want to put those into human clinical trials.

440
0:21:47.466,000 --> 0:21:49,000
That requires a certain amount of safety work.

441
0:21:50.07,000 --> 0:21:51,000
You can try to accelerate that.

442
0:21:51.814,000 --> 0:21:52,000
But then you need to say, OK,

443
0:21:53.834,000 --> 0:21:56,000
we need to know, do we need one dose, do we need multiple doses,

444
0:21:57.631,000 --> 0:22:,000
do we need 50 micrograms, 100, 150?

445
0:22:01.185,000 --> 0:22:03,000
Do we need a chemical stimulant we call an adjuvant?

446
0:22:04,000 --> 0:22:05,000
Given that this disease,

447
0:22:05.666,000 --> 0:22:1,000
its big problems in outcomes are in the elderly,

448
0:22:11.005,000 --> 0:22:15,000
we might need to put some stimulants in to make it a more potent immune response.

449
0:22:15.449,000 --> 0:22:18,000
So all of that work has to go on. That's what the clinical testing is.

450
0:22:18.831,000 --> 0:22:21,000
Eventually you say, "Aha! Here's the vaccine we're going to use."

451
0:22:22.22,000 --> 0:22:24,000
Now you test it in an efficacy trial.

452
0:22:24.769,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And that is to see, does it work?

453
0:22:26.655,000 --> 0:22:28,000
And at that point,

454
0:22:28.885,000 --> 0:22:3,000
you then have a vaccine that you know works.

455
0:22:30.985,000 --> 0:22:31,000
But there is a stage after that,

456
0:22:32.779,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and that stage is, you've got to work out the manufacturing,

457
0:22:37.264,000 --> 0:22:39,000
have it all worked out so that the regulators know

458
0:22:40.102,000 --> 0:22:41,000
that you can really make this,

459
0:22:41.883,000 --> 0:22:44,000
and that it's pure, it doesn't have any problems with it.

460
0:22:45.368,000 --> 0:22:48,000
And during that period, and that's what we did in Ebola,

461
0:22:48.732,000 --> 0:22:51,000
we were able to use those vaccines to help in outbreaks

462
0:22:52.605,000 --> 0:22:55,000
under a clinical trial protocol while monitoring them and learning.

463
0:22:55.982,000 --> 0:22:58,000
So there's a lot of steps there, and it's complicated,

464
0:22:59.157,000 --> 0:23:,000
and I've shortened it a little bit.

465
0:23:00.908,000 --> 0:23:03,000
CA: But summarize the steps that they basically need to go through.

466
0:23:04.145,000 --> 0:23:07,000
I heard probably an animal test,

467
0:23:07.212,000 --> 0:23:08,000
and then --

468
0:23:08.387,000 --> 0:23:1,000
SB: Well, for example, Moderna.

469
0:23:10.988,000 --> 0:23:13,000
They went into humans at the same time they're doing animal testing.

470
0:23:14.491,000 --> 0:23:15,000
We don't have a perfect animal model.

471
0:23:16.369,000 --> 0:23:19,000
But normally it takes 10 to 15 years to do this,

472
0:23:20.119,000 --> 0:23:22,000
and that's the compression you're trying to do here.

473
0:23:22.578,000 --> 0:23:26,000
So the challenge is, we can compress all those different clinical trials.

474
0:23:26.733,000 --> 0:23:29,000
The basic way you think about it is, preclinical studies, animals,

475
0:23:30.415,000 --> 0:23:33,000
understanding it, purity, reproducibility.

476
0:23:33.845,000 --> 0:23:35,000
Then you move into human studies.

477
0:23:36.241,000 --> 0:23:38,000
You start off with a small number of healthy people.

478
0:23:38.739,000 --> 0:23:4,000
You then work on the dosing, how much, how often.

479
0:23:41.746,000 --> 0:23:43,000
Then you move into people at risk for the disease --

480
0:23:44.273,000 --> 0:23:47,000
that might be in this case the elderly or people with other conditions --

481
0:23:47.763,000 --> 0:23:49,000
and then eventually do an efficacy trial.

482
0:23:50.025,000 --> 0:23:52,000
Now, one of the cool new things we can do today

483
0:23:52.287,000 --> 0:23:54,000
is something called "adaptive trial design."

484
0:23:54.803,000 --> 0:23:57,000
So rather than do these sequentially,

485
0:23:58.028,000 --> 0:23:59,000
what you can begin to do is enroll people

486
0:24:00.035,000 --> 0:24:01,000
and then, as you get the data you need,

487
0:24:01.927,000 --> 0:24:04,000
you can just begin to bring in the next set of groups,

488
0:24:05.83,000 --> 0:24:07,000
and by doing that, you can speed it up dramatically.

489
0:24:09.029,000 --> 0:24:1,000
CA: When you say enroll people,

490
0:24:10.843,000 --> 0:24:13,000
you mean enroll people who have their eyes wide open.

491
0:24:13.981,000 --> 0:24:15,000
They have informed consent. I think that's the term.

492
0:24:16.743,000 --> 0:24:17,000
SB: Absolutely.

493
0:24:18.496,000 --> 0:24:21,000
CA: And they're willing to, I guess, take the risk

494
0:24:21.981,000 --> 0:24:25,000
that this isn't a fully tested vaccine but it may well be efficacious,

495
0:24:27.004,000 --> 0:24:31,000
and so that obviously can help a lot.

496
0:24:31.105,000 --> 0:24:33,000
That's crucial to this, right?

497
0:24:33.642,000 --> 0:24:36,000
SB: Absolutely. They are the unsung heroes of vaccinology,

498
0:24:37.383,000 --> 0:24:4,000
because people go out, they volunteer to take a substance,

499
0:24:40.521,000 --> 0:24:43,000
particularly early on, that don't know how it's going to react.

500
0:24:43.746,000 --> 0:24:45,000
Is it going to make the disease worse? Make it better?

501
0:24:46.312,000 --> 0:24:48,000
Is it going to protect them? Is it going to make them sick?

502
0:24:49.105,000 --> 0:24:51,000
So you try to predict that if you can with animals,

503
0:24:51.861,000 --> 0:24:54,000
but people do do that, and the informed consent says

504
0:24:54.915,000 --> 0:24:57,000
not only you may have these side effects or these problems,

505
0:24:58.221,000 --> 0:25:,000
but also this vaccine may not work.

506
0:25:00.283,000 --> 0:25:03,000
And so it's important for people to understand that,

507
0:25:03.508,000 --> 0:25:06,000
because you don't want people to go and put themselves at high risk,

508
0:25:06.771,000 --> 0:25:08,000
saying, "Oh, gee, I had a vaccine, and so I'm protected."

509
0:25:09.501,000 --> 0:25:12,000
We don't know that until we get to the efficacy stage of trials.

510
0:25:12.851,000 --> 0:25:14,000
CA: But Seth, even putting together all those dots,

511
0:25:15.444,000 --> 0:25:17,000
what I've heard most people say

512
0:25:17.97,000 --> 0:25:19,000
is that it is likely to take at least 18 months

513
0:25:20.875,000 --> 0:25:23,000
before the world will have a vaccine available

514
0:25:24.195,000 --> 0:25:26,000
at any kind of scale.

515
0:25:26.933,000 --> 0:25:28,000
Is that time line right?

516
0:25:29.302,000 --> 0:25:33,000
And can the world remotely afford 18 months on this?

517
0:25:33.761,000 --> 0:25:36,000
SB: Well, I think, you know, I've given you many questions.

518
0:25:37.214,000 --> 0:25:39,000
I could raise lots more questions.

519
0:25:39.478,000 --> 0:25:4,000
So part of it's going to be luck:

520
0:25:41.137,000 --> 0:25:45,000
How easy is this particular candidate vaccine going to be?

521
0:25:45.669,000 --> 0:25:48,000
How lucky will we be in getting a good immune response?

522
0:25:49.082,000 --> 0:25:51,000
Which approaches will work? Will they be scalable?

523
0:25:51.914,000 --> 0:25:53,000
So I think there's lot of questions there.

524
0:25:54.318,000 --> 0:25:57,000
The world will do everything they can to squeeze it down,

525
0:25:57.59,000 --> 0:26:,000
but I think that's the time line we're talking about.

526
0:26:00.741,000 --> 0:26:03,000
And remember, it's 10 to 15 years usually.

527
0:26:04.051,000 --> 0:26:07,000
In the case of Ebola, we did it in five years to a licensed product.

528
0:26:07.969,000 --> 0:26:1,000
In this case, we are hoping to squeeze it down dramatically,

529
0:26:11.454,000 --> 0:26:14,000
but there are many things we're going to have to go through,

530
0:26:14.771,000 --> 0:26:18,000
and it's really about making sure that vaccine works and it is safe for use

531
0:26:19.648,000 --> 0:26:21,000
in what ultimately may be billions of people.

532
0:26:23.148,000 --> 0:26:24,000
CA: Whitney.

533
0:26:24.554,000 --> 0:26:26,000
WPR: Hi. So we have lots of questions coming in, Seth.

534
0:26:27.301,000 --> 0:26:29,000
One of them that's kind of related to this is, you know,

535
0:26:30.168,000 --> 0:26:31,000
a lot of us right now are isolating,

536
0:26:32.114,000 --> 0:26:34,000
and we're not building our exposure to this virus,

537
0:26:34.77,000 --> 0:26:36,000
so how will that affect us in the long term?

538
0:26:37.639,000 --> 0:26:42,000
Will this make us vulnerable to the virus until a vaccine is available?

539
0:26:43.734,000 --> 0:26:44,000
SB: So that's a great question,

540
0:26:45.462,000 --> 0:26:47,000
and, as you know,

541
0:26:47.785,000 --> 0:26:49,000
we don't fully understand the epidemiology of this virus,

542
0:26:50.505,000 --> 0:26:52,000
but there is some sense that there may be asymptomatics.

543
0:26:53.466,000 --> 0:26:54,000
Do they get immune protection?

544
0:26:55.365,000 --> 0:26:58,000
Are they afterwards resistant to infection?

545
0:26:58.946,000 --> 0:27:,000
We don't know that, but we do know that people do get sick,

546
0:27:01.969,000 --> 0:27:02,000
including young people,

547
0:27:03.483,000 --> 0:27:05,000
and that sickness can be quite severe.

548
0:27:05.621,000 --> 0:27:08,000
Obviously, a lot of it is mild, but some of it is quite severe,

549
0:27:08.655,000 --> 0:27:1,000
and then it gets more severe in the elderly.

550
0:27:10.833,000 --> 0:27:13,000
So I wouldn't recommend that anybody go out

551
0:27:13.89,000 --> 0:27:16,000
and intentionally try to get exposed to this virus now.

552
0:27:17.232,000 --> 0:27:19,000
The whole idea of having isolation now

553
0:27:19.534,000 --> 0:27:22,000
is to try to stop the chains of transmission,

554
0:27:22.849,000 --> 0:27:24,000
protect health workers in hospitals,

555
0:27:25.221,000 --> 0:27:28,000
with the idea being that if you can suppress it enough --

556
0:27:28.248,000 --> 0:27:29,000
and Bill talked about this in his talk --

557
0:27:30.224,000 --> 0:27:32,000
and later on have testing available,

558
0:27:32.26,000 --> 0:27:35,000
you might be able to go back to somewhat of a normal life

559
0:27:35.724,000 --> 0:27:38,000
and then watch for reintroduction of this virus.

560
0:27:39.187,000 --> 0:27:41,000
Of course, at the end of the day,

561
0:27:41.756,000 --> 0:27:44,000
we will probably need a vaccine to be able to completely control that,

562
0:27:45.476,000 --> 0:27:46,000
but the experiment is going on,

563
0:27:47.426,000 --> 0:27:48,000
in China ...

564
0:27:48.624,000 --> 0:27:5,000
Japan has done an amazing job of controlling this

565
0:27:51.141,000 --> 0:27:54,000
with slightly less severe interventions.

566
0:27:54.73,000 --> 0:27:56,000
We've seen in Korea similar things.

567
0:27:57.473,000 --> 0:28:,000
So the hope would be that if we take it seriously,

568
0:28:00.701,000 --> 0:28:06,000
we actually damp down the exposures and stop this epidemic now,

569
0:28:07.033,000 --> 0:28:1,000
we'll be able to remove to some form of normalcy.

570
0:28:10.229,000 --> 0:28:11,000
And we also may have drugs,

571
0:28:11.812,000 --> 0:28:13,000
and drugs will change the dynamics as well,

572
0:28:13.911,000 --> 0:28:16,000
because people will then know that they are able to get treatment as well.

573
0:28:18.856,000 --> 0:28:21,000
WPR: Great. I'll be back later with other questions I'm seeing.

574
0:28:21.972,000 --> 0:28:22,000
SB: Thanks, Whitney.

575
0:28:22.987,000 --> 0:28:23,000
CA: Thanks, Whitney.

576
0:28:23.987,000 --> 0:28:25,000
Thanks everyone watching. Keep those questions coming.

577
0:28:27.104,000 --> 0:28:3,000
Seth, this time line, I've been puzzled about this,

578
0:28:30.998,000 --> 0:28:32,000
because I get that there are so many things

579
0:28:33.045,000 --> 0:28:35,000
that have to be checked out,

580
0:28:35.779,000 --> 0:28:37,000
but I still worry

581
0:28:38.206,000 --> 0:28:43,000
that the rules are not adapting rapidly enough

582
0:28:43.676,000 --> 0:28:44,000
for the scale of the emergency.

583
0:28:45.396,000 --> 0:28:48,000
I mean, my analogy would be: you're going about your lives,

584
0:28:48.491,000 --> 0:28:5,000
and suddenly there's this emergency,

585
0:28:51.113,000 --> 0:28:54,000
you see that there's this enemy force approaching you from the horizon

586
0:28:54.45,000 --> 0:28:55,000
and coming your direction.

587
0:28:55.882,000 --> 0:29:,000
You don't, in that circumstance, spend a week trying to test all your guns

588
0:29:01.187,000 --> 0:29:04,000
and make sure they're operating absolutely safely and in the right way.

589
0:29:04.567,000 --> 0:29:09,000
You galvanize and you do take some additional risk

590
0:29:09.755,000 --> 0:29:11,000
for the sake of avoiding the bigger risk.

591
0:29:12.256,000 --> 0:29:16,000
Is that thinking prevalent right now?

592
0:29:16.53,000 --> 0:29:2,000
Are there people trying to make those kinds of trade-offs?

593
0:29:20.841,000 --> 0:29:21,000
How should we think about that?

594
0:29:22.372,000 --> 0:29:25,000
Or do you really believe that the community is galvanizing

595
0:29:25.852,000 --> 0:29:27,000
and moving forward as fast as it humanly can

596
0:29:28.04,000 --> 0:29:31,000
and appropriately balancing the two risks?

597
0:29:32.178,000 --> 0:29:35,000
SB: I think we're seeing heroics in moving forward here.

598
0:29:35.872,000 --> 0:29:38,000
Obviously, you're right, and the reason we talk about going from 10 to 15 years

599
0:29:39.827,000 --> 0:29:41,000
down to something like 18 months

600
0:29:41.941,000 --> 0:29:44,000
is about squeezing those steps as much as possible.

601
0:29:45.47,000 --> 0:29:48,000
The regulators in the Ebola experience were really fabulous.

602
0:29:48.683,000 --> 0:29:49,000
They worked with us

603
0:29:50.059,000 --> 0:29:55,000
and tried to keep any bureaucratic delays down to the smallest amount possible.

604
0:29:55.774,000 --> 0:29:57,000
And I think that's what's going to be important here,

605
0:29:58.345,000 --> 0:29:59,000
is we have to look at every single step

606
0:30:00.301,000 --> 0:30:01,000
and say, "Is it critical?"

607
0:30:01.594,000 --> 0:30:04,000
But you do need to answer a lot of these questions.

608
0:30:04.764,000 --> 0:30:08,000
For example, if you have a vaccine that works in healthy people,

609
0:30:08.835,000 --> 0:30:1,000
it very well may not give an immune response to the elderly.

610
0:30:11.699,000 --> 0:30:14,000
We may need to change that vaccine to make it work there.

611
0:30:15.271,000 --> 0:30:16,000
It may not work in young children.

612
0:30:17.214,000 --> 0:30:2,000
So you need a certain amount of studies done.

613
0:30:20.682,000 --> 0:30:22,000
Of course, if you work in areas that have big outbreaks,

614
0:30:23.418,000 --> 0:30:26,000
you're able to also enroll more quickly

615
0:30:26.794,000 --> 0:30:27,000
and follow people more quickly.

616
0:30:28.362,000 --> 0:30:31,000
That's one of the reasons we'll have to think about this globally,

617
0:30:31.506,000 --> 0:30:34,000
because we don't know in 12 to 18 months,

618
0:30:34.575,000 --> 0:30:37,000
or even six to 18 months, if we're really lucky,

619
0:30:38.203,000 --> 0:30:42,000
where the epidemic will be raging and where we want to do the clinical trials.

620
0:30:42.425,000 --> 0:30:45,000
We should be prepared to do them wherever in the world it's possible,

621
0:30:45.84,000 --> 0:30:47,000
and also do some in different types of countries.

622
0:30:48.637,000 --> 0:30:5,000
Developing countries may have different immune responses

623
0:30:51.36,000 --> 0:30:52,000
than in wealthy countries.

624
0:30:52.761,000 --> 0:30:54,000
CA: What alarms me a bit

625
0:30:55.087,000 --> 0:30:57,000
is that on the models I've looked at,

626
0:30:57.425,000 --> 0:31:01,000
with the possible exception of what happened in China and Japan,

627
0:31:02.265,000 --> 0:31:08,000
by distancing, we can bend the curve, we can reduce infection.

628
0:31:09.187,000 --> 0:31:11,000
But as soon as you go back to normal,

629
0:31:11.697,000 --> 0:31:14,000
there's this huge risk of a massive resurge,

630
0:31:14.771,000 --> 0:31:18,000
and until the vaccine comes along, it feels like your choices are:

631
0:31:18.911,000 --> 0:31:22,000
one, sort of recklessly expose the whole population to the bug

632
0:31:23.231,000 --> 0:31:25,000
and develop some kind of herd immunity,

633
0:31:25.515,000 --> 0:31:31,000
or try and do this scary dance of really cramping down on the economy

634
0:31:31.743,000 --> 0:31:34,000
and all the risks that are associated with that,

635
0:31:35.062,000 --> 0:31:4,000
and risking, if you lift the lid on that, risking these really dangerous

636
0:31:40.337,000 --> 0:31:42,000
second surges.

637
0:31:42.621,000 --> 0:31:44,000
So is that the right way to think about it?

638
0:31:45.079,000 --> 0:31:47,000
There's a scenario where, until this happens,

639
0:31:47.734,000 --> 0:31:48,000
and if it's 18 months,

640
0:31:48.944,000 --> 0:31:51,000
that's an incredibly long time for the world to be

641
0:31:52.345,000 --> 0:31:55,000
in that sort of dangerous, scary dance.

642
0:31:56.48,000 --> 0:32:,000
SB: Well, I think the issue here is that is a little bit the way to think of it,

643
0:32:00.808,000 --> 0:32:01,000
but the experiment is going on now.

644
0:32:02.547,000 --> 0:32:06,000
China is now releasing its controls, and we will see what happens there.

645
0:32:07.527,000 --> 0:32:09,000
We'll see where they have to clamp back down

646
0:32:09.722,000 --> 0:32:1,000
and what's going to happen,

647
0:32:11.192,000 --> 0:32:13,000
and we'll get a good idea of what that's like.

648
0:32:13.428,000 --> 0:32:16,000
Right now, in many countries, we're still in the upscale period

649
0:32:16.867,000 --> 0:32:17,000
when we're seeing lots of cases.

650
0:32:18.482,000 --> 0:32:2,000
And so we have to break that transmission first

651
0:32:20.76,000 --> 0:32:22,000
before we can have that conversation.

652
0:32:23.046,000 --> 0:32:26,000
I'm the first person that would like a vaccine to occur quicker,

653
0:32:27.017,000 --> 0:32:33,000
and, of course, my job is to underpromise and overdeliver,

654
0:32:34.037,000 --> 0:32:35,000
not the other way around.

655
0:32:35.292,000 --> 0:32:37,000
And I think we have to be careful not to think about,

656
0:32:38.036,000 --> 0:32:4,000
"Oh, we can just have a vaccine in a couple of months."

657
0:32:40.697,000 --> 0:32:42,000
It may be that we're lucky. It may be that it's easy to do.

658
0:32:43.558,000 --> 0:32:45,000
It may be the first few candidates will show promise,

659
0:32:46.143,000 --> 0:32:49,000
we get efficacy, we can scale those up for at least some limited use

660
0:32:49.907,000 --> 0:32:5,000
while it's being worked out.

661
0:32:51.563,000 --> 0:32:54,000
But a lot of things have to fall in place for that to happen.

662
0:32:54.934,000 --> 0:32:56,000
And that's why we want to have an organized, global effort

663
0:32:57.881,000 --> 0:33:01,000
to absolutely incentivize the best possible chance

664
0:33:02.121,000 --> 0:33:03,000
for that to happen in the fastest way.

665
0:33:04.701,000 --> 0:33:05,000
CA: There's some kind of debate out there

666
0:33:06.723,000 --> 0:33:09,000
about whether there might be way, way more cases,

667
0:33:10.636,000 --> 0:33:14,000
mild cases, basically zero-symptom cases of coronavirus out there

668
0:33:15.473,000 --> 0:33:19,000
that may have granted more people immunity than we know.

669
0:33:19.994,000 --> 0:33:22,000
Is that a credible suggestion?

670
0:33:23.328,000 --> 0:33:25,000
More cases and much lower fatality rate than we know,

671
0:33:25.929,000 --> 0:33:27,000
because so many of the cases could be invisible?

672
0:33:28.856,000 --> 0:33:31,000
SB: You know, Mayor Bloomberg used to have a saying that I loved.

673
0:33:31.969,000 --> 0:33:33,000
He said, "In God we trust. Everybody else, bring data."

674
0:33:34.75,000 --> 0:33:38,000
And I think the answer here is we haven't done enough testing to know,

675
0:33:39.168,000 --> 0:33:42,000
and we started out with PCR tests to look for virus,

676
0:33:42.316,000 --> 0:33:45,000
and therefore, if you had recovered, didn't have the virus anymore,

677
0:33:45.601,000 --> 0:33:46,000
we weren't able to pick it up.

678
0:33:47.076,000 --> 0:33:49,000
Now there are beginning to be antibody tests

679
0:33:49.233,000 --> 0:33:51,000
to look to see if you've been exposed

680
0:33:51.279,000 --> 0:33:54,000
and don't have the virus now but have an immune response to it.

681
0:33:54.538,000 --> 0:33:57,000
Once we have those tests operating at scale,

682
0:33:57.599,000 --> 0:33:59,000
we'll be able to understand what the epidemiology is

683
0:34:00.182,000 --> 0:34:01,000
and what's happening,

684
0:34:01.356,000 --> 0:34:05,000
and then we'll be in a much better place to understand how this is playing out.

685
0:34:05.625,000 --> 0:34:06,000
Also, I mean, even the question:

686
0:34:07.486,000 --> 0:34:08,000
We don't see a lot of cases in children --

687
0:34:09.49,000 --> 0:34:12,000
is that because the children get infected but they don't get symptoms,

688
0:34:12.818,000 --> 0:34:14,000
and therefore they might be potential spreaders?

689
0:34:15.17,000 --> 0:34:18,000
Or, is it because those children don't get it at all?

690
0:34:20.154,000 --> 0:34:24,000
CA: So tell us, Seth, about this call that you issued yesterday.

691
0:34:24.667,000 --> 0:34:28,000
I mean, you've said that scientists are behaving heroically.

692
0:34:29.318,000 --> 0:34:32,000
But you've called for something more here

693
0:34:32.773,000 --> 0:34:35,000
from both scientists, companies, governments.

694
0:34:35.859,000 --> 0:34:36,000
Tell us what your call is.

695
0:34:38.483,000 --> 0:34:41,000
SB: So, first of all, I believe that, given the situation here,

696
0:34:41.744,000 --> 0:34:44,000
this is not the time to just let the normal system work,

697
0:34:45.382,000 --> 0:34:46,000
as we've talked about.

698
0:34:46.718,000 --> 0:34:49,000
I think we have to think about vaccines as a global public good.

699
0:34:50.23,000 --> 0:34:54,000
And what that means is that initially, it ought to be public sector financed.

700
0:34:54.424,000 --> 0:34:57,000
Obviously, if others want to contribute resources,

701
0:34:57.591,000 --> 0:34:59,000
I believe they should, fine.

702
0:34:59.945,000 --> 0:35:01,000
But we want to make sure the best approaches come,

703
0:35:02.471,000 --> 0:35:04,000
and it doesn't matter where they come from in the world.

704
0:35:05.258,000 --> 0:35:09,000
We want to make sure if the best approach is in China or Japan or in South Korea

705
0:35:09.741,000 --> 0:35:13,000
or in the US, wherever it comes from, whatever company has the ideas,

706
0:35:14.242,000 --> 0:35:15,000
get them on the table.

707
0:35:15.75,000 --> 0:35:17,000
Then we want a process to say, realistically,

708
0:35:18.504,000 --> 0:35:2,000
how are these being compared?

709
0:35:20.824,000 --> 0:35:23,000
How do we decide which ones are most likely to succeed?

710
0:35:24.405,000 --> 0:35:27,000
And then, as I explained, some diversity in taking those risks.

711
0:35:28.166,000 --> 0:35:32,000
Maybe some new technology, some old technologies to drive forward.

712
0:35:32.791,000 --> 0:35:35,000
Once that happens, then, to try to get clinical trials

713
0:35:35.873,000 --> 0:35:36,000
to drive forward as quickly as possible.

714
0:35:37.859,000 --> 0:35:41,000
Now, the delay here is actually likely to be in manufacturing,

715
0:35:42.353,000 --> 0:35:46,000
because we might want billions and billions of doses,

716
0:35:46.741,000 --> 0:35:51,000
so how do we then begin to invest, at risk, in manufacturing plants?

717
0:35:52.014,000 --> 0:35:55,000
If it's a big company, they may have adequate manufacturing,

718
0:35:55.288,000 --> 0:35:57,000
but we may want to work with contract manufacturers,

719
0:35:57.907,000 --> 0:36:,000
other companies, or even build plants or use new technologies,

720
0:36:01.816,000 --> 0:36:02,000
modular technologies to do this.

721
0:36:03.745,000 --> 0:36:05,000
And then, of course, at the end is going to be the process

722
0:36:06.532,000 --> 0:36:08,000
of getting the vaccine out to all those who need it,

723
0:36:09.019,000 --> 0:36:12,000
and that's going to need to be dependent upon the risk at that time.

724
0:36:12.938,000 --> 0:36:13,000
CA: Help me understand this better, Seth,

725
0:36:14.935,000 --> 0:36:17,000
because right now, it feels like there's this huge effort going on,

726
0:36:18.118,000 --> 0:36:21,000
but companies are operating, in a way, competitively with each other.

727
0:36:21.631,000 --> 0:36:25,000
To an extent, countries are operating competitively with each other.

728
0:36:26.455,000 --> 0:36:31,000
Are you saying that what the world needs is some kind of widely supported

729
0:36:31.6,000 --> 0:36:33,000
global -- I don't know -- vaccine czar

730
0:36:34.005,000 --> 0:36:36,000
that is pulling together different efforts,

731
0:36:36.546,000 --> 0:36:4,000
coordinating, encouraging everyone to work together for the common good,

732
0:36:41.032,000 --> 0:36:44,000
and trying to get agreement on these big decisions

733
0:36:44.664,000 --> 0:36:47,000
like what are the smart few candidates to get behind,

734
0:36:48.524,000 --> 0:36:5,000
rather than this confusing explosion?

735
0:36:51.158,000 --> 0:36:54,000
And then, how do we coordinate manufacturing, etc?

736
0:36:54.565,000 --> 0:36:57,000
Like, is that a person or a small organization

737
0:36:58.404,000 --> 0:37:01,000
that some combination of governments, WHO, UN needs to put together?

738
0:37:02.724,000 --> 0:37:05,000
SB: So, first of all, you want science to bubble up at the beginning.

739
0:37:06.158,000 --> 0:37:09,000
You don't want to have centralized control,

740
0:37:09.396,000 --> 0:37:11,000
somebody saying, "I know best and I'm going to predict this."

741
0:37:12.326,000 --> 0:37:14,000
So you want it bubbling up from all over the place,

742
0:37:14.785,000 --> 0:37:15,000
but then you want a coordinated effort.

743
0:37:16.671,000 --> 0:37:19,000
The group that is best-placed to do that is the World Health Organization,

744
0:37:20.386,000 --> 0:37:23,000
maintaining a list of all the different programs that are going on.

745
0:37:24.013,000 --> 0:37:27,000
We also have other organizations. I mentioned CEPI before.

746
0:37:27.327,000 --> 0:37:29,000
CEPI has now supported eight different candidates.

747
0:37:30.036,000 --> 0:37:32,000
I think it's going to support more.

748
0:37:32.72,000 --> 0:37:35,000
Right now, WHO has on its list 44 candidates,

749
0:37:35.881,000 --> 0:37:37,000
but some people think as many as double that.

750
0:37:38.462,000 --> 0:37:41,000
So what you want to do is say, which are the most likely to succeed,

751
0:37:42.251,000 --> 0:37:47,000
and then put them through some type of standardized set of criteria

752
0:37:47.662,000 --> 0:37:5,000
to pick a few of them to move forward aggressively for the world.

753
0:37:51.624,000 --> 0:37:53,000
Obviously, science is going to keep moving,

754
0:37:53.727,000 --> 0:37:54,000
they're going to keep changing,

755
0:37:55.245,000 --> 0:37:59,000
and it may be that your original approach isn't right and new ideas may come up,

756
0:38:00.091,000 --> 0:38:04,000
but you do need to have some process of moving this forward.

757
0:38:04.19,000 --> 0:38:05,000
And really, that's what I called for.

758
0:38:05.996,000 --> 0:38:09,000
What we need to make sure is that if companies have adequate resources

759
0:38:10.531,000 --> 0:38:11,000
to do this on their own,

760
0:38:11.835,000 --> 0:38:12,000
that's fine,

761
0:38:13.016,000 --> 0:38:15,000
but if not, they need to be supported by the public sector

762
0:38:15.78,000 --> 0:38:19,000
and, again, making sure there's adequate manufacturing and ultimately distribution.

763
0:38:19.997,000 --> 0:38:21,000
Then, after a period of time, we can go back to normal

764
0:38:22.833,000 --> 0:38:26,000
and return to the normal way vaccines are handled.

765
0:38:27.023,000 --> 0:38:3,000
But I think that's probably the best way to get there.

766
0:38:31.463,000 --> 0:38:34,000
CA: How much might this cost, and who should pay for it?

767
0:38:36.375,000 --> 0:38:38,000
SB: Well, it depends how many cases there are.

768
0:38:38.605,000 --> 0:38:44,000
The good news is, we're talking now about trillions of dollars in economic loss,

769
0:38:44.765,000 --> 0:38:45,000
and this is going to be --

770
0:38:46.081,000 --> 0:38:47,000
CA: I would hardly call that good news.

771
0:38:48.017,000 --> 0:38:52,000
SB: I mean, I'm making the comparison. Sorry, you're absolutely right, Chris.

772
0:38:52.13,000 --> 0:38:55,000
I mean, we're talking about tens of billions of dollars here,

773
0:38:55.982,000 --> 0:38:58,000
not trillions of dollars, and the reason that's important is

774
0:38:59.778,000 --> 0:39:03,000
you want to make sure that any good idea has its best chance of moving forward,

775
0:39:04.014,000 --> 0:39:08,000
and we ought to, again, optimize for speed

776
0:39:08.545,000 --> 0:39:11,000
and not optimize for being cost-effective at this time.

777
0:39:12.434,000 --> 0:39:16,000
CA: So I guess you're saying that, like,

778
0:39:16.824,000 --> 0:39:19,000
the rich countries may well be able to afford some kind of vaccine program.

779
0:39:20.402,000 --> 0:39:23,000
I think what I hear you doing here is representing a lot of the countries

780
0:39:23.908,000 --> 0:39:24,000
that can't afford it,

781
0:39:25.096,000 --> 0:39:27,000
and what you're saying is that the world may have to find a way

782
0:39:28.095,000 --> 0:39:29,000
of spending tens of billions of dollars

783
0:39:30.006,000 --> 0:39:32,000
to avoid trillions of dollars of economic damage

784
0:39:32.409,000 --> 0:39:34,000
and all the hardship that goes with it around the world.

785
0:39:35.057,000 --> 0:39:36,000
Is that about right?

786
0:39:36.939,000 --> 0:39:39,000
SB: That's absolutely right, but I think the important point is,

787
0:39:39.982,000 --> 0:39:41,000
this needs to be a global perspective.

788
0:39:42.076,000 --> 0:39:43,000
I mean, look at what happened with Ebola.

789
0:39:44.071,000 --> 0:39:46,000
We had a vaccine that was originally made in Canada

790
0:39:46.491,000 --> 0:39:47,000
by the Public [Health] Agency of Canada.

791
0:39:48.444,000 --> 0:39:51,000
It was then transferred to a US biotech, then to Merck and Company,

792
0:39:52.177,000 --> 0:39:54,000
which is obviously a global player based in the US,

793
0:39:54.601,000 --> 0:39:55,000
and they're manufacturing it in Germany.

794
0:39:56.581,000 --> 0:39:57,000
That's the way science works,

795
0:39:58.053,000 --> 0:40:01,000
and these vaccines may need components from other places.

796
0:40:01.173,000 --> 0:40:04,000
So how do we think about this in a global way and make sure that --

797
0:40:04.922,000 --> 0:40:06,000
By the way, the second vaccine that's in humans is from China.

798
0:40:07.906,000 --> 0:40:11,000
Of course, they've had a lot of time to work on it compared to some others.

799
0:40:12.228,000 --> 0:40:14,000
And they have a candidate that's moving forward.

800
0:40:14.613,000 --> 0:40:15,000
If that candidate is successful,

801
0:40:16.203,000 --> 0:40:18,000
we want to make sure that's the one that's scaled up.

802
0:40:18.737,000 --> 0:40:22,000
And so for me, it's making sure that we're looking at this

803
0:40:23.008,000 --> 0:40:25,000
as a global ecosystem

804
0:40:25.134,000 --> 0:40:28,000
with the best candidates moving forward for the good of the world.

805
0:40:29.087,000 --> 0:40:3,000
CA: Whitney.

806
0:40:30.762,000 --> 0:40:32,000
WPR: We have a lot of people watching from all over the world

807
0:40:33.646,000 --> 0:40:34,000
and we're seeing questions,

808
0:40:34.975,000 --> 0:40:36,000
especially from some of our friends in India who are watching,

809
0:40:37.9,000 --> 0:40:38,000
connected to this just basically about

810
0:40:39.852,000 --> 0:40:42,000
how are poor nations going to get access to this vaccine?

811
0:40:43.391,000 --> 0:40:46,000
And then, specifically, when we think about who gets the vaccine first,

812
0:40:47.271,000 --> 0:40:51,000
will there be some sort of payment that people are paying for this vaccine

813
0:40:51.963,000 --> 0:40:54,000
and those who can afford it will get access before others?

814
0:40:56.275,000 --> 0:40:58,000
SB: Well, the decision on who will pay for it

815
0:40:58.415,000 --> 0:41:,000
will ultimately come from the political leaders,

816
0:41:00.716,000 --> 0:41:03,000
and my recommendation would be, you start off as a global public good,

817
0:41:04.137,000 --> 0:41:07,000
you make the vaccine available because we're trying to stop the epidemic.

818
0:41:07.666,000 --> 0:41:09,000
Later on, we can have tiered pricing in different places.

819
0:41:10.427,000 --> 0:41:12,000
But one of the concerns, of course, is:

820
0:41:12.788,000 --> 0:41:14,000
Where is the epidemic going to be at that point,

821
0:41:15.135,000 --> 0:41:16,000
and who needs it first?

822
0:41:16.31,000 --> 0:41:19,000
I would argue that people that will need it first are probably health workers,

823
0:41:20.046,000 --> 0:41:22,000
because health workers are going to be on the front lines

824
0:41:22.772,000 --> 0:41:24,000
and we want them to be there to be able to take care of people.

825
0:41:25.773,000 --> 0:41:28,000
They're at risk of both contracting it as well as spreading it.

826
0:41:28.797,000 --> 0:41:31,000
Then you probably want to think about the high-risk individuals,

827
0:41:31.955,000 --> 0:41:33,000
the elderly, people who have preexisting conditions,

828
0:41:34.735,000 --> 0:41:37,000
and then eventually, the rest of the population, if it's needed.

829
0:41:38.418,000 --> 0:41:4,000
So having some type of way of thinking about that.

830
0:41:41.416,000 --> 0:41:43,000
We'll also need to be thinking about equitable access,

831
0:41:44.403,000 --> 0:41:47,000
and that is going to mean thinking about the entire world.

832
0:41:47.548,000 --> 0:41:49,000
Now, Gavi, in the past, including in India,

833
0:41:50.44,000 --> 0:41:53,000
has worked to make sure these new technologies are there,

834
0:41:53.588,000 --> 0:41:57,000
but these are vaccines that existed and, in this case, it's a new vaccine.

835
0:41:58.313,000 --> 0:42:02,000
We have to make sure that it isn't hoarded only in wealthy countries

836
0:42:03.096,000 --> 0:42:04,000
or in a select set of countries.

837
0:42:05.029,000 --> 0:42:09,000
And one way to do that would be to have vaccine production in multiple places.

838
0:42:09.054,000 --> 0:42:13,000
So today a lot of the vaccines that Gavi uses are made around the world.

839
0:42:13.521,000 --> 0:42:15,000
Some are made in the United States and Europe,

840
0:42:16,000 --> 0:42:2,000
but some are made in South Korea, in India, in China, in other countries.

841
0:42:20.884,000 --> 0:42:25,000
And so what we could do is have a vaccine transfer the technology and manufacturing

842
0:42:26.122,000 --> 0:42:27,000
in multiple different sites

843
0:42:27.622,000 --> 0:42:3,000
so we could have enough vaccine for that original launch.

844
0:42:30.849,000 --> 0:42:33,000
But whatever happens, there will always be a period of time

845
0:42:34.539,000 --> 0:42:37,000
when we'll have an exciting vaccine and not enough doses to go around,

846
0:42:38.245,000 --> 0:42:4,000
and that's when we need to take hard decisions

847
0:42:40.682,000 --> 0:42:42,000
based upon science on who should get it.

848
0:42:44.615,000 --> 0:42:47,000
WPR: Thanks for that, Seth. I'll be back later with other questions.

849
0:42:48.028,000 --> 0:42:49,000
CA: Thanks, Whitney. SB: Thank you.

850
0:42:50.294,000 --> 0:42:52,000
CA: How confident are you that we'll eventually get one?

851
0:42:52.982,000 --> 0:42:54,000
I mean, we still don't have a vaccine for HIV,

852
0:42:55.895,000 --> 0:42:57,000
nor for the common cold.

853
0:42:58.297,000 --> 0:43:,000
How can you be confident that we can get one this time?

854
0:43:01.934,000 --> 0:43:06,000
SB: Well, first of all, as you know, I did a TED Talk even before the one of 2015

855
0:43:07.5,000 --> 0:43:11,000
talking about HIV and flu and how new science needs to come in,

856
0:43:11.821,000 --> 0:43:12,000
and frankly, we are making progress

857
0:43:13.539,000 --> 0:43:15,000
against some of these incredibly difficult organisms.

858
0:43:16.532,000 --> 0:43:19,000
You talked about variability. That's the problem with HIV.

859
0:43:19.58,000 --> 0:43:22,000
It's constantly changing, and so you're chasing.

860
0:43:22.739,000 --> 0:43:23,000
You get a good immune response,

861
0:43:24.443,000 --> 0:43:26,000
but it's to the strain that was there before,

862
0:43:26.609,000 --> 0:43:27,000
and now you're chasing new strains.

863
0:43:28.323,000 --> 0:43:29,000
There are ways to work around that.

864
0:43:30.027,000 --> 0:43:31,000
It's new science.

865
0:43:31.207,000 --> 0:43:32,000
I, actually, I am optimistic.

866
0:43:33.048,000 --> 0:43:36,000
I'm optimistic because we have some experience with SARS vaccines

867
0:43:36.886,000 --> 0:43:37,000
and with MERS vaccines,

868
0:43:38.408,000 --> 0:43:39,000
and so people have worked on it.

869
0:43:40.286,000 --> 0:43:44,000
They've been able to get good immune responses in animals and in people

870
0:43:44.524,000 --> 0:43:45,000
for those vaccines.

871
0:43:45.788,000 --> 0:43:47,000
And so we can build on that experience.

872
0:43:48.651,000 --> 0:43:5,000
I can't tell you how long they'll last for,

873
0:43:51.496,000 --> 0:43:52,000
how effective they will be.

874
0:43:52.852,000 --> 0:43:55,000
Will they need to have local mucosal immunity,

875
0:43:55.954,000 --> 0:43:56,000
which is in the mouth and nose,

876
0:43:57.475,000 --> 0:44:,000
as well as serum immunity in the bloodstream?

877
0:44:00.663,000 --> 0:44:04,000
Will they need to have just antibodies or the other arm of the immune system,

878
0:44:04.725,000 --> 0:44:05,000
the cellular arm?

879
0:44:06.405,000 --> 0:44:08,000
These are questions that will need to be answered,

880
0:44:08.801,000 --> 0:44:1,000
but I am a great believer in the power of science,

881
0:44:11.596,000 --> 0:44:15,000
and I think in this case the organism is not going to be quite as difficult

882
0:44:16.183,000 --> 0:44:19,000
as the ones you're talking about that are much more difficult.

883
0:44:20.949,000 --> 0:44:22,000
CA: You mentioned in your TED Talk five years ago, Seth,

884
0:44:23.69,000 --> 0:44:26,000
that we've got this situation where we're spending billions of dollars

885
0:44:27.503,000 --> 0:44:3,000
on nuclear submarines patrolling the oceans

886
0:44:30.893,000 --> 0:44:35,000
for a possible incoming threat, nuclear war threat or whatever,

887
0:44:36.152,000 --> 0:44:42,000
and almost nothing on preparation for a pandemic like the one we're suffering.

888
0:44:43.21,000 --> 0:44:47,000
If the world is adequately shaken up by what's happening now

889
0:44:47.372,000 --> 0:44:49,000
and gets rational about this,

890
0:44:50.307,000 --> 0:44:53,000
what is the key structural shift

891
0:44:53.562,000 --> 0:44:57,000
that would be the pandemic equivalent of having those nuclear submarines?

892
0:44:57.759,000 --> 0:45:02,000
How do we prepare for a new virus

893
0:45:03.323,000 --> 0:45:05,000
that we don't know what it will be or when it will come?

894
0:45:06,000 --> 0:45:08,000
How do we prepare to have a much more rapid response?

895
0:45:10.071,000 --> 0:45:12,000
SB: Well, it's a great question and I think the TED community

896
0:45:13.004,000 --> 0:45:14,000
has a role to play here.

897
0:45:14.186,000 --> 0:45:16,000
So first of all, we need better surveillance.

898
0:45:16.331,000 --> 0:45:18,000
We need surveillance everywhere in the world,

899
0:45:18.531,000 --> 0:45:2,000
and that's why we don't want to have another outbreak

900
0:45:21.053,000 --> 0:45:22,000
like in West Africa with Ebola.

901
0:45:22.573,000 --> 0:45:24,000
You want to have a resilient health system

902
0:45:25.301,000 --> 0:45:27,000
in every country that reaches out to the periphery.

903
0:45:27.873,000 --> 0:45:28,000
And that's an important priority.

904
0:45:29.497,000 --> 0:45:31,000
We're doing pretty good with immunization.

905
0:45:31.588,000 --> 0:45:33,000
We've reached 90 percent of the kids of the world

906
0:45:34.083,000 --> 0:45:36,000
with at least one dose of routine vaccine.

907
0:45:36.119,000 --> 0:45:37,000
That's the best of health interventions.

908
0:45:38.054,000 --> 0:45:41,000
But we need to reach that last 10 percent and put that health system in place.

909
0:45:41.839,000 --> 0:45:42,000
Then we need to have a different view.

910
0:45:43.69,000 --> 0:45:44,000
We need to start working,

911
0:45:45.225,000 --> 0:45:46,000
where are our likely hot spots?

912
0:45:47.176,000 --> 0:45:49,000
It's where we're cutting down forest.

913
0:45:50.101,000 --> 0:45:53,000
It's in urban slums, where there's density of populations.

914
0:45:53.787,000 --> 0:45:54,000
It's with climate change

915
0:45:55.14,000 --> 0:45:56,000
and movement of different vectors.

916
0:45:57.16,000 --> 0:45:59,000
And what we need to do is use predictive science,

917
0:45:59.524,000 --> 0:46:,000
and that's where big data can help,

918
0:46:01.241,000 --> 0:46:04,000
that's where AI can help in terms of trying to do that.

919
0:46:04.355,000 --> 0:46:06,000
And we need to have a one-health approach,

920
0:46:06.607,000 --> 0:46:09,000
because we tend to think of animal diseases --

921
0:46:09.632,000 --> 0:46:12,000
and by the way, people have worked on coronavirus vaccines for animals,

922
0:46:13.153,000 --> 0:46:14,000
because they also cause disease there --

923
0:46:15.097,000 --> 0:46:18,000
we need to make sure that the scientists working on veterinary vaccines

924
0:46:18.466,000 --> 0:46:21,000
are connected to humans, are thinking about those whole ecosystem.

925
0:46:22.049,000 --> 0:46:23,000
And we need to invest in that.

926
0:46:23.97,000 --> 0:46:28,000
And unfortunately, after an epidemic, everybody wants to invest,

927
0:46:29.328,000 --> 0:46:31,000
and they say, "Whatever it takes,"

928
0:46:31.407,000 --> 0:46:35,000
and then we move to on other things, and investments go down.

929
0:46:36.034,000 --> 0:46:4,000
What's different about the military is that there is a baseline of investment

930
0:46:40.201,000 --> 0:46:42,000
that goes on all the time and nobody questions that.

931
0:46:43.116,000 --> 0:46:46,000
It continues, and that level of preparedness seems to be there.

932
0:46:47.071,000 --> 0:46:5,000
Bill Gates in his talk in TED, when we did that back-to-back, said,

933
0:46:51.014,000 --> 0:46:53,000
look, the military are doing war games,

934
0:46:53.07,000 --> 0:46:56,000
they're constantly testing, they have all this preparatory activities.

935
0:46:56.411,000 --> 0:46:58,000
Why are we not doing that in diseases?

936
0:46:58.732,000 --> 0:47:01,000
And, as you know, since then, there has been some war games,

937
0:47:02.296,000 --> 0:47:04,000
and they've basically said we weren't prepared,

938
0:47:04.531,000 --> 0:47:06,000
and I think we're seeing now that, in fact,

939
0:47:06.629,000 --> 0:47:07,000
we're not as prepared as we could be.

940
0:47:08.449,000 --> 0:47:13,000
So my hope, the silver lining would be that we prepare for the next big outbreak,

941
0:47:13.841,000 --> 0:47:16,000
because it's absolutely evolutionarily certain

942
0:47:16.959,000 --> 0:47:18,000
we will continue to have outbreaks.

943
0:47:19.306,000 --> 0:47:21,000
The question is: How prepared are we to deal with those?

944
0:47:23.266,000 --> 0:47:25,000
CA: As we wait for a vaccine,

945
0:47:26.151,000 --> 0:47:28,000
are there other interventions that could be made,

946
0:47:29.068,000 --> 0:47:35,000
for example, the serum from people who have been infected and have recovered?

947
0:47:36.293,000 --> 0:47:39,000
SB: So, that technique has been used in other infectious diseases

948
0:47:39.701,000 --> 0:47:42,000
and throughout history and even in Ebola recently.

949
0:47:42.891,000 --> 0:47:44,000
That's something that could potentially be done.

950
0:47:45.313,000 --> 0:47:5,000
Of course, today, it's more attractive if you can make antibodies in the laboratory

951
0:47:50.45,000 --> 0:47:51,000
and then have those available at scale

952
0:47:52.406,000 --> 0:47:53,000
and use those,

953
0:47:53.58,000 --> 0:47:57,000
and I know of a lot of companies that are working on producing those antibodies,

954
0:47:57.72,000 --> 0:48:01,000
which could be infused in an emergency situation, and do that.

955
0:48:02.163,000 --> 0:48:04,000
Obviously, drugs may play an important role here.

956
0:48:04.83,000 --> 0:48:06,000
There's a similar effort to try to create drugs

957
0:48:07.406,000 --> 0:48:09,000
that are active against this organism,

958
0:48:09.729,000 --> 0:48:12,000
and if we knew that you'd get sick but there was an effective treatment,

959
0:48:13.682,000 --> 0:48:16,000
that would also change a little bit of the dynamics

960
0:48:16.725,000 --> 0:48:18,000
of the fear that exists around this pandemic.

961
0:48:19.689,000 --> 0:48:21,000
So I think there are lots of interventions.

962
0:48:22.419,000 --> 0:48:23,000
Of course, traditionally,

963
0:48:23.719,000 --> 0:48:27,000
a preventive vaccine is the best way to deal with these types of epidemics.

964
0:48:29.713,000 --> 0:48:34,000
CA: So paint us -- it's the inner optimist in me, begging for something --

965
0:48:35.176,000 --> 0:48:37,000
paint us the best case scenario, Seth.

966
0:48:37.619,000 --> 0:48:38,000
Lots of people are saying,

967
0:48:39.501,000 --> 0:48:43,000
we don't want to be huddled in our homes by ourselves for 18 months,

968
0:48:44.445,000 --> 0:48:46,000
lovely though the internet is.

969
0:48:47.226,000 --> 0:48:52,000
What's the best case scenario, putting all the pieces together here?

970
0:48:53.261,000 --> 0:48:55,000
SB: Well, I think what is likely to happen,

971
0:48:56.198,000 --> 0:48:59,000
but I don't want to predict, because we're in unprecedented times here.

972
0:48:59.821,000 --> 0:49:03,000
What's likely to happen is that countries who don't take this seriously

973
0:49:04.711,000 --> 0:49:05,000
will have severe outbreaks,

974
0:49:06.481,000 --> 0:49:07,000
those that really take it seriously

975
0:49:08.336,000 --> 0:49:11,000
and put these extraordinary mechanisms in place

976
0:49:11.527,000 --> 0:49:12,000
will control the disease.

977
0:49:13.344,000 --> 0:49:14,000
It'll take some time, it'll take --

978
0:49:15.198,000 --> 0:49:19,000
you know, this is weeks, maybe months, not years, to do that.

979
0:49:19.637,000 --> 0:49:22,000
And then you end up with a situation where the disease is controlled,

980
0:49:23.259,000 --> 0:49:27,000
and you then can go back to life as normal with some cautions around it.

981
0:49:27.594,000 --> 0:49:3,000
Now there's beginning to be new tests that are going to be home tests.

982
0:49:31.223,000 --> 0:49:34,000
We're going to be able to figure out whether classrooms, regions,

983
0:49:34.767,000 --> 0:49:35,000
countries have disease.

984
0:49:36.347,000 --> 0:49:38,000
We can go back to some level of normalcy,

985
0:49:39.325,000 --> 0:49:42,000
but one thing that's really important is we can't have areas of the world

986
0:49:42.994,000 --> 0:49:43,000
with raging disease.

987
0:49:44.288,000 --> 0:49:45,000
So for example, if people said,

988
0:49:45.883,000 --> 0:49:48,000
"Oh, we're not worried about Africa, we're only worried about our countries,"

989
0:49:49.531,000 --> 0:49:52,000
you might end up in a situation where you have large numbers of infections,

990
0:49:53.114,000 --> 0:49:56,000
the virus is mutating, it's actually adapting to humans.

991
0:49:56.173,000 --> 0:49:57,000
We saw some of that with SARS.

992
0:49:58.085,000 --> 0:50:,000
And then it is easy to reintroduce.

993
0:50:01.014,000 --> 0:50:05,000
So what you want to do is dampen it down everywhere in the world.

994
0:50:05.148,000 --> 0:50:08,000
And maybe it'll burn out. Maybe that'll be it.

995
0:50:08.437,000 --> 0:50:1,000
I personally think we'll probably need a vaccine,

996
0:50:10.749,000 --> 0:50:15,000
but best case scenario is that those alone will stop the epidemic,

997
0:50:15.849,000 --> 0:50:18,000
and what we'll need is then a vaccine just in case it comes back,

998
0:50:19.027,000 --> 0:50:21,000
but of course if I was a betting man,

999
0:50:21.579,000 --> 0:50:23,000
I'd say let's get a vaccine as soon as possible,

1000
0:50:24.289,000 --> 0:50:27,000
because that's the best way to control a viral infection,

1001
0:50:27.811,000 --> 0:50:29,000
particularly one that is spread respiratorily.

1002
0:50:31.068,000 --> 0:50:33,000
CA: Yeah. It's so interesting what you said there.

1003
0:50:33.502,000 --> 0:50:35,000
Like, the vaccine doesn't know what continent it's on,

1004
0:50:36.328,000 --> 0:50:37,000
what country it's in.

1005
0:50:38.115,000 --> 0:50:4,000
It just does its thing.

1006
0:50:40.258,000 --> 0:50:42,000
SB: That's correct.

1007
0:50:42.878,000 --> 0:50:44,000
CA: So in terms of people listening here,

1008
0:50:45.359,000 --> 0:50:47,000
what kind of psychological advice can you give them?

1009
0:50:48.093,000 --> 0:50:49,000
What should expectations be?

1010
0:50:49.935,000 --> 0:50:52,000
Like, do we have to be ready to settle in for the long haul here,

1011
0:50:53.095,000 --> 0:50:57,000
or should we be looking forward to getting back to business

1012
0:50:57.352,000 --> 0:50:59,000
around about Easter time and celebrating?

1013
0:51:00.818,000 --> 0:51:03,000
SB: Well, again, I don't want to put a time line on it like others do.

1014
0:51:04.152,000 --> 0:51:07,000
What you're going to want to see is that bending of the curve.

1015
0:51:07.92,000 --> 0:51:09,000
I think Bill talked about this.

1016
0:51:10.385,000 --> 0:51:13,000
You want the reproductive rate below one.

1017
0:51:13.437,000 --> 0:51:15,000
You want to get it way below one if you can,

1018
0:51:15.963,000 --> 0:51:17,000
and then to begin to see the disease spread.

1019
0:51:18.451,000 --> 0:51:2,000
And what you don't want to do is, in the middle of that,

1020
0:51:21.145,000 --> 0:51:22,000
jump out and start having parties.

1021
0:51:22.804,000 --> 0:51:25,000
It's not time to go on spring break and start mixing again.

1022
0:51:25.961,000 --> 0:51:27,000
But with careful control,

1023
0:51:28.57,000 --> 0:51:31,000
you can begin to release the controls if that's what science shows us.

1024
0:51:32.44,000 --> 0:51:35,000
And I think the most important thing here is we need the data to tell us that.

1025
0:51:36.181,000 --> 0:51:37,000
That's why testing is so important.

1026
0:51:38.157,000 --> 0:51:4,000
With the wide availability of testing,

1027
0:51:40.5,000 --> 0:51:43,000
we'll be able to keep tabs, know what's happening.

1028
0:51:43.678,000 --> 0:51:45,000
We'll know how many people are asymptomatic, what's happened.

1029
0:51:46.62,000 --> 0:51:48,000
We'll know where there are hot communities,

1030
0:51:48.707,000 --> 0:51:5,000
and we'll be able to deal with this,

1031
0:51:50.844,000 --> 0:51:51,000
is my prediction.

1032
0:51:52.024,000 --> 0:51:55,000
So I don't think this is over a very, very long time,

1033
0:51:55.719,000 --> 0:51:58,000
but I wouldn't rush it during this unprecedented moment.

1034
0:51:59.594,000 --> 0:52:01,000
Otherwise, we're going to end up seeing what we saw in Italy.

1035
0:52:02.456,000 --> 0:52:03,000
What we're seeing in New York right now

1036
0:52:04.356,000 --> 0:52:05,000
is the overwhelming of the health system.

1037
0:52:07.09,000 --> 0:52:1,000
CA: Yeah, no kidding. New York is a scary place right now.

1038
0:52:10.656,000 --> 0:52:11,000
I was out walking today.

1039
0:52:12.239,000 --> 0:52:13,000
I hope that was OK.

1040
0:52:13.458,000 --> 0:52:15,000
But there was no one. There was no one.

1041
0:52:15.604,000 --> 0:52:19,000
Like, you couldn't get within six feet of someone if you tried right now,

1042
0:52:19.814,000 --> 0:52:22,000
on the busiest walk spots.

1043
0:52:23.581,000 --> 0:52:28,000
That was nice to see, but man, it's startling.

1044
0:52:29.657,000 --> 0:52:33,000
SB: I mean, recent data has shown that droplets can spread the disease,

1045
0:52:34.522,000 --> 0:52:36,000
and so people are rightfully being cautious.

1046
0:52:36.962,000 --> 0:52:37,000
And we didn't know that.

1047
0:52:38.149,000 --> 0:52:41,000
You remember when we started, we said it's a point outbreak,

1048
0:52:41.41,000 --> 0:52:42,000
out of Wuhan, wet market,

1049
0:52:43.266,000 --> 0:52:45,000
you had to be in the market to get the disease.

1050
0:52:45.51,000 --> 0:52:47,000
Then it was, if you were with sick people,

1051
0:52:47.553,000 --> 0:52:48,000
you got the disease.

1052
0:52:48.76,000 --> 0:52:49,000
Then it was maybe asymptomatics.

1053
0:52:50.319,000 --> 0:52:51,000
I think as we understand better,

1054
0:52:51.913,000 --> 0:52:53,000
that gives us the tools to do the right thing.

1055
0:52:55.121,000 --> 0:52:59,000
CA: There's a debate out there that seems to be growing again about masks.

1056
0:53:00.024,000 --> 0:53:04,000
The East and West take very different advice on masks.

1057
0:53:04.976,000 --> 0:53:08,000
We were hearing from Gary Liu yesterday that everyone in Hong Kong and China

1058
0:53:09.36,000 --> 0:53:1,000
is basically wearing masks,

1059
0:53:10.702,000 --> 0:53:11,000
and arguably, that has been effective.

1060
0:53:12.724,000 --> 0:53:14,000
The advice in the West against not wearing masks --

1061
0:53:15.655,000 --> 0:53:18,000
how much of that has been driven by just the fact that there's a shortage of masks

1062
0:53:19.598,000 --> 0:53:22,000
and that if anyone needs to wear them, it's medical professionals?

1063
0:53:23.083,000 --> 0:53:29,000
If it's water droplets, it seems like masks could be effective in prevention.

1064
0:53:30.101,000 --> 0:53:33,000
SB: I mean, the most important intervention, as you know,

1065
0:53:33.4,000 --> 0:53:37,000
is some isolation and very careful handwashing or use of sanitizers,

1066
0:53:38.337,000 --> 0:53:41,000
because what happens is, you touch your face --

1067
0:53:41.459,000 --> 0:53:45,000
I forget the number, I think it's like every one to two minutes --

1068
0:53:46.013,000 --> 0:53:47,000
and you touch your eyes,

1069
0:53:47.219,000 --> 0:53:5,000
so if you reach a door handle or you have contact with a surface,

1070
0:53:50.888,000 --> 0:53:52,000
and we know the virus can live on those surfaces,

1071
0:53:53.281,000 --> 0:53:54,000
and then you touch your face,

1072
0:53:54.704,000 --> 0:53:55,000
touch your mouth, touch your nose,

1073
0:53:56.661,000 --> 0:53:57,000
you can spread it.

1074
0:53:57.838,000 --> 0:53:59,000
So the purpose of a mask for a person who is not infected

1075
0:54:00.554,000 --> 0:54:02,000
is not so much to keep them from getting infected.

1076
0:54:02.942,000 --> 0:54:05,000
It is to keep them from touching their face.

1077
0:54:06.17,000 --> 0:54:08,000
So I think what's interesting here is,

1078
0:54:08.868,000 --> 0:54:11,000
how do we get people to have this personal sanitation?

1079
0:54:12.45,000 --> 0:54:15,000
If we have unlimited quantities of masks, people want to do it as a way

1080
0:54:15.853,000 --> 0:54:18,000
to remind themselves not to touch their face.

1081
0:54:19.388,000 --> 0:54:21,000
Now, that's very different if you're infected,

1082
0:54:21.598,000 --> 0:54:22,000
because if you're coughing,

1083
0:54:23.43,000 --> 0:54:28,000
having a mask on does reduce the spread of droplets,

1084
0:54:28.512,000 --> 0:54:33,000
and that's why they recommend it in a situation where somebody is infected

1085
0:54:34.514,000 --> 0:54:37,000
and has to go to the hospital or has to go out and be seen.

1086
0:54:38.551,000 --> 0:54:39,000
CA: Yeah, I was touching my face

1087
0:54:40.113,000 --> 0:54:42,000
all through the Bill Gates interview, apparently,

1088
0:54:42.456,000 --> 0:54:45,000
and I got called to task by our online friends,

1089
0:54:46.184,000 --> 0:54:47,000
which was very nice.

1090
0:54:47.365,000 --> 0:54:49,000
I don't know if I've been doing that today.

1091
0:54:49.434,000 --> 0:54:51,000
It's funny, you're unconscious of it. It's weird.

1092
0:54:51.814,000 --> 0:54:52,000
SB: Yes. No, it's automatic.

1093
0:54:53.182,000 --> 0:54:57,000
And in fact, there was a WHO challenge for safe handwashing,

1094
0:54:57.711,000 --> 0:55:,000
and I did a video, and I left my water running while I did it,

1095
0:55:00.766,000 --> 0:55:03,000
and my friends in the developing world came to me and said,

1096
0:55:04.053,000 --> 0:55:08,000
you know, I live in Switzerland by a lake where we have a lot of water,

1097
0:55:08.675,000 --> 0:55:1,000
and I wasn't careful, and they were absolutely right.

1098
0:55:11.591,000 --> 0:55:13,000
So it's really good we correct each other,

1099
0:55:13.652,000 --> 0:55:14,000
that's an important point,

1100
0:55:14.923,000 --> 0:55:16,000
and help each other in doing this

1101
0:55:17.09,000 --> 0:55:22,000
to get us to be as compliant as we possibly can for these issues.

1102
0:55:22.971,000 --> 0:55:23,000
Whitney.

1103
0:55:24.588,000 --> 0:55:26,000
WPR: Yep. So feedback online is overwhelmingly positive.

1104
0:55:27.514,000 --> 0:55:3,000
You're really answering all of everyone's questions out there,

1105
0:55:30.716,000 --> 0:55:32,000
and people really appreciate what you're sharing, Seth.

1106
0:55:33.414,000 --> 0:55:36,000
I think one big question is just for folks who are watching from home

1107
0:55:36.702,000 --> 0:55:38,000
and maybe who are not part of your community

1108
0:55:39.592,000 --> 0:55:41,000
in terms of the science community.

1109
0:55:41.907,000 --> 0:55:44,000
How can they contribute to this global response effort?

1110
0:55:45.034,000 --> 0:55:47,000
How can they do something to advance this?

1111
0:55:48.576,000 --> 0:55:49,000
SB: That's a great question.

1112
0:55:50.031,000 --> 0:55:55,000
So first of all, I think it's really important that citizens support leaders

1113
0:55:55.096,000 --> 0:55:56,000
who are following science,

1114
0:55:56.965,000 --> 0:55:57,000
are using science,

1115
0:55:58.935,000 --> 0:56:01,000
because, as you know, sometimes political leaders say,

1116
0:56:02.14,000 --> 0:56:05,000
"Well, I don't want to do this because it's not good for my image

1117
0:56:05.409,000 --> 0:56:08,000
or it's not good for the economy or it's not good for whatever."

1118
0:56:08.476,000 --> 0:56:11,000
And I think you want to have all of your decisions taken by science,

1119
0:56:11.718,000 --> 0:56:13,000
understanding that they're not the best science.

1120
0:56:13.996,000 --> 0:56:14,000
So, citizens need to applaud,

1121
0:56:15.566,000 --> 0:56:18,000
even if it's a tough decision that politicians take for the good

1122
0:56:18.832,000 --> 0:56:2,000
based upon science, that's a good thing.

1123
0:56:21.021,000 --> 0:56:23,000
The second thing that really would be helpful

1124
0:56:23.16,000 --> 0:56:28,000
is this concept: How do we keep our world focused on the fact

1125
0:56:28.921,000 --> 0:56:31,000
that these epidemics will occur?

1126
0:56:32.386,000 --> 0:56:34,000
Another example I didn't answer,

1127
0:56:34.502,000 --> 0:56:37,000
which Chris, when he asked me about what could be done,

1128
0:56:37.624,000 --> 0:56:39,000
we talked about this idea of platform technologies.

1129
0:56:40.07,000 --> 0:56:43,000
These are vaccines that you can test, get them all ready,

1130
0:56:43.49,000 --> 0:56:45,000
and then, when a new organism occurs, you can put it in there

1131
0:56:46.421,000 --> 0:56:48,000
and you know how to manufacture it, how to scale it up.

1132
0:56:49.105,000 --> 0:56:52,000
These types of things can be done. CEPI is trying to do that now.

1133
0:56:52.27,000 --> 0:56:53,000
But the challenge is,

1134
0:56:53.658,000 --> 0:56:55,000
if we, a year after this,

1135
0:56:55.856,000 --> 0:56:58,000
go down to having no money available for these types of issues,

1136
0:56:59.442,000 --> 0:57:,000
that will be a problem.

1137
0:57:00.629,000 --> 0:57:01,000
So what you need is citizens to say,

1138
0:57:02.493,000 --> 0:57:03,000
"I understand now

1139
0:57:04.047,000 --> 0:57:06,000
that health is precious,

1140
0:57:06.376,000 --> 0:57:08,000
and I want my government, my leaders

1141
0:57:09.282,000 --> 0:57:12,000
to invest in this, in the science,

1142
0:57:12.492,000 --> 0:57:13,000
in the ways of working

1143
0:57:13.674,000 --> 0:57:15,000
so that we will be as safe as we can be going forward."

1144
0:57:16.449,000 --> 0:57:19,000
And I think I can't emphasize enough how important a message that is

1145
0:57:20.171,000 --> 0:57:21,000
for citizens everywhere in the world.

1146
0:57:22.767,000 --> 0:57:23,000
CA: Mmm.

1147
0:57:24.914,000 --> 0:57:27,000
Hey Whitney, stay on as we wrap up here.

1148
0:57:29.185,000 --> 0:57:35,000
I guess what I'd like to give you a chance to do, Seth,

1149
0:57:35.324,000 --> 0:57:36,000
as we wrap this up

1150
0:57:36.697,000 --> 0:57:37,000
is just to look at the camera

1151
0:57:38.135,000 --> 0:57:42,000
and make your call to the world's leaders,

1152
0:57:42.488,000 --> 0:57:43,000
companies,

1153
0:57:44.242,000 --> 0:57:47,000
politicians, scientists, citizens.

1154
0:57:48.103,000 --> 0:57:5,000
How do we move forward?

1155
0:57:50.712,000 --> 0:57:51,000
How would you wrap this up?

1156
0:57:53.753,000 --> 0:57:54,000
SB: So from my perspective,

1157
0:57:55.546,000 --> 0:57:57,000
what we need is the world to come together at this moment,

1158
0:57:58.518,000 --> 0:58:01,000
not to talk about our national programs,

1159
0:58:01.567,000 --> 0:58:03,000
not to talk about our science are the best,

1160
0:58:03.902,000 --> 0:58:04,000
and they may be the best,

1161
0:58:05.381,000 --> 0:58:07,000
but how do we, as a world,

1162
0:58:07.465,000 --> 0:58:1,000
pool our best science, our best resources,

1163
0:58:10.665,000 --> 0:58:12,000
our best ways of working, our best manufacturing,

1164
0:58:13.523,000 --> 0:58:14,000
our best clinical trials,

1165
0:58:15.308,000 --> 0:58:17,000
to move this forward as fast as possible?

1166
0:58:17.742,000 --> 0:58:21,000
The WHO is a global organization whose job is this normative function,

1167
0:58:22.761,000 --> 0:58:26,000
and we can get scientists to help them make sure that the normative function

1168
0:58:27.522,000 --> 0:58:28,000
is as strong as it can be.

1169
0:58:29.388,000 --> 0:58:31,000
We can get the leaders of the world to come together

1170
0:58:32.135,000 --> 0:58:33,000
and put the resources in place.

1171
0:58:33.886,000 --> 0:58:35,000
Given the cost it's having on the economy,

1172
0:58:35.932,000 --> 0:58:37,000
this will be a real bargain to invest in it.

1173
0:58:38.473,000 --> 0:58:42,000
But what we need is to have that mindset of having science drive us

1174
0:58:43.123,000 --> 0:58:47,000
and to make sure that we have no barriers in stopping that science going forward.

1175
0:58:47.497,000 --> 0:58:5,000
That's my request to the world, and I think we can do it,

1176
0:58:51.003,000 --> 0:58:53,000
and if we do that, we will end up seeing the power of science,

1177
0:58:54.019,000 --> 0:58:56,000
which will give us the tools we need

1178
0:58:56.81,000 --> 0:58:59,000
to either stop it -- hopefully, it'll be stopped by then --

1179
0:59:00.324,000 --> 0:59:03,000
but stop it and then prepare us for the next one.

1180
0:59:04.748,000 --> 0:59:05,000
CA: Mmm.

1181
0:59:06.666,000 --> 0:59:07,000
Powerfully said.

1182
0:59:07.953,000 --> 0:59:09,000
I have to say, Seth, it's incredibly encouraging

1183
0:59:10.395,000 --> 0:59:13,000
to know that there are people like you out there in the trenches,

1184
0:59:13.82,000 --> 0:59:2,000
trying to coordinate this immense and crucial effort on behalf of all of us,

1185
0:59:20.844,000 --> 0:59:22,000
and also that there's an organization out there,

1186
0:59:23.795,000 --> 0:59:27,000
that your organization is tasked

1187
0:59:28.297,000 --> 0:59:31,000
to carry any effective vaccine

1188
0:59:31.562,000 --> 0:59:34,000
to the many billions of people who may live in countries

1189
0:59:35.574,000 --> 0:59:38,000
that can't afford to pay the same prices that the West can pay.

1190
0:59:39.504,000 --> 0:59:43,000
That's really cool that you're doing that,

1191
0:59:43.631,000 --> 0:59:46,000
and thank you so much for explaining so clearly to us

1192
0:59:47.135,000 --> 0:59:48,000
what the situation is.

1193
0:59:48.665,000 --> 0:59:51,000
I guess I speak for the majority of people listening

1194
0:59:52.156,000 --> 0:59:56,000
to say all power to you with pulling these threads together.

1195
0:59:56.68,000 --> 0:59:57,000
Thank you, Seth.

1196
0:59:58.22,000 --> 0:59:59,000
WPR: Thank you, Seth.

1197
0:59:59.397,000 --> 1:00:01,000
SB: Thank you, Chris and Whitney and the TED community

1198
1:00:02.05,000 --> 1:00:04,000
for all of your support over the years.

1199
1:00:04.709,000 --> 1:00:07,000
Let's continue to use science and technology

1200
1:00:08.232,000 --> 1:00:1,000
for the good of the world to solve problems like this.

1201
1:00:11.185,000 --> 1:00:12,000
CA: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

1202
1:00:13.385,000 --> 1:00:17,000
WPR: That was wonderful.

1203
1:00:17.439,000 --> 1:00:19,000
I learned so much from this conversation.

1204
1:00:20.006,000 --> 1:00:23,000
It seems like everyone online also really did, which was helpful.

1205
1:00:23.382,000 --> 1:00:26,000
And I'd like to remind everyone that, if you missed part of this interview,

1206
1:00:27.008,000 --> 1:00:29,000
you can watch it on our Facebook page as soon as we finish,

1207
1:00:29.798,000 --> 1:00:31,000
and then also -- and I'm going to read the link --

1208
1:00:32.206,000 --> 1:00:34,000
it's go.ted.com/tedconnects.

1209
1:00:34.924,000 --> 1:00:38,000
So our Facebook page, or go.ted.com/tedconnects.

1210
1:00:41.229,000 --> 1:00:43,000
CA: Thanks so much for joining us.

1211
1:00:43.473,000 --> 1:00:45,000
We get the sense people,

1212
1:00:46.261,000 --> 1:00:5,000
literally all over the world and in so many different circumstances,

1213
1:00:50.636,000 --> 1:00:54,000
and yet, this moment has given us a new excuse

1214
1:00:55.338,000 --> 1:00:57,000
to bring you all together.

1215
1:00:58.048,000 --> 1:00:59,000
Part of me,

1216
1:00:59.273,000 --> 1:01:05,000
even though you really could wish that we weren't in this situation,

1217
1:01:05.908,000 --> 1:01:09,000
it does give us a chance to explore some ideas in greater depth

1218
1:01:10.102,000 --> 1:01:13,000
than we're normally able to, to have these conversations.

1219
1:01:13.161,000 --> 1:01:16,000
These are not 15-minute talks on a red circle.

1220
1:01:16.808,000 --> 1:01:18,000
You can just go a little bit deeper,

1221
1:01:19.224,000 --> 1:01:21,000
and there's something really cool about that

1222
1:01:21.653,000 --> 1:01:23,000
that I think we want to do more of,

1223
1:01:24.173,000 --> 1:01:29,000
and we want to figure out how to hear from you and include you

1224
1:01:29.601,000 --> 1:01:33,000
and make sure that your questions and your thoughts are coming in.

1225
1:01:34.132,000 --> 1:01:38,000
As we speak, we're dreaming up what speakers to bring next.

1226
1:01:38.989,000 --> 1:01:39,000
We know about Friday.

1227
1:01:40.533,000 --> 1:01:41,000
We don't necessarily know beyond that.

1228
1:01:42.392,000 --> 1:01:43,000
But watch this space.

1229
1:01:43.604,000 --> 1:01:45,000
Whitney, talk about what's going to happen tomorrow.

1230
1:01:46.065,000 --> 1:01:47,000
WPR: So we're really excited.

1231
1:01:47.484,000 --> 1:01:5,000
We're going to have Priya Parker on to finish out the week for us.

1232
1:01:50.63,000 --> 1:01:52,000
She is the author of "The Art of Gathering,"

1233
1:01:52.741,000 --> 1:01:54,000
and she's going to give us some really helpful tips, I think,

1234
1:01:55.656,000 --> 1:01:57,000
about how we can stay connected during this time,

1235
1:01:57.993,000 --> 1:01:59,000
which is something I'm sure all of us are struggling with

1236
1:02:00.7,000 --> 1:02:02,000
as we're trying to practice social distancing

1237
1:02:02.881,000 --> 1:02:04,000
and are just spending more time physically apart.

1238
1:02:05.608,000 --> 1:02:08,000
So going into the weekend, that feels like the type of thing

1239
1:02:08.637,000 --> 1:02:1,000
I think all of us can really benefit from hearing.

1240
1:02:12.383,000 --> 1:02:15,000
CA: If you've got value from this conversation,

1241
1:02:16.163,000 --> 1:02:21,000
consider sharing it, sharing those links with people you know.

1242
1:02:21.536,000 --> 1:02:22,000
That would be cool.

1243
1:02:22.734,000 --> 1:02:25,000
And hang in there, everyone.

1244
1:02:25.854,000 --> 1:02:26,000
These are hard days.

1245
1:02:27.092,000 --> 1:02:3,000
We know many people are struggling hugely.

1246
1:02:30.545,000 --> 1:02:32,000
Hang in there. We'll get through it together somehow.

1247
1:02:33.141,000 --> 1:02:35,000
And until tomorrow, take care.

1248
1:02:35.907,000 --> 1:02:36,000
Bye for now.

1249
1:02:37.463,000 --> 1:02:38,000
WPR: Take care, everyone.

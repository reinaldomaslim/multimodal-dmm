1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Nanfu.

2
0:00:15.365,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In Chinese, "nan" means "man."

3
0:00:18.952,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And "fu" means "pillar."

4
0:00:21.579,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My family had hoped for a boy,

5
0:00:23.716,000 --> 0:00:26,000
who would grow up to be the pillar of the family.

6
0:00:27.692,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And when I turned out to be a girl,

7
0:00:29.955,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they named me Nanfu anyway.

8
0:00:31.835,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:33.284,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was born in 1985,

10
0:00:35.736,000 --> 0:00:38,000
six years before China announced its one-child policy.

11
0:00:40.958,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Right after I was born,

12
0:00:43.228,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the local officials came and ordered my mom to be sterilized.

13
0:00:48.767,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My grandpa stood up to the officials,

14
0:00:51.124,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because he wanted a grandson to carry on the family name.

15
0:00:55.982,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Eventually, my parents were allowed to have a second child,

16
0:01:00.177,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but they had to wait for five years

17
0:01:02.273,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and pay a substantial fine.

18
0:01:05.638,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Growing up, my brother and I

19
0:01:08.559,000 --> 0:01:11,000
were surrounded by children from one-child families.

20
0:01:13.004,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I remember feeling a sense of shame

21
0:01:16.066,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because I had a younger brother.

22
0:01:19.067,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I felt like our family did something wrong for having two children.

23
0:01:24.315,000 --> 0:01:25,000
At the time, I didn't question

24
0:01:25.824,000 --> 0:01:27,000
where this sense of shame and guilt came from.

25
0:01:31.062,000 --> 0:01:34,000
A year and a half ago, I had my own first child.

26
0:01:34.991,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It was the best thing that ever happened in my life.

27
0:01:38.538,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Becoming a mother

28
0:01:39.863,000 --> 0:01:43,000
gave me a totally new perspective on my own childhood,

29
0:01:43.966,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and it brought back my memories of early life in China.

30
0:01:49.49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
For the past three decades,

31
0:01:51.641,000 --> 0:01:55,000
everyone in my family had to apply for a permission from the government

32
0:01:56.387,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to have a child.

33
0:01:58.369,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I wondered

34
0:01:59.742,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what it was like for people who lived under the one-child policy.

35
0:02:04.361,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I decided to make a documentary about it.

36
0:02:08.964,000 --> 0:02:09,000
One of the people I interviewed

37
0:02:10.893,000 --> 0:02:15,000
was the midwife who delivered all of the babies born in my village,

38
0:02:16.075,000 --> 0:02:17,000
including myself.

39
0:02:18.456,000 --> 0:02:21,000
She was 84 years old when I interviewed her.

40
0:02:22.294,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I asked her,

41
0:02:24.042,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Do you remember how many babies you delivered throughout your career?"

42
0:02:28.399,000 --> 0:02:3,000
She didn't have a number for deliveries.

43
0:02:31.561,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She said she had performed

44
0:02:34.836,000 --> 0:02:38,000
60,000 forced abortions and sterilizations.

45
0:02:40.855,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Sometimes, she said,

46
0:02:43.189,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a late-term fetus would survive an abortion,

47
0:02:46.3,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and she would kill the baby after delivering it.

48
0:02:49.489,000 --> 0:02:52,000
She remembered how her hands would tremble

49
0:02:53.244,000 --> 0:02:54,000
as she did the work.

50
0:02:55.815,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Her story shocked me.

51
0:02:57.934,000 --> 0:02:59,000
When I set out to make the film,

52
0:03:00.165,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I expected it would be a simple story of perpetrators and victims.

53
0:03:04.606,000 --> 0:03:05,000
People who carried out the policy

54
0:03:06.558,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and people who are living with the consequences.

55
0:03:09.701,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But that wasn't what I saw.

56
0:03:12.082,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As I was finishing my interview with the midwife,

57
0:03:15.31,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I noticed an area in her house

58
0:03:17.565,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that was decorated with elaborate homemade flags.

59
0:03:21.857,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And each flag has a picture of a baby on it.

60
0:03:26.157,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These were flags that were sent by families

61
0:03:29.323,000 --> 0:03:32,000
whom she helped treat their infertility problems.

62
0:03:33.657,000 --> 0:03:35,000
She explained that she had had enough

63
0:03:36.014,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of performing abortions and sterilizations --

64
0:03:38.974,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that the only work she did now was to help families have babies.

65
0:03:44.839,000 --> 0:03:46,000
She said she was full of guilt

66
0:03:47.307,000 --> 0:03:49,000
for carrying out the one-child policy,

67
0:03:50.226,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and she hoped that by helping families have babies,

68
0:03:53.494,000 --> 0:03:55,000
she could counteract what she did in the past.

69
0:03:57.034,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It became clear to me she, too, was a victim of the policy.

70
0:04:02.973,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Every voice was telling her

71
0:04:05.688,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that what she did was right and necessary for China's survival.

72
0:04:10.108,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And she did what she thought was right for her country.

73
0:04:14.265,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I know how strong that message was.

74
0:04:17.273,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It was everywhere around myself when I grew up.

75
0:04:20.305,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It was printed on matches,

76
0:04:23.053,000 --> 0:04:24,000
playing cards,

77
0:04:24.713,000 --> 0:04:26,000
textbooks, posters.

78
0:04:27.18,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The propaganda praising the one-child policy

79
0:04:29.267,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was everywhere around us.

80
0:04:30.973,000 --> 0:04:32,000
[Anyone who refuses to sterilize will be arrested.]

81
0:04:33.545,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And so were the threats against disobeying it.

82
0:04:35.903,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The message seeped into our minds

83
0:04:38.363,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so much so that I grew up feeling embarrassed

84
0:04:41.592,000 --> 0:04:42,000
for having a younger brother.

85
0:04:45.625,000 --> 0:04:47,000
With each person I filmed,

86
0:04:49.53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I saw how their minds and hearts can be influenced by the propaganda,

87
0:04:55.914,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and how their willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good

88
0:05:00.033,000 --> 0:05:03,000
can be twisted into something very dark and tragic.

89
0:05:04.466,000 --> 0:05:07,000
China is not the only place where this happens.

90
0:05:08.442,000 --> 0:05:13,000
There is no country on earth where propaganda isn't present.

91
0:05:14.18,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And in societies that are supposed to be more open and free than China,

92
0:05:18.839,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it can be even harder to recognize what propaganda looks like.

93
0:05:23.728,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It hides in plain sight as news reports,

94
0:05:27.387,000 --> 0:05:31,000
TV commercials, political campaigning

95
0:05:31.448,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and in our social media feeds.

96
0:05:34.347,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It works to change our minds without our knowledge.

97
0:05:40.3,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Every society is vulnerable to accepting propaganda as truth,

98
0:05:45.427,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and no society where propaganda replaces the truth

99
0:05:48.259,000 --> 0:05:49,000
can be truly free.

100
0:05:50.349,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Thank you.

101
0:05:51.531,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Applause)

Greg Gage: Who wouldn't love acing a geography exam,

3
0:00:14.719,000 --> 0:00:16,000
remembering all the locations of the countries on a map

4
0:00:17.36,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or avoiding embarrassing situations of suddenly forgetting the person's name

5
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:22,000
standing right in front of you.

6
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It turns out that memory, like other muscles in the body,

7
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
can be strengthened and enhanced.

8
0:00:26.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But instead of practicing with flash cards,

9
0:00:29.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
there may be an interesting way

10
0:00:30.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that we can hack our memory while we sleep.

11
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Music)

12
0:00:38.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Why do we sleep?

13
0:00:39.44,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This has been a question asked since the early days of civilization.

14
0:00:42.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And while we may not know the exact answer,

15
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there are a number of really good theories about why we need it.

16
0:00:48.04,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Sleep is when the brain transfers short-term memories

17
0:00:50.56,000 --> 0:00:51,000
experienced throughout the day

18
0:00:52.08,000 --> 0:00:53,000
into long-term memories.

19
0:00:53.36,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This process is called memory consolidation,

20
0:00:55.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it's the memory consolidation theory that has scientists wondering

21
0:00:58.89,000 --> 0:01:,000
if we can enhance certain memories over others.

22
0:01:01.04,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There was a paper recently in the journal "Science"

23
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
by Ken Paller and his colleagues at Northwestern

24
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that seemed to show that this may be true,

25
0:01:07.76,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and that piqued our curiosity.

26
0:01:09.24,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Joud has been working on a DIY version of this task

27
0:01:11.68,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to see if we can improve memories through the use of sound in sleep.

28
0:01:14.92,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So Joud, how do you test if we can improve our memories with sleep?

29
0:01:18.32,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Joud Mar’i: We need a human subject.

30
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:21,000
[Step 1: Play a game]

31
0:01:22.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We have a memory game that we have on an iPad,

32
0:01:25.36,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then we make our subject play this game

33
0:01:27.4,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and remember the images and where they appear on the screen.

34
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
GG: So this is like a memory game you used to play as a child,

35
0:01:33.2,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which picture was where.

36
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And we tie each picture with a sound that represents it.

37
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
JM: So, if you can see a picture of a car, for example,

38
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and you would hear the car engine.

39
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Car engine starting)

40
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:45,000
GG: Just before you go to sleep we're going to test you.

41
0:01:46.48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We're going to see how well you remember where the pictures are.

42
0:01:49.56,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Every time you see the picture, you're going to hear the sound.

43
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And now comes the experiment.

44
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You're going to go take a nap.

45
0:01:55.66,000 --> 0:01:55,000
[Step 2: Take a nap]

46
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And while you're sleeping, we're going to be recording your EEG.

47
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
JM: And then we wait for them to go into what's called the slow-wave sleep,

48
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is the deepest phase of your sleep where it's really hard for you to wake up.

49
0:02:08.96,000 --> 0:02:09,000
GG: OK, pause.

50
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So, here's some information on sleep.

51
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There are four stages: we have lighter stages of sleep and REM,

52
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but what we're interested in is called slow-wave sleep.

53
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And it gets its name from the electrical signals

54
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
called Delta waves that we record from the brain.

55
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is the part of sleep where scientists believe

56
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that memory consolidation can happen.

57
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In this deep period of sleep,

58
0:02:27.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we're going to do something that you don't know we're going to do.

59
0:02:31.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
JM: Here's where the tricky part comes, and we start playing our cues.

60
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Car engine starting)

61
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:37,000
GG: Do you play all the cues?

62
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
JM: No. We only want to play half of them to see if there's a difference.

63
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
GG: So your hypothesis is

64
0:02:42.92,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the one that they were listening to while they're sleeping

65
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they're going to do better at.

66
0:02:47.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
JM: Yes, exactly.

67
0:02:49.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
GG: When you wake back up and play the game again,

68
0:02:52.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
do you do better or worse than before a nap?

69
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
What we found is that if we played you a cue during your sleep,

70
0:02:59.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
for example, a car --

71
0:03:01.32,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You would remember the position of that car

72
0:03:03.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
when you woke back up again.

73
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But if we didn't play you the cue during the sleep,

74
0:03:07.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for example, a guitar,

75
0:03:09.04,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you'd be less likely to remember that guitar when you woke up.

76
0:03:12.32,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The memories that were cued they remembered better

77
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
than the ones they weren't,

78
0:03:16.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
even though they don't remember hearing those sounds?

79
0:03:19.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
JM: Yes, we ask them.

80
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:22,000
GG: We know they're sleeping, they can't hear it, they wake up,

81
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they do better on those than the ones you didn't play.

82
0:03:25.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
GG: That's amazing. JM: It's like magic.

83
0:03:27.72,000 --> 0:03:3,000
GG: Joud ran this experiment on 12 people and the results were significant.

84
0:03:31.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's not that you remember things better; it's that you forget them less.

85
0:03:34.72,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I was a huge skeptic when I first heard that you could do better at a memory test

86
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:39,000
just by playing sounds during sleep.

87
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But we replicated these experiments.

88
0:03:42.12,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The facts and memories we collect throughout the day are very fragile,

89
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and they are easily lost and forgotten.

90
0:03:47.4,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But by reactivating them during sleep, even without us being aware,

91
0:03:50.6,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it seems like we could make them more stable and less prone to forgetting.

92
0:03:54.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's pretty incredible.

93
0:03:55.4,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Our brains are still active even when we're not.

94
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So if you're like me and a bit forgetful,

95
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:02,000
perhaps a solution is a pair of headphones and a soft couch.

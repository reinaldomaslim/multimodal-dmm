1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My work is play.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I play when I design.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I actually do that,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and the definition of play,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
number one, was engaging in a childlike

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
activity or endeavor,

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and number two was gambling.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I realize I do both

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
when I'm designing.

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I think that if you're not,

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there's probably something inherently wrong

14
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
with the structure or the situation you're in,

15
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
if you're a designer.

16
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But the serious part is what threw me,

17
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I couldn't quite get a handle

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
on it until I remembered an essay.

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.

20
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It was written by Russell Baker,

21
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.

22
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
this essay,

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or an excerpt from it

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because it really hit home for me.

26
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Here is a letter of friendly advice.

27
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Be serious, it says.

28
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Being solemn is easy.

30
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Being serious is hard.

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Children almost always begin by being serious,

32
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which is what makes them so entertaining

33
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when compared with adults as a class.

34
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.

35
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
like Adlai Stevenson,

37
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.

38
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That's because it is hard for most people

39
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to recognize seriousness, which is rare,

40
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,

41
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which is commonplace.

42
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Jogging, which is commonplace,

43
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.

44
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Poker is serious.

45
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Washington, D.C. is solemn.

46
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
New York is serious.

47
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything

48
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
about the future is solemn.

49
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Taking a long walk by yourself,

50
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,

51
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is serious.

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition

54
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of solemnity or seriousness to design,

55
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.

56
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Solemn design is often important and very effective design.

57
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Solemn design is also socially correct,

58
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and is accepted by appropriate audiences.

59
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's what right-thinking designers

60
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and all the clients are striving for.

61
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Serious design, serious play,

62
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is something else.

63
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
For one thing, it often happens

64
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
spontaneously, intuitively,

65
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
accidentally or incidentally.

66
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,

67
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.

68
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy

69
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
parts of human behavior that

70
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
don't really make any sense.

71
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Serious design is imperfect.

72
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being

73
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the first of its kind.

74
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful

75
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
from the solemn point of view.

76
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's because the art of serious play

77
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.

78
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Perfection happens during solemn play.

79
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, I always saw design careers

80
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like surreal staircases.

81
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If you look at the staircase, you'll see

82
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that in your 20s the risers are very high

83
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the steps are very short,

84
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and you make huge discoveries.

85
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.

86
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,

87
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and so that anything you do is a learning experience

88
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you're just jumping right up there.

89
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
As you get older, the risers get shallower

90
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the steps get wider,

91
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and you start moving along at a slower pace

92
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because you're making fewer discoveries.

93
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
And as you get older and more decrepit,

94
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you sort of inch along on this

95
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
sort of depressing, long staircase,

96
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
leading you into oblivion.

97
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.

99
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more

100
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.

101
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And in my 35 years of working experience,

102
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I think I was really serious four times.

103
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I'm going to show them to you now,

104
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because they came out of very specific conditions.

105
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's great to be a kid.

106
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, when I was in my early 20s,

107
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,

108
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I had no idea what a great job I had.

109
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I thought everybody had a job like that.

110
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And what --

111
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,

112
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
what was going on around me

113
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the things that came at the time I walked into design

114
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
were the enemy.

115
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I really, really, really hated

116
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the typeface Helvetica.

117
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
I thought the typeface Helvetica

118
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,

119
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
really repressive typeface,

120
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.

121
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And when I was in

122
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
my college days,

123
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this was the sort of design

124
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that was fashionable and popular.

125
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,

126
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,

127
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I made parodies about it.

128
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.

129
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So -- so, my goal in life

131
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.

132
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica

133
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.

134
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design

135
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the early 70s. There weren't --

136
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.

137
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.

138
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You had to go places and find the stuff.

139
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And what I responded to was, you know,

140
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Art Nouveau, or deco,

141
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or Victorian typography,

142
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or things that were just completely not Helvetica.

143
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I taught myself design this way,

144
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and this was sort of my early years,

145
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and I used these things

146
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in really goofy ways

147
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
on record covers and in my design.

148
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I wasn't educated. I just sort of

149
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
put these things together.

150
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,

151
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.

152
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I made these very lush,

153
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
very elaborate record covers,

154
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --

155
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because I didn't know what those things were.

156
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I just hated Helvetica.

157
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And that kind of passion

159
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
drove me into very serious play,

160
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
a kind of play I could never do now

161
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because I'm too well-educated.

162
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And there's something wonderful about

163
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that form of youth,

164
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
where you can let yourself

165
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
grow and play, and be

166
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
really a brat, and then accomplish things.

167
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
By the end of the '70s, actually,

168
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the stuff became known.

169
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world,

170
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they started winning awards,

171
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and people knew them.

172
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I was suddenly a post-modernist,

173
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and I began a career as -- in my own business.

174
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,

175
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.

176
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I didn't do what I think

177
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.

178
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,

179
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
turning out these sorts of designs

180
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that I was expected to do

181
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because that's who I was,

182
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn

183
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.

184
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So, here was the second condition

185
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for which I think I accomplished some serious play.

186
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There's a Paul Newman movie

187
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that I love called "The Verdict."

188
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.

189
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And in the movie, he plays

190
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
a down-and-out lawyer

191
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
who's become an ambulance chaser.

192
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And he's taken on --

193
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle

194
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that's sort of an easy deal,

195
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and in the midst of trying to connect the deal,

196
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
he starts to empathize

197
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and identify with his client,

198
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and he regains his morality and purpose,

199
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and he goes on to win the case.

200
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And in the depth of despair,

201
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,

202
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and he needs this case,

203
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
he needs to win this case so badly.

204
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There's a shot of Paul Newman alone,

205
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in his office, saying,

206
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"This is the case. There are no other cases.

207
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is the case. There are no other cases."

208
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And in that moment of

209
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
desire and focus,

210
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
he can win.

211
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And that is a wonderful

212
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
position to be in to create some serious play.

213
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I had that moment in 1994

214
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
when I met a theater director

215
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
named George Wolfe,

216
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who was going to have me design

217
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,

218
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
then known,

219
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then became the Public Theater.

220
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I began getting immersed

221
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in this project

222
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in a way I never was before.

223
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.

224
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.

225
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.

226
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.

227
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They had no logo and no identity,

228
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but they had these very iconic posters

229
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
painted by Paul Davis.

230
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And George Wolf had taken over from another director

231
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and he wanted to change the theater,

232
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and he wanted to make it urban and loud

233
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and a place that was inclusive.

234
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So, drawing on my love of typography,

235
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I immersed myself into this project.

236
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And what was different about it was the totality of it,

237
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place

238
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in a way I had never done before,

239
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where every aspect --

240
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was --

241
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
was designed by me.

242
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
There was no format.

243
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.

244
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I literally for three years made everything --

245
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
every scrap of paper, everything online,

246
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that this theater did.

247
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And it was the only job,

248
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
even though I was doing other jobs.

249
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't

250
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
with a client since.

251
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.

252
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And I think that you know

253
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
when you're going to be given this position,

254
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,

255
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's the moment of serious play.

256
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I did these things, and I still do them.

257
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I still work for the Public Theater.

258
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I'm on their board, and

259
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I still am involved with it.

260
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,

261
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
two years after I designed it,

262
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign

263
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that was all over New York.

264
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But something happened to it, and what happened to it was,

265
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
it became very popular.

266
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And that is a kiss of death for something serious

267
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because it makes it solemn.

268
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And what happened was

269
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that New York City, to a degree,

270
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
ate my identity

271
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because people began to copy it.

272
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Here's an ad in the New York Times

273
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."

274
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,

275
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,

276
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which meant I had to change it.

277
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So, I changed it so that every season was different,

278
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and I continued to do these posters,

279
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but they never had the seriousness

280
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of the first identity

281
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft

282
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
of everything being the same thing.

283
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,

284
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I must have done more than a dozen

285
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
cultural identities for major institutions,

286
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and I don't think I ever -- I ever

287
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
grasped that seriousness again --

288
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I do them for very big, important institutions

289
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in New York City.

290
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The institutions are solemn,

291
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and so is the design.

292
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,

293
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and they spend more money on them, but I think

294
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that that moment comes and goes.

295
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The best way to accomplish serious design --

296
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which I think we all have the opportunity to do --

297
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.

298
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
That doesn't happen very often,

299
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but it happened to me in the year 2000,

300
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
when for some reason or another,

301
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
a whole pile of different architects

302
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
started to ask me to design

303
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the insides of theaters with them,

304
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.

305
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'd never done this kind of work before.

306
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,

307
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I didn't know what they were talking about,

308
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --

309
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
a single job -- could go on for four years

310
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
because I was used to immediacy in graphic design,

311
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that kind of attention to detail

312
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.

313
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,

314
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but I fell in love with this process

315
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of actually integrating graphics into architecture

316
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because I didn't know what I was doing.

317
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"

318
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
New Yorkers look at their feet.

319
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And then I found that actors and actresses

320
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
actually take their cues from the floor,

321
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems

322
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
began to make sense.

323
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.

324
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They ran around corners,

325
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they went up sides of buildings,

326
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and they melded into the architecture.

327
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,

328
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel

329
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and backlit with fiber optics.

330
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And the architect, Jim Polshek,

331
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
essentially gave me a canvas

332
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to play typography out on.

333
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And it was serious play.

334
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

335
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
made out of completely inexpensive materials.

336
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.

337
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Things I never did before, built before.

338
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.

339
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.

340
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And then, inexpensive signage.

341
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Laughter)

342
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I think my favorite of these

343
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.

344
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It's a performing arts school.

345
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
This is the building that -- they had no money,

346
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and they had to recast it, and they said,

347
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?

348
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,

349
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Well, I think we can paint it.

350
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And we did. And it was play.

351
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And there's the building. Everything was painted --

352
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
typography over the whole damn thing,

353
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
including the air conditioning ducts.

354
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I hired guys who paint flats

355
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
fixed on the sides of garages

356
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.

357
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.

358
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They used to climb up on the building and call me

359
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and tell me that they had to correct my typography --

360
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,

361
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and they did wonderful things with it.

362
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.

363
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters

364
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
my work had begun to become accepted.

365
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
People wanted it in big, expensive places.

366
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And that began to make it solemn.

367
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Bloomberg was all about numbers,

368
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and we did big numbers through the space

369
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED

370
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.

371
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But it became the end

372
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
of the seriousness of the play,

373
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and it started to, once again, become solemn.

374
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
This is a current project

375
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

376
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
where I got to be goofy.

377
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I was invited to design

378
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,

379
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.

380
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?

381
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,

382
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?

383
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So I had to actually give a presentation

384
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
to a city council

385
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and neighborhood constituents,

386
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,

387
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
"You know, really what you have here

388
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
are all these underpasses

389
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.

390
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"

391
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So I began doing this crazy presentation

392
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of these installations --

393
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
potential installations -- on

394
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
these underpass bridges,

395
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and stood up in front of the city council --

396
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and was a little bit scared,

397
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I have to admit.

398
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,

399
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and so utterly ridiculous,

400
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and ignored the brief so desperately

401
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,

402
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.

403
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And this is the bridge they're actually

404
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
painting up and preparing as we speak.

405
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation

406
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in the North Side of Pittsburgh,

407
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and it will probably become a landmark in the area.

408
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
John Hockenberry told you a bit about

409
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
my travail with Citibank,

410
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.

411
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And I actually am amused by them and like them,

412
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation

413
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
they actually keep their graphics very nice.

414
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I drew the logo for Citibank

415
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
on a napkin in the first meeting.

416
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
That was the play part of the job.

417
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And then I spent a year

418
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
going to long, tedious,

419
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
boring meetings,

420
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
trying to sell this logo through

421
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to a huge corporation

422
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to the point of tears.

423
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.

424
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
We made idiotic presentations

425
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
showing how the Citi logo made sense,

426
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and how it was really derived from an umbrella,

427
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
and we made animations of these things,

428
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.

429
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing,

430
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and it played out on such a grand scale,

431
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and it's so internationally recognizable,

432
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.

433
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo

434
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
until Fallon put it on

435
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
its very good "Live Richly" campaign,

436
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and then everybody accepted it all over the world.

437
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
So during this time I needed

438
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
some kind of counterbalance

439
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
for this crazy, crazy existence

440
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
of going to these long, idiotic meetings.

441
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And I was up in my country house,

442
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and for some reason, I began painting

443
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
these very big, very involved,

444
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
laborious, complicated

445
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
maps of the entire world,

446
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,

447
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,

448
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and completely controlling the information,

449
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
and going totally and completely nuts with it.

450
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
They would take me about six months initially,

451
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but then I started getting faster at it.

452
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Here's the United States.

453
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Every single city of the United States is on here.

454
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And it hung for about eight months

455
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,

456
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and they would point to a part of the map

457
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."

458
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.

459
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
(Laughter)

460
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
But what I liked about it was,

461
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
I was controlling my own idiotic information,

462
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and I was creating my own palette of information,

463
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and I was totally and completely

464
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
at play.

465
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
One of my favorites was

466
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election

467
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
that has the election results rolling around in the water.

468
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
I keep that for evidence.

469
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
(Laughter)

470
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Somebody

471
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
was up at my house and saw the paintings

472
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and recommended them to a gallery,

473
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
and I had a first show

474
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings

475
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
that I'm showing you now.

476
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.

477
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And they sold quickly,

478
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and became rather popular.

479
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
We started making prints from them.

480
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
This is Manhattan, one from the series.

481
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.

482
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
We began doing these big silkscreen prints,

483
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and they started selling, too.

484
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
So, the gallery wanted me to have another show

485
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
in two years,

486
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
which meant that I really

487
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
had to paint these paintings

488
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
much faster

489
0:20:30.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
than I had ever done them. And I --

490
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
they started to become more political, and I picked areas

491
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
that sort of were in the news

492
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
or that I had some feeling about,

493
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
and I began doing these things.

494
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
And then this funny thing happened.

495
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
I found that I was no longer at play.

496
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
I was actually in this solemn landscape

497
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
of fulfilling an expectation

498
0:20:51.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
for a show,

499
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
which is not where I started with these things.

500
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
So, while they became successful,

501
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
I know how to make them,

502
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
so I'm not a neophyte,

503
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and they're no longer serious --

504
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
they have become solemn.

505
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
And that's a terrifying factor --

506
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:12,000
when you start something and it turns that way --

507
0:21:12.16,000 --> 0:21:15,000
because it means that all that's left for you

508
0:21:15.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
is to go back and to find out

509
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
what the next thing is that you can push,

510
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,

511
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
that you can be arrogant about,

512
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
that you can fail with,

513
0:21:27.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
and that you can be a fool with.

514
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
Because in the end, that's how you grow,

515
0:21:32.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
and that's all that matters.

516
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:36,000
So, I'm plugging along here --

517
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:39,000
(Laughter)

518
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.

519
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Thank you very much.

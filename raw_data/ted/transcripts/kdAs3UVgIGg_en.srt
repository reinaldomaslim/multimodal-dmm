1
0:00:12.75,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The second half of the last century was completely defined

2
0:00:17.283,000 --> 0:00:18,000
by a technological revolution:

3
0:00:19.306,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the software revolution.

4
0:00:21.313,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The ability to program electrons on a material called silicon

5
0:00:26.145,000 --> 0:00:29,000
made possible technologies, companies and industries

6
0:00:29.242,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that were at one point unimaginable to many of us,

7
0:00:33.243,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but which have now fundamentally changed the way the world works.

8
0:00:38.158,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The first half of this century, though,

9
0:00:40.103,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is going to be transformed by a new software revolution:

10
0:00:44.105,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the living software revolution.

11
0:00:46.921,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And this will be powered by the ability to program biochemistry

12
0:00:50.995,000 --> 0:00:52,000
on a material called biology.

13
0:00:53.314,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And doing so will enable us to harness the properties of biology

14
0:00:57.479,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to generate new kinds of therapies,

15
0:01:00.159,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to repair damaged tissue,

16
0:01:02.051,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to reprogram faulty cells

17
0:01:04.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or even build programmable operating systems out of biochemistry.

18
0:01:10.42,000 --> 0:01:13,000
If we can realize this -- and we do need to realize it --

19
0:01:14.017,000 --> 0:01:16,000
its impact will be so enormous

20
0:01:16.203,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that it will make the first software revolution pale in comparison.

21
0:01:20.104,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And that's because living software would transform the entirety of medicine,

22
0:01:24.362,000 --> 0:01:25,000
agriculture and energy,

23
0:01:25.945,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and these are sectors that dwarf those dominated by IT.

24
0:01:30.812,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Imagine programmable plants that fix nitrogen more effectively

25
0:01:35.01,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or resist emerging fungal pathogens,

26
0:01:37.939,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or even programming crops to be perennial rather than annual

27
0:01:41.5,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so you could double your crop yields each year.

28
0:01:43.792,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That would transform agriculture

29
0:01:45.914,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and how we'll keep our growing and global population fed.

30
0:01:50.794,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Or imagine programmable immunity,

31
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:57,000
designing and harnessing molecular devices that guide your immune system

32
0:01:57.342,000 --> 0:02:,000
to detect, eradicate or even prevent disease.

33
0:02:01.196,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This would transform medicine

34
0:02:02.791,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and how we'll keep our growing and aging population healthy.

35
0:02:07.501,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We already have many of the tools that will make living software a reality.

36
0:02:11.728,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We can precisely edit genes with CRISPR.

37
0:02:14.099,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We can rewrite the genetic code one base at a time.

38
0:02:17.206,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We can even build functioning synthetic circuits out of DNA.

39
0:02:22.428,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But figuring out how and when to wield these tools

40
0:02:24.921,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is still a process of trial and error.

41
0:02:27.367,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It needs deep expertise, years of specialization.

42
0:02:31.051,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And experimental protocols are difficult to discover

43
0:02:34.112,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and all too often, difficult to reproduce.

44
0:02:37.256,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And, you know, we have a tendency in biology to focus a lot on the parts,

45
0:02:41.753,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but we all know that something like flying wouldn't be understood

46
0:02:44.91,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by only studying feathers.

47
0:02:46.846,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So programming biology is not yet as simple as programming your computer.

48
0:02:51.391,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then to make matters worse,

49
0:02:53.093,000 --> 0:02:57,000
living systems largely bear no resemblance to the engineered systems

50
0:02:57.127,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that you and I program every day.

51
0:02:59.691,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In contrast to engineered systems, living systems self-generate,

52
0:03:03.826,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they self-organize,

53
0:03:05.321,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they operate at molecular scales.

54
0:03:07.032,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And these molecular-level interactions

55
0:03:09.192,000 --> 0:03:12,000
lead generally to robust macro-scale output.

56
0:03:12.234,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They can even self-repair.

57
0:03:16.256,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Consider, for example, the humble household plant,

58
0:03:19.274,000 --> 0:03:21,000
like that one sat on your mantelpiece at home

59
0:03:21.485,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that you keep forgetting to water.

60
0:03:23.749,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Every day, despite your neglect, that plant has to wake up

61
0:03:27.388,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and figure out how to allocate its resources.

62
0:03:30.159,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Will it grow, photosynthesize, produce seeds, or flower?

63
0:03:33.754,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And that's a decision that has to be made at the level of the whole organism.

64
0:03:37.717,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But a plant doesn't have a brain to figure all of that out.

65
0:03:41.222,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It has to make do with the cells on its leaves.

66
0:03:43.963,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They have to respond to the environment

67
0:03:45.89,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and make the decisions that affect the whole plant.

68
0:03:48.563,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So somehow there must be a program running inside these cells,

69
0:03:52.575,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a program that responds to input signals and cues

70
0:03:55.326,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and shapes what that cell will do.

71
0:03:57.679,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then those programs must operate in a distributed way

72
0:04:00.95,000 --> 0:04:01,000
across individual cells,

73
0:04:02.311,000 --> 0:04:06,000
so that they can coordinate and that plant can grow and flourish.

74
0:04:07.675,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If we could understand these biological programs,

75
0:04:11.015,000 --> 0:04:14,000
if we could understand biological computation,

76
0:04:14.161,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it would transform our ability to understand how and why

77
0:04:18.122,000 --> 0:04:19,000
cells do what they do.

78
0:04:20.152,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Because, if we understood these programs,

79
0:04:22.163,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we could debug them when things go wrong.

80
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Or we could learn from them how to design the kind of synthetic circuits

81
0:04:28.537,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that truly exploit the computational power of biochemistry.

82
0:04:34.407,000 --> 0:04:37,000
My passion about this idea led me to a career in research

83
0:04:37.449,000 --> 0:04:4,000
at the interface of maths, computer science and biology.

84
0:04:41.104,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And in my work, I focus on the concept of biology as computation.

85
0:04:46.334,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And that means asking what do cells compute,

86
0:04:49.5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and how can we uncover these biological programs?

87
0:04:53.76,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I started to ask these questions together with some brilliant collaborators

88
0:04:57.541,000 --> 0:04:59,000
at Microsoft Research and the University of Cambridge,

89
0:05:00.136,000 --> 0:05:02,000
where together we wanted to understand

90
0:05:02.443,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the biological program running inside a unique type of cell:

91
0:05:06.644,000 --> 0:05:07,000
an embryonic stem cell.

92
0:05:09.136,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These cells are unique because they're totally naïve.

93
0:05:12.32,000 --> 0:05:14,000
They can become anything they want:

94
0:05:14.512,000 --> 0:05:16,000
a brain cell, a heart cell, a bone cell, a lung cell,

95
0:05:17.101,000 --> 0:05:18,000
any adult cell type.

96
0:05:19.022,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This naïvety, it sets them apart,

97
0:05:20.723,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but it also ignited the imagination of the scientific community,

98
0:05:23.748,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who realized, if we could tap into that potential,

99
0:05:27.035,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we would have a powerful tool for medicine.

100
0:05:29.917,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If we could figure out how these cells make the decision

101
0:05:32.562,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to become one cell type or another,

102
0:05:34.717,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we might be able to harness them

103
0:05:36.431,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to generate cells that we need to repair diseased or damaged tissue.

104
0:05:41.794,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But realizing that vision is not without its challenges,

105
0:05:44.748,000 --> 0:05:46,000
not least because these particular cells,

106
0:05:47.536,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they emerge just six days after conception.

107
0:05:50.826,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then within a day or so, they're gone.

108
0:05:52.905,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They have set off down the different paths

109
0:05:54.986,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that form all the structures and organs of your adult body.

110
0:05:59.77,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But it turns out that cell fates are a lot more plastic

111
0:06:02.873,000 --> 0:06:03,000
than we might have imagined.

112
0:06:04.31,000 --> 0:06:08,000
About 13 years ago, some scientists showed something truly revolutionary.

113
0:06:09.393,000 --> 0:06:13,000
By inserting just a handful of genes into an adult cell,

114
0:06:13.763,000 --> 0:06:14,000
like one of your skin cells,

115
0:06:15.551,000 --> 0:06:18,000
you can transform that cell back to the naïve state.

116
0:06:19.534,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And it's a process that's actually known as "reprogramming,"

117
0:06:22.733,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it allows us to imagine a kind of stem cell utopia,

118
0:06:26.116,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the ability to take a sample of a patient's own cells,

119
0:06:29.781,000 --> 0:06:31,000
transform them back to the naïve state

120
0:06:32.165,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and use those cells to make whatever that patient might need,

121
0:06:35.319,000 --> 0:06:37,000
whether it's brain cells or heart cells.

122
0:06:38.541,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But over the last decade or so,

123
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
figuring out how to change cell fate,

124
0:06:43.398,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it's still a process of trial and error.

125
0:06:45.911,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Even in cases where we've uncovered successful experimental protocols,

126
0:06:50.443,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they're still inefficient,

127
0:06:51.934,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we lack a fundamental understanding of how and why they work.

128
0:06:56.65,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If you figured out how to change a stem cell into a heart cell,

129
0:06:59.679,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that hasn't got any way of telling you how to change a stem cell

130
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:03,000
into a brain cell.

131
0:07:04.633,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So we wanted to understand the biological program

132
0:07:07.588,000 --> 0:07:09,000
running inside an embryonic stem cell,

133
0:07:10.059,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and understanding the computation performed by a living system

134
0:07:13.589,000 --> 0:07:17,000
starts with asking a devastatingly simple question:

135
0:07:17.866,000 --> 0:07:2,000
What is it that system actually has to do?

136
0:07:21.838,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now, computer science actually has a set of strategies

137
0:07:24.712,000 --> 0:07:27,000
for dealing with what it is the software and hardware are meant to do.

138
0:07:28.563,000 --> 0:07:3,000
When you write a program, you code a piece of software,

139
0:07:31.247,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you want that software to run correctly.

140
0:07:33.271,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You want performance, functionality.

141
0:07:35.085,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You want to prevent bugs.

142
0:07:36.326,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They can cost you a lot.

143
0:07:38.168,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So when a developer writes a program,

144
0:07:40.034,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they could write down a set of specifications.

145
0:07:42.328,000 --> 0:07:43,000
These are what your program should do.

146
0:07:44.223,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Maybe it should compare the size of two numbers

147
0:07:46.515,000 --> 0:07:47,000
or order numbers by increasing size.

148
0:07:49.037,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Technology exists that allows us automatically to check

149
0:07:53.756,000 --> 0:07:55,000
whether our specifications are satisfied,

150
0:07:56.158,000 --> 0:07:58,000
whether that program does what it should do.

151
0:07:59.266,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And so our idea was that in the same way,

152
0:08:02.146,000 --> 0:08:05,000
experimental observations, things we measure in the lab,

153
0:08:05.238,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they correspond to specifications of what the biological program should do.

154
0:08:10.769,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So we just needed to figure out a way

155
0:08:12.669,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to encode this new type of specification.

156
0:08:16.594,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So let's say you've been busy in the lab and you've been measuring your genes

157
0:08:20.272,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you've found that if Gene A is active,

158
0:08:22.732,000 --> 0:08:25,000
then Gene B or Gene C seems to be active.

159
0:08:26.678,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We can write that observation down as a mathematical expression

160
0:08:30.284,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if we can use the language of logic:

161
0:08:33.125,000 --> 0:08:35,000
If A, then B or C.

162
0:08:36.242,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now, this is a very simple example, OK.

163
0:08:38.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's just to illustrate the point.

164
0:08:40.487,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We can encode truly rich expressions

165
0:08:43.435,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that actually capture the behavior of multiple genes or proteins over time

166
0:08:47.612,000 --> 0:08:49,000
across multiple different experiments.

167
0:08:50.521,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And so by translating our observations

168
0:08:53.171,000 --> 0:08:54,000
into mathematical expression in this way,

169
0:08:55.188,000 --> 0:09:,000
it becomes possible to test whether or not those observations can emerge

170
0:09:00.31,000 --> 0:09:03,000
from a program of genetic interactions.

171
0:09:04.063,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And we developed a tool to do just this.

172
0:09:06.643,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We were able to use this tool to encode observations

173
0:09:09.549,000 --> 0:09:1,000
as mathematical expressions,

174
0:09:10.98,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and then that tool would allow us to uncover the genetic program

175
0:09:14.614,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that could explain them all.

176
0:09:17.481,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we then apply this approach

177
0:09:19.785,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to uncover the genetic program running inside embryonic stem cells

178
0:09:23.892,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to see if we could understand how to induce that naïve state.

179
0:09:28.105,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And this tool was actually built

180
0:09:30.081,000 --> 0:09:32,000
on a solver that's deployed routinely around the world

181
0:09:32.757,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for conventional software verification.

182
0:09:35.63,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So we started with a set of nearly 50 different specifications

183
0:09:39.345,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that we generated from experimental observations of embryonic stem cells.

184
0:09:43.875,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And by encoding these observations in this tool,

185
0:09:46.535,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we were able to uncover the first molecular program

186
0:09:49.744,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that could explain all of them.

187
0:09:52.309,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now, that's kind of a feat in and of itself, right?

188
0:09:54.846,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Being able to reconcile all of these different observations

189
0:09:57.772,000 --> 0:10:,000
is not the kind of thing you can do on the back of an envelope,

190
0:10:00.863,000 --> 0:10:02,000
even if you have a really big envelope.

191
0:10:04.19,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Because we've got this kind of understanding,

192
0:10:06.372,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we could go one step further.

193
0:10:07.858,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We could use this program to predict what this cell might do

194
0:10:11.253,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in conditions we hadn't yet tested.

195
0:10:13.453,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We could probe the program in silico.

196
0:10:16.735,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And so we did just that:

197
0:10:18.006,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we generated predictions that we tested in the lab,

198
0:10:21.21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and we found that this program was highly predictive.

199
0:10:24.266,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It told us how we could accelerate progress

200
0:10:26.915,000 --> 0:10:29,000
back to the naïve state quickly and efficiently.

201
0:10:29.999,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It told us which genes to target to do that,

202
0:10:32.593,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which genes might even hinder that process.

203
0:10:35.241,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We even found the program predicted the order in which genes would switch on.

204
0:10:40.98,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So this approach really allowed us to uncover the dynamics

205
0:10:44.144,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of what the cells are doing.

206
0:10:47.728,000 --> 0:10:5,000
What we've developed, it's not a method that's specific to stem cell biology.

207
0:10:51.394,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Rather, it allows us to make sense of the computation

208
0:10:54.102,000 --> 0:10:55,000
being carried out by the cell

209
0:10:55.811,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in the context of genetic interactions.

210
0:10:58.666,000 --> 0:11:,000
So really, it's just one building block.

211
0:11:00.978,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The field urgently needs to develop new approaches

212
0:11:03.687,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to understand biological computation more broadly

213
0:11:06.406,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and at different levels,

214
0:11:07.797,000 --> 0:11:11,000
from DNA right through to the flow of information between cells.

215
0:11:11.95,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Only this kind of transformative understanding

216
0:11:14.771,000 --> 0:11:18,000
will enable us to harness biology in ways that are predictable and reliable.

217
0:11:21.029,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But to program biology, we will also need to develop

218
0:11:24.095,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the kinds of tools and languages

219
0:11:26.114,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that allow both experimentalists and computational scientists

220
0:11:29.546,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to design biological function

221
0:11:32.067,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and have those designs compile down to the machine code of the cell,

222
0:11:35.596,000 --> 0:11:36,000
its biochemistry,

223
0:11:36.801,000 --> 0:11:38,000
so that we could then build those structures.

224
0:11:39.309,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Now, that's something akin to a living software compiler,

225
0:11:43.006,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I'm proud to be part of a team at Microsoft

226
0:11:45.246,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that's working to develop one.

227
0:11:47.366,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Though to say it's a grand challenge is kind of an understatement,

228
0:11:50.616,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but if it's realized,

229
0:11:51.813,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it would be the final bridge between software and wetware.

230
0:11:57.006,000 --> 0:12:,000
More broadly, though, programming biology is only going to be possible

231
0:12:00.445,000 --> 0:12:04,000
if we can transform the field into being truly interdisciplinary.

232
0:12:04.748,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It needs us to bridge the physical and the life sciences,

233
0:12:07.724,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and scientists from each of these disciplines

234
0:12:10.015,000 --> 0:12:12,000
need to be able to work together with common languages

235
0:12:12.77,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and to have shared scientific questions.

236
0:12:16.757,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In the long term, it's worth remembering that many of the giant software companies

237
0:12:20.774,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the technology that you and I work with every day

238
0:12:23.29,000 --> 0:12:24,000
could hardly have been imagined

239
0:12:24.817,000 --> 0:12:27,000
at the time we first started programming on silicon microchips.

240
0:12:28.446,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And if we start now to think about the potential for technology

241
0:12:31.501,000 --> 0:12:33,000
enabled by computational biology,

242
0:12:33.951,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we'll see some of the steps that we need to take along the way

243
0:12:36.91,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to make that a reality.

244
0:12:39.231,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now, there is the sobering thought that this kind of technology

245
0:12:42.337,000 --> 0:12:43,000
could be open to misuse.

246
0:12:44.138,000 --> 0:12:46,000
If we're willing to talk about the potential

247
0:12:46.325,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for programming immune cells,

248
0:12:47.785,000 --> 0:12:5,000
we should also be thinking about the potential of bacteria

249
0:12:50.997,000 --> 0:12:51,000
engineered to evade them.

250
0:12:52.682,000 --> 0:12:54,000
There might be people willing to do that.

251
0:12:55.506,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now, one reassuring thought in this

252
0:12:57.252,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is that -- well, less so for the scientists --

253
0:12:59.565,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is that biology is a fragile thing to work with.

254
0:13:02.858,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So programming biology is not going to be something

255
0:13:05.294,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you'll be doing in your garden shed.

256
0:13:07.642,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But because we're at the outset of this,

257
0:13:09.746,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we can move forward with our eyes wide open.

258
0:13:12.353,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We can ask the difficult questions up front,

259
0:13:14.701,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we can put in place the necessary safeguards

260
0:13:17.765,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and, as part of that, we'll have to think about our ethics.

261
0:13:20.586,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We'll have to think about putting bounds on the implementation

262
0:13:23.782,000 --> 0:13:24,000
of biological function.

263
0:13:25.604,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So as part of this, research in bioethics will have to be a priority.

264
0:13:29.343,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It can't be relegated to second place

265
0:13:31.774,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in the excitement of scientific innovation.

266
0:13:35.154,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But the ultimate prize, the ultimate destination on this journey,

267
0:13:38.652,000 --> 0:13:41,000
would be breakthrough applications and breakthrough industries

268
0:13:42.12,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in areas from agriculture and medicine to energy and materials

269
0:13:45.588,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and even computing itself.

270
0:13:48.49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Imagine, one day we could be powering the planet sustainably

271
0:13:51.662,000 --> 0:13:52,000
on the ultimate green energy

272
0:13:53.545,000 --> 0:13:56,000
if we could mimic something that plants figured out millennia ago:

273
0:13:57.512,000 --> 0:14:,000
how to harness the sun's energy with an efficiency that is unparalleled

274
0:14:01.307,000 --> 0:14:02,000
by our current solar cells.

275
0:14:03.695,000 --> 0:14:05,000
If we understood that program of quantum interactions

276
0:14:06.32,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that allow plants to absorb sunlight so efficiently,

277
0:14:09.608,000 --> 0:14:12,000
we might be able to translate that into building synthetic DNA circuits

278
0:14:13.576,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that offer the material for better solar cells.

279
0:14:17.349,000 --> 0:14:2,000
There are teams and scientists working on the fundamentals of this right now,

280
0:14:21.066,000 --> 0:14:24,000
so perhaps if it got the right attention and the right investment,

281
0:14:24.333,000 --> 0:14:26,000
it could be realized in 10 or 15 years.

282
0:14:27.457,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So we are at the beginning of a technological revolution.

283
0:14:31.067,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Understanding this ancient type of biological computation

284
0:14:34.312,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is the critical first step.

285
0:14:36.468,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And if we can realize this,

286
0:14:37.809,000 --> 0:14:39,000
we would enter in the era of an operating system

287
0:14:40.675,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that runs living software.

288
0:14:42.604,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thank you very much.

289
0:14:43.794,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause)

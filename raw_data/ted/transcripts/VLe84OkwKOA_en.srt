1
0:00:12.949,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to have you look at this pencil.

2
0:00:15.55,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.

3
0:00:18.407,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And so are books you might have or the cars you own.

4
0:00:22.319,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They're all legal things.

5
0:00:24.258,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The great apes that you'll see behind me,

6
0:00:27.881,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they too are legal things.

7
0:00:31.549,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, I can do that to a legal thing.

8
0:00:35.822,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I can do whatever I want to my book or my car.

9
0:00:38.631,000 --> 0:00:4,000
These great apes, you'll see.

10
0:00:41.533,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison

11
0:00:45.42,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who wrote a book called "James & Other Apes."

12
0:00:48.464,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And he tells in his book how every single one them,

13
0:00:51.227,000 --> 0:00:53,000
almost every one of them, is an orphan

14
0:00:53.525,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who saw his mother and father die before his eyes.

15
0:00:58.11,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They're legal things.

16
0:00:59.748,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So for centuries, there's been a great legal wall

17
0:01:02.441,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that separates legal things from legal persons.

18
0:01:05.785,000 --> 0:01:08,000
On one hand, legal things are invisible to judges.

19
0:01:09.57,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They don't count in law.

20
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They don't have any legal rights.

21
0:01:13.215,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They don't have the capacity for legal rights.

22
0:01:15.699,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They are the slaves.

23
0:01:17.836,000 --> 0:01:19,000
On the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons.

24
0:01:20.66,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Legal persons are very visible to judges.

25
0:01:23.607,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They count in law.

26
0:01:25.312,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They may have many rights.

27
0:01:27.239,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They have the capacity for an infinite number of rights.

28
0:01:30.142,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And they're the masters.

29
0:01:33.3,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Right now, all nonhuman animals are legal things.

30
0:01:37.779,000 --> 0:01:39,000
All human beings are legal persons.

31
0:01:40.66,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But being human and being a legal person

32
0:01:43.469,000 --> 0:01:48,000
has never been, and is not today, synonymous with a legal person.

33
0:01:49.112,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Humans and legal persons are not synonymous.

34
0:01:52.478,000 --> 0:01:54,000
On the one side,

35
0:01:55.358,000 --> 0:01:59,000
there have been many human beings over the centuries

36
0:01:59.491,000 --> 0:02:,000
who have been legal things.

37
0:02:01.464,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Slaves were legal things.

38
0:02:02.997,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Women, children, were sometimes legal things.

39
0:02:07.499,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Indeed, a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries

40
0:02:11.146,000 --> 0:02:15,000
has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed

41
0:02:15.659,000 --> 0:02:2,000
these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons.

42
0:02:20.713,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But alas, that hole has closed up.

43
0:02:24.772,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, on the other side are legal persons,

44
0:02:26.819,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but they've never only been limited to human beings.

45
0:02:30.952,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There are, for example, there are many legal persons who are not even alive.

46
0:02:34.94,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In the United States,

47
0:02:36.547,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons.

48
0:02:40.54,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In pre-independence India,

49
0:02:42.515,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person,

50
0:02:45.139,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that a mosque was a legal person.

51
0:02:47.2,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court

52
0:02:49.63,000 --> 0:02:52,000
held that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person,

53
0:02:53.173,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and in 2012, just recently,

54
0:02:55.472,000 --> 0:02:58,000
there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand

55
0:02:59.233,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and the crown, in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person

56
0:03:02.484,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who owned its own riverbed.

57
0:03:05.525,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,

58
0:03:08.776,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when I had a full head of lush, brown hair,

59
0:03:12.5,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and indeed I was moved by it,

60
0:03:15.088,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless,

61
0:03:18.616,000 --> 0:03:19,000
defend the defenseless,

62
0:03:19.851,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions,

63
0:03:24.263,000 --> 0:03:27,000
billions of nonhuman animals are.

64
0:03:27.769,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I began to work as an animal protection lawyer.

65
0:03:30.788,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And by 1985, I realized that I was trying to accomplish something

66
0:03:35.664,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that was literally impossible,

67
0:03:37.591,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the reason being that all of my clients,

68
0:03:40.215,000 --> 0:03:43,000
all the animals whose interests I was trying to defend,

69
0:03:43.697,000 --> 0:03:45,000
were legal things; they were invisible.

70
0:03:46.182,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It was not going to work, so I decided

71
0:03:48.102,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that the only thing that was going to work was they had, at least some of them,

72
0:03:52.066,000 --> 0:03:55,000
had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall

73
0:03:55.864,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole

74
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:02,000
onto the other side of being legal persons.

75
0:04:02.986,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now, at that time, there was very little known about or spoken about

76
0:04:08.426,000 --> 0:04:1,000
truly animal rights,

77
0:04:10.794,000 --> 0:04:14,000
about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,

78
0:04:15.235,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and I knew it was going to take a long time.

79
0:04:18.005,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And so, in 1985, I figured that it would take about 30 years

80
0:04:21.405,000 --> 0:04:24,000
before we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation,

81
0:04:24.934,000 --> 0:04:29,000
long-term campaign, in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall.

82
0:04:30.716,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It turned out that I was pessimistic, that it only took 28.

83
0:04:38.801,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So what we had to do in order to begin was not only

84
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to write law review articles and teach classes, write books,

85
0:04:49.922,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts

86
0:04:52.89,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of how you litigate that kind of case.

87
0:04:54.875,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was,

88
0:04:58.908,000 --> 0:04:59,000
a legal cause of action.

89
0:05:00.367,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use

90
0:05:03.264,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to put their arguments in front of courts.

91
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It turns out there's a very interesting case

92
0:05:11.744,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that had occurred almost 250 years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,

93
0:05:16.348,000 --> 0:05:19,000
whereby a black slave had used the legal system

94
0:05:19.444,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and had moved from a legal thing to a legal person.

95
0:05:22.323,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it.

96
0:05:26.386,000 --> 0:05:31,000
James Somerset was an eight-year-old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa.

97
0:05:31.773,000 --> 0:05:33,000
He survived the Middle Passage,

98
0:05:34.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia.

99
0:05:39.894,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, 20 years later, Stewart brought James Somerset to London,

100
0:05:44.102,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and after he got there, James decided he was going to escape.

101
0:05:47.98,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized,

102
0:05:51.62,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because he wanted to get a set of godparents,

103
0:05:53.901,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because to an 18th-century slave,

104
0:05:55.712,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers

105
0:05:58.87,000 --> 0:06:,000
was to help you escape.

106
0:06:00.982,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And so in the fall of 1771,

107
0:06:04.998,000 --> 0:06:06,000
James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart.

108
0:06:07.641,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We don't know exactly what happened, but then James dropped out of sight.

109
0:06:12.313,000 --> 0:06:14,000
An enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers

110
0:06:15.309,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to canvass the city of London,

111
0:06:17.55,000 --> 0:06:19,000
find him, bring him not back to Charles Stewart,

112
0:06:20.15,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but to a ship, the Ann and Mary, that was floating in London Harbour,

113
0:06:26.173,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and he was chained to the deck,

114
0:06:27.793,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica

115
0:06:29.797,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where James was to be sold in the slave markets

116
0:06:32.816,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had

117
0:06:36.299,000 --> 0:06:38,000
harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.

118
0:06:39.15,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well now James' godparents swung into action.

119
0:06:42.359,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They approached the most powerful judge,

120
0:06:44.866,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench,

121
0:06:48.512,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus

122
0:06:52.157,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on behalf of James Somerset.

123
0:06:53.991,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, the common law is the kind of law that English-speaking judges can make

124
0:06:57.962,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions,

125
0:07:02.099,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ,

126
0:07:04.695,000 --> 0:07:06,000
capital G, capital W,

127
0:07:06.762,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will.

128
0:07:11.29,000 --> 0:07:12,000
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.

129
0:07:13.263,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The detainer is required to bring the detainee in

130
0:07:15.701,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty.

131
0:07:21.576,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat,

132
0:07:26.57,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because if James Somerset was a legal thing,

133
0:07:29.354,000 --> 0:07:32,000
he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus,

134
0:07:32.419,000 --> 0:07:34,000
only if he could be a legal person.

135
0:07:34.439,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume,

136
0:07:37.457,000 --> 0:07:41,000
without deciding, that James Somerset was indeed a legal person,

137
0:07:41.56,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and he issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in

138
0:07:44.971,000 --> 0:07:45,000
by the captain of the ship.

139
0:07:46.482,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There were a series of hearings over the next six months.

140
0:07:49.183,000 --> 0:07:54,000
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious,

141
0:07:55.011,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and he used the word "odious,"

142
0:07:56.845,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that the common law would not support it, and he ordered James free.

143
0:08:00.723,000 --> 0:08:03,000
At that moment, James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation.

144
0:08:04.883,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The free man who walked out of the courtroom

145
0:08:06.943,000 --> 0:08:08,000
looked exactly like the slave who had walked in,

146
0:08:09.191,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but as far as the law was concerned, they had nothing whatsoever in common.

147
0:08:14.79,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project,

148
0:08:17.74,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which I founded, then began to look at what kind of values and principles

149
0:08:21.25,000 --> 0:08:23,000
do we want to put before the judges?

150
0:08:24.128,000 --> 0:08:27,000
What values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk,

151
0:08:28.007,000 --> 0:08:31,000
were they taught in law school, do they use every day,

152
0:08:31.09,000 --> 0:08:34,000
do they believe with all their hearts -- and we chose liberty and equality.

153
0:08:34.779,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled

154
0:08:37.811,000 --> 0:08:39,000
because of how you're put together,

155
0:08:40.152,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest.

156
0:08:45.489,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the supreme interest in the common law

157
0:08:48.724,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are the rights to autonomy and self-determination.

158
0:08:54.015,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So they are so powerful that in a common law country,

159
0:08:57.795,000 --> 0:09:01,000
if you go to a hospital and you refuse life-saving medical treatment,

160
0:09:02.393,000 --> 0:09:04,000
a judge will not order it forced upon you,

161
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because they will respect your self-determination and your autonomy.

162
0:09:09.451,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now, an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled

163
0:09:12.714,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because you resemble someone else in a relevant way,

164
0:09:15.61,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and there's the rub, relevant way.

165
0:09:17.601,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So if you are that, then because they have the right, you're like them,

166
0:09:21.339,000 --> 0:09:23,000
you're entitled to the right.

167
0:09:23.684,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, courts and legislatures draw lines all the time.

168
0:09:26.846,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Some are included, some are excluded.

169
0:09:29.118,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But you have to, at the bare minimum you must --

170
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end.

171
0:09:39.695,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line

172
0:09:42.435,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in order to enslave an autonomous and self-determining being

173
0:09:45.742,000 --> 0:09:46,000
like you're seeing behind me,

174
0:09:47.53,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that that's a violation of equality.

175
0:09:51.27,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,

176
0:09:53.82,000 --> 0:09:55,000
it took us seven years, to find the jurisdiction

177
0:09:56.065,000 --> 0:09:58,000
where we wanted to begin filing our first suit.

178
0:09:58.271,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We chose the state of New York.

179
0:09:59.77,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be.

180
0:10:02.392,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We decided upon chimpanzees,

181
0:10:04.258,000 --> 0:10:06,000
not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors,

182
0:10:07.109,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but because they, Jane and others,

183
0:10:10.862,000 --> 0:10:12,000
have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades.

184
0:10:13.582,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have,

185
0:10:17.158,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they also resemble the kind that human beings have.

186
0:10:20.292,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And so we chose chimpanzees, and we began to then canvass the world

187
0:10:25.424,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition.

188
0:10:28.256,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England and the United States,

189
0:10:32.761,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and amongst them, they wrote 100 pages of affidavits

190
0:10:35.524,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in which they set out more than 40 ways

191
0:10:38.32,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in which their complex cognitive capability,

192
0:10:41.12,000 --> 0:10:43,000
either individually or together,

193
0:10:43.14,000 --> 0:10:46,000
all added up to autonomy and self-determination.

194
0:10:47.429,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, these included, for example, that they were conscious.

195
0:10:50.936,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But they're also conscious that they're conscious.

196
0:10:53.283,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They know they have a mind. They know that others have minds.

197
0:10:56.139,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They know they're individuals, and that they can live.

198
0:10:58.682,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow.

199
0:11:01.975,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday.

200
0:11:05.419,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They can anticipate tomorrow,

201
0:11:06.87,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee, especially alone.

202
0:11:11.587,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's the thing that we do to our worst criminals,

203
0:11:14.184,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it.

204
0:11:19.715,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They have some kind of moral capacity.

205
0:11:22.426,000 --> 0:11:24,000
When they play economic games with human beings,

206
0:11:25.352,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they'll spontaneously make fair offers, even when they're not required to do so.

207
0:11:29.392,000 --> 0:11:31,000
They are numerate. They understand numbers.

208
0:11:31.425,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They can do some simple math.

209
0:11:32.805,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They can engage in language -- or to stay out of the language wars,

210
0:11:36.869,000 --> 0:11:39,000
they're involved in intentional and referential communication

211
0:11:40.234,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those

212
0:11:42.721,000 --> 0:11:43,000
with whom they are speaking.

213
0:11:44.252,000 --> 0:11:45,000
They have culture.

214
0:11:45.9,000 --> 0:11:47,000
They have a material culture, a social culture.

215
0:11:48.501,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They have a symbolic culture.

216
0:11:50.916,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Scientists in the Taï Forests in the Ivory Coast

217
0:11:54.817,000 --> 0:11:57,000
found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open

218
0:11:58.346,000 --> 0:12:,000
the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.

219
0:12:01.132,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It takes a long time to learn how to do that,

220
0:12:03.431,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and they excavated the area and they found

221
0:12:05.544,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that this material culture, this way of doing it,

222
0:12:08.377,000 --> 0:12:11,000
these rocks, had passed down for at least 4,300 years

223
0:12:11.72,000 --> 0:12:15,000
through 225 chimpanzee generations.

224
0:12:16.712,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.

225
0:12:19.104,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Our chimpanzee,

226
0:12:22.284,000 --> 0:12:24,000
first we found two of them in the state of New York.

227
0:12:25.187,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed.

228
0:12:28.391,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Then we found Tommy.

229
0:12:30.272,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Tommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me.

230
0:12:33.384,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage.

231
0:12:35.891,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We found him in a small room that was filled with cages

232
0:12:39.351,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York.

233
0:12:44.537,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.

234
0:12:46.711,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts.

235
0:12:52.353,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we found Hercules and Leo.

236
0:12:54.25,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They're two young male chimpanzees

237
0:12:55.953,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who are being used for biomedical, anatomical research at Stony Brook.

238
0:12:59.366,000 --> 0:13:,000
We found them.

239
0:13:00.671,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And so on the last week of December 2013,

240
0:13:03.383,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York

241
0:13:07.323,000 --> 0:13:1,000
using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument

242
0:13:10.801,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that had been used with James Somerset,

243
0:13:13.529,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus.

244
0:13:18.616,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We wanted the chimpanzees out,

245
0:13:20.727,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps,

246
0:13:23.513,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida

247
0:13:27.461,000 --> 0:13:32,000
which involves an artificial lake with 12 or 13 islands --

248
0:13:32.548,000 --> 0:13:34,000
there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live

249
0:13:35.411,000 --> 0:13:36,000
on each of them.

250
0:13:36.571,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee,

251
0:13:39.521,000 --> 0:13:43,000
with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible.

252
0:13:43.923,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now, all these cases are still going on.

253
0:13:48.82,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield.

254
0:13:52.622,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We shall. We shall.

255
0:13:54.23,000 --> 0:13:57,000
This is a long-term strategic litigation campaign. We shall.

256
0:13:58.11,000 --> 0:14:,000
And to quote Winston Churchill,

257
0:14:00.225,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the way we view our cases is that they're not the end,

258
0:14:04.393,000 --> 0:14:06,000
they're not even the beginning of the end,

259
0:14:06.436,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but they are perhaps the end of the beginning.

260
0:14:10.58,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you.

261
0:14:12.497,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.404,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Across Europe and Central Asia,

2
0:00:19.13,000 --> 0:00:21,000
approximately one million children live in large

3
0:00:21.69,000 --> 0:00:25,000
residential institutions, usually known as orphanages.

4
0:00:25.788,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment

5
0:00:28.846,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that care for children.

6
0:00:30.517,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Others know more about the living conditions there,

7
0:00:33.748,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but still think they're a necessary evil.

8
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
After all, where else would we put all of those children

9
0:00:39.597,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who don't have any parents?

10
0:00:41.748,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But 60 years of research has demonstrated

11
0:00:45.215,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that separating children from their families

12
0:00:47.471,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and placing them in large institutions

13
0:00:49.823,000 --> 0:00:51,000
seriously harms their health and development,

14
0:00:52.663,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and this is particularly true for young babies.

15
0:00:56.145,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As we know, babies are born

16
0:00:58.289,000 --> 0:01:,000
without their full muscle development,

17
0:01:01.049,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and that includes the brain.

18
0:01:02.973,000 --> 0:01:04,000
During the first three years of life, the brain grows

19
0:01:05.633,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to its full size, with most of that growth taking place

20
0:01:08.403,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the first six months. The brain develops

21
0:01:11.023,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in response to experience and to stimulation.

22
0:01:14.249,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Every time a young baby learns something new --

23
0:01:18.063,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to focus its eyes,

24
0:01:19.59,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to mimic a movement or a facial expression,

25
0:01:22.583,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to pick something up, to form a word or to sit up --

26
0:01:26.573,000 --> 0:01:29,000
new synaptic connections are being built in the brain.

27
0:01:30.15,000 --> 0:01:34,000
New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.

28
0:01:34.249,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.

29
0:01:39.157,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They communicate their delight to their children,

30
0:01:41.741,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who respond with smiles,

31
0:01:43.462,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and a desire to achieve more and to learn more.

32
0:01:47.864,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent

33
0:01:51.606,000 --> 0:01:54,000
provides the building blocks for physical, social,

34
0:01:54.817,000 --> 0:01:57,000
language, cognitive and psychomotor development.

35
0:01:58.327,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It is the model for all future relationships with friends,

36
0:02:02.541,000 --> 0:02:05,000
with partners and with their own children.

37
0:02:05.782,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It happens so naturally in most families

38
0:02:08.198,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware

39
0:02:11.302,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of its importance to human development and, by extension,

40
0:02:14.732,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to the development of a healthy society.

41
0:02:17.631,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize

42
0:02:20.173,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the importance of families to children.

43
0:02:23.182,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness

44
0:02:27.118,000 --> 0:02:31,000
on a massive scale the impact on children

45
0:02:31.276,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of institutionalization and the absence of parenting.

46
0:02:35.679,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Those of us who remember the newspaper reports

47
0:02:38.116,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution

48
0:02:41.37,000 --> 0:02:45,000
will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.

49
0:02:45.791,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was asked to help the director of a large institution to

50
0:02:48.55,000 --> 0:02:51,000
help prevent the separation of children from their families.

51
0:02:52.513,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage,

52
0:02:56.698,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and so I'd been told the conditions were much better.

53
0:02:59.616,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Having worked with lots of young children, I expected

54
0:03:02.066,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the institution to be a riot of noise,

55
0:03:04.682,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but it was as silent as a convent.

56
0:03:06.545,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It was hard to believe there were any children there at all,

57
0:03:09.991,000 --> 0:03:11,000
yet the director showed me into room after room,

58
0:03:12.627,000 --> 0:03:15,000
each containing row upon row of cots,

59
0:03:15.642,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in each of which lay a child staring into space.

60
0:03:21.658,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.

61
0:03:25.308,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Yet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see

62
0:03:27.347,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that some of the children were distressed,

63
0:03:28.919,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but the only noise was a low, continuous moan.

64
0:03:32.764,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The head nurse told me proudly,

65
0:03:34.864,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"You see, our children are very well-behaved."

66
0:03:38.085,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Over the next few days, I began to realize

67
0:03:40.828,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that this quietness was not exceptional.

68
0:03:42.891,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours,

69
0:03:46.664,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but their demands were not met, and so eventually

70
0:03:48.653,000 --> 0:03:5,000
they learned not to bother. Within a few days,

71
0:03:51.331,000 --> 0:03:54,000
they were listless, lethargic, and staring into space

72
0:03:54.827,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like all the others.

73
0:03:56.653,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Over the years, many people and news reports

74
0:03:59.57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have blamed the personnel in the institutions

75
0:04:01.741,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member

76
0:04:04.595,000 --> 0:04:08,000
of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.

77
0:04:09.162,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.

78
0:04:13.224,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.

79
0:04:17.099,000 --> 0:04:19,000
At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member

80
0:04:19.611,000 --> 0:04:22,000
may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.

81
0:04:22.976,000 --> 0:04:25,000
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait

82
0:04:26.672,000 --> 0:04:28,000
several hours before it can be changed again.

83
0:04:29.631,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The child's daily contact with another human being

84
0:04:32.28,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing,

85
0:04:36.748,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling,

86
0:04:39.648,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the walls or the bars of their cots.

87
0:04:43.78,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution,

88
0:04:46.679,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries,

89
0:04:49.812,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from the Czech Republic to Sudan.

90
0:04:52.604,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Across all of these diverse lands and cultures,

91
0:04:55.588,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the institutions, and the child's journey through them,

92
0:04:58.885,000 --> 0:05:,000
is depressingly similar.

93
0:05:01.478,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors

94
0:05:04.588,000 --> 0:05:06,000
like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth,

95
0:05:07.529,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs

96
0:05:11.34,000 --> 0:05:13,000
are used to control the behavior of these children,

97
0:05:14.171,000 --> 0:05:16,000
whilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them

98
0:05:16.372,000 --> 0:05:18,000
from harming themselves or others.

99
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities

100
0:05:21.752,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.

101
0:05:25.187,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.

102
0:05:29.53,000 --> 0:05:31,000
For those without disabilities, at age three,

103
0:05:32.193,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven,

104
0:05:34.741,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender,

105
0:05:38.694,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings,

106
0:05:41.239,000 --> 0:05:44,000
often without even a chance to say goodbye.

107
0:05:45.127,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.

108
0:05:47.905,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The older children bully the little ones. They learn to

109
0:05:50.615,000 --> 0:05:53,000
survive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.

110
0:05:53.964,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When they leave the institution, they find it really difficult

111
0:05:57.524,000 --> 0:06:,000
to cope and to integrate into society.

112
0:06:00.819,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In Moldova, young women raised in institutions

113
0:06:04.068,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers,

114
0:06:08.076,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions,

115
0:06:12.232,000 --> 0:06:16,000
young adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record,

116
0:06:16.591,000 --> 0:06:18,000
14 percent were involved in prostitution,

117
0:06:19.447,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and 10 percent had taken their own lives.

118
0:06:24.011,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But why are there so many orphans in Europe

119
0:06:26.892,000 --> 0:06:29,000
when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?

120
0:06:30.763,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents,

121
0:06:35.347,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and societies tend to blame these parents

122
0:06:37.336,000 --> 0:06:39,000
for abandoning these children, but research shows that

123
0:06:40.099,000 --> 0:06:43,000
most parents want their children, and that the primary drivers

124
0:06:43.22,000 --> 0:06:45,000
behind institutionalization

125
0:06:45.539,000 --> 0:06:49,000
are poverty, disability and ethnicity.

126
0:06:49.736,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Many countries have not developed inclusive schools,

127
0:06:52.835,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and so even children with a very mild disability

128
0:06:55.539,000 --> 0:06:57,000
are sent away to a residential special school,

129
0:06:58.115,000 --> 0:06:59,000
at age six or seven.

130
0:06:59.923,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.

131
0:07:04.057,000 --> 0:07:06,000
If the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit,

132
0:07:06.781,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and gradually the relationship breaks down.

133
0:07:10.899,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Behind each of the million children in institutions,

134
0:07:14.202,000 --> 0:07:17,000
there is usually a story of parents who are desperate

135
0:07:17.956,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova,

136
0:07:23.066,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who only had enough money to feed her baby,

137
0:07:25.459,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and so had to send her older son to the institution;

138
0:07:28.643,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children

139
0:07:31.683,000 --> 0:07:33,000
at home until her husband died,

140
0:07:34.312,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but then she had to go out to work full time,

141
0:07:36.555,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and with no support, felt she had no option

142
0:07:38.702,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but to place a child with disabilities in an institution;

143
0:07:42.534,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents

144
0:07:45.688,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital;

145
0:07:49.274,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or the new parents, the young couple who have

146
0:07:52.006,000 --> 0:07:56,000
just found out that their firstborn child has a disability,

147
0:07:56.512,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and instead of being provided with positive messages

148
0:07:59.567,000 --> 0:08:01,000
about their child's potential, are told by the doctors,

149
0:08:02.414,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"Forget her, leave her in the institution,

150
0:08:05.47,000 --> 0:08:08,000
go home and make a healthy one."

151
0:08:08.99,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.

152
0:08:12.522,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Every child has the right to a family, deserves

153
0:08:15.649,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.

154
0:08:19.48,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving

155
0:08:22.162,000 --> 0:08:25,000
families early on, they recover their developmental delays,

156
0:08:25.683,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and go on to lead normal, happy lives.

157
0:08:28.726,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's also much cheaper to provide support to families

158
0:08:32.287,000 --> 0:08:34,000
than it is to provide institutions.

159
0:08:34.806,000 --> 0:08:37,000
One study suggests that a family support service

160
0:08:38.002,000 --> 0:08:4,000
costs 10 percent of an institutional placement,

161
0:08:40.91,000 --> 0:08:42,000
whilst good quality foster care

162
0:08:43.174,000 --> 0:08:45,000
costs usually about 30 percent.

163
0:08:46.166,000 --> 0:08:49,000
If we spend less on these children but on the right services,

164
0:08:49.214,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality

165
0:08:53.166,000 --> 0:08:57,000
residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.

166
0:08:57.815,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus

167
0:09:02.352,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and transfer the resources from large institutions

168
0:09:05.188,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that provide poor quality care to community-based services

169
0:09:09.148,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that protect children from harm and allow them to develop

170
0:09:11.873,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania

171
0:09:15.7,000 --> 0:09:18,000
nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living

172
0:09:19.476,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in institutions, and more entering every day.

173
0:09:23.037,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, there are less than 10,000, and

174
0:09:25.348,000 --> 0:09:28,000
family support services are provided across the country.

175
0:09:28.796,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects

176
0:09:32.582,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of the global financial crisis, the numbers of children

177
0:09:35.574,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent

178
0:09:38.358,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in the last five years, and the resources are being

179
0:09:41.574,000 --> 0:09:45,000
redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.

180
0:09:46.227,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Many countries have developed national action plans for change.

181
0:09:49.457,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The European Commission and other major donors

182
0:09:51.978,000 --> 0:09:54,000
are finding ways to divert money from institutions

183
0:09:55.458,000 --> 0:09:57,000
towards family support, empowering communities

184
0:09:58.454,000 --> 0:10:,000
to look after their own children.

185
0:10:01.183,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But there is still much to be done to end the systematic

186
0:10:03.986,000 --> 0:10:05,000
institutionalization of children.

187
0:10:06.354,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.

188
0:10:09.423,000 --> 0:10:12,000
People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children,

189
0:10:12.947,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and the better alternatives that exist.

190
0:10:15.907,000 --> 0:10:17,000
If we know people who are planning to support orphanages,

191
0:10:18.871,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we should convince them to support family services instead.

192
0:10:22.913,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Together, this is the one form of child abuse

193
0:10:26.175,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that we could eradicate in our lifetime.

194
0:10:29.039,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Thank you. (Applause)

195
0:10:31.631,000 --> 0:10:35,000

1
0:00:13.349,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Five years ago, I stood on the TED stage, and I spoke about my work.

2
0:00:17.373,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But one year later,

3
0:00:18.7,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had a terrible accident as I left a pub one dark night with friends,

4
0:00:22.417,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in Scotland.

5
0:00:23.87,000 --> 0:00:27,000
As we followed the path through a forest, I suddenly felt a massive thud,

6
0:00:28.592,000 --> 0:00:29,000
then a second thud,

7
0:00:29.996,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I fell to the ground.

8
0:00:31.687,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had no idea what had hit me.

9
0:00:34.211,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I later found out that when the gate was opened on a garden,

10
0:00:38.657,000 --> 0:00:42,000
a wild stag stampeded along the path and ran straight into me.

11
0:00:44.054,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Its antler penetrated my trachea and my esophagus

12
0:00:47.471,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and stopped at my spinal cord and fractured my neck.

13
0:00:51.502,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My best friend found me lying on the floor,

14
0:00:53.775,000 --> 0:00:55,000
gurgling for help through a hole in my neck.

15
0:00:56.641,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And we locked eyes, and although I couldn't speak,

16
0:00:59.347,000 --> 0:01:01,000
she could understand what I was thinking.

17
0:01:01.387,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And she told me, "Just breathe."

18
0:01:04.659,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And so, whilst focusing on my breath, I had a strong sense of calmness,

19
0:01:08.744,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I was certain that I was going to die.

20
0:01:11.137,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Somehow, I was content with this,

21
0:01:12.805,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because I've always tried to do my best in life whenever I can.

22
0:01:15.942,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So I just continued to enjoy each breath as one more moment --

23
0:01:19.165,000 --> 0:01:21,000
one breath in and one breath out.

24
0:01:21.813,000 --> 0:01:23,000
An ambulance came, I was still fully conscious,

25
0:01:24.186,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I analyzed everything on the journey, because I'm a scientist:

26
0:01:27.439,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the sound of the tires on the road, the frequency of the street lights

27
0:01:30.812,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and eventually, the city street lights.

28
0:01:32.775,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I thought, "Maybe I will survive."

29
0:01:35.054,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And then I passed out.

30
0:01:38.046,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was stabilized at a local hospital and then airlifted to Glasgow,

31
0:01:42.292,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where they reconstructed my throat and put me in a coma.

32
0:01:46.761,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And while I was in the coma, I had many alternate realities.

33
0:01:49.984,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was like a crazy mix of "Westworld" and "Black Mirror."

34
0:01:53.641,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But that's a whole other story.

35
0:01:56.165,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital

36
0:01:59.843,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma,

37
0:02:03.312,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.

38
0:02:07.855,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And a week later, I woke up from that coma.

39
0:02:12.163,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And that was the first gift.

40
0:02:14.093,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Then I had the gift to think, the gift to move,

41
0:02:17.268,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the gift to breathe

42
0:02:19.334,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and the gift to eat and to drink.

43
0:02:21.481,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That took three and a half months.

44
0:02:24.339,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But there was one thing that I never got back, though,

45
0:02:26.911,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and that was my privacy.

46
0:02:28.664,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The tabloid press made the story about gender.

47
0:02:31.498,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Look -- I'm transgender, it's not that big a deal.

48
0:02:34.641,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Like, my hair color or my shoe size is way more interesting.

49
0:02:39.393,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When I last spoke here --

50
0:02:40.871,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

51
0:02:42.046,000 --> 0:02:43,000
When I last spoke here --

52
0:02:43.269,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:44.458,000 --> 0:02:46,000
at TED, I didn't talk about it, because it's boring.

54
0:02:47.727,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And one Scottish newspaper ran with the headline:

55
0:02:50.83,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Sex Swap Scientist Gored by Stag."

56
0:02:53.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And five others did similar things.

57
0:02:55.664,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And for a minute, I was angry.

58
0:02:57.442,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But then I found my calm place.

59
0:02:59.673,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And what ran through my head was, "They've crossed the wrong woman,

60
0:03:02.863,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they're not going to know what's hit them."

61
0:03:05.156,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:06.922,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm a kindness ninja.

63
0:03:08.153,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I don't really know what a ninja does,

64
0:03:10.022,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but to me, they slip through the shadows, crawl through the sewers,

65
0:03:13.23,000 --> 0:03:14,000
skip across the rooftops,

66
0:03:14.684,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and before you know it, they're behind you.

67
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They don't turn up with an army or complain,

68
0:03:18.995,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and they're laser-focused on a plan.

69
0:03:20.781,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So when I lay in my hospital bed,

70
0:03:22.608,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I thought of my plan to help reduce the chances

71
0:03:25.657,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of them doing this to somebody else,

72
0:03:27.53,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by using the system as is, and paying the price of sacrificing my privacy.

73
0:03:32.616,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What they told one million people, I will tell 10 million people.

74
0:03:36.887,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Because when you're angry, people defend themselves.

75
0:03:39.385,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So I didn't attack them,

76
0:03:40.769,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and they were defenseless.

77
0:03:42.297,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I wrote kind and calm letters to these newspapers.

78
0:03:46.282,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And The Sun newspaper, the kind of "Fox News" of the UK,

79
0:03:49.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
thanked me for my "reasoned approach."

80
0:03:52.696,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I asked for no apology, no retraction, no money,

81
0:03:56.593,000 --> 0:03:58,000
just an acknowledgment that they broke their own rules,

82
0:03:59.196,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and what they did was just wrong.

83
0:04:03.022,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And on this journey, I started to learn who they are,

84
0:04:06.67,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and they began to learn who I am.

85
0:04:08.963,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And we actually became friends.

86
0:04:10.797,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I've even had a few glasses of wine with Philippa from The Sun since then.

87
0:04:15.273,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And after three months, they all agreed,

88
0:04:17.661,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and the statements were published on a Friday,

89
0:04:19.837,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and that was the end of that.

90
0:04:21.249,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or so they thought.

91
0:04:22.52,000 --> 0:04:25,000
On the Saturday, I went on the evening news,

92
0:04:25.621,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with the headline "Six National Newspapers Admit They Were Wrong."

93
0:04:29.882,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the anchor said to me,

94
0:04:31.41,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"But don't you think it's our job as journalists

95
0:04:33.805,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to sensationalize a story?"

96
0:04:35.619,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I said, "I was laying on a forest floor, gored by a stag.

97
0:04:40.413,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Is that not sensational enough?"

98
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:44.746,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I was now writing the headlines.

100
0:04:46.538,000 --> 0:04:47,000
My favorite one was,

101
0:04:48.188,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"The stag trampled on my throat, and the press trampled on my privacy."

102
0:04:52.442,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It was the most read piece of BBC News online that day.

103
0:04:55.736,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I was kind of having fun.

104
0:04:58.379,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And by the end of my week of media,

105
0:05:00.181,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I started to use my newfound voice and platform

106
0:05:03.085,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to spread a message of love and kindness.

107
0:05:05.608,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And when I had the minute of anger and hatred

108
0:05:08.696,000 --> 0:05:09,000
towards those press and journalists,

109
0:05:10.546,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I had to identify my inner bigotry towards them.

110
0:05:15.188,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I had to meet and speak with these people

111
0:05:17.672,000 --> 0:05:18,000
without judgment.

112
0:05:19.482,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I had to let myself understand them,

113
0:05:21.649,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and in return, they began to understand me.

114
0:05:24.919,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well, six months later, they asked me to join the committee

115
0:05:27.847,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that regulates the press.

116
0:05:30.679,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And a few times a year, I sip tea and dip biscuits

117
0:05:34.234,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with the likes of Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, who says to me,

118
0:05:37.677,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"So, Kate, how have your last few months been?"

119
0:05:40.863,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And I respect them.

120
0:05:42.49,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I'm now one of three members of the public

121
0:05:44.697,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who has a seat at the table --

122
0:05:46.3,000 --> 0:05:47,000
not because I'm different,

123
0:05:47.911,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but because my voice counts, just like anybody else.

124
0:05:51.521,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And the irony is,

125
0:05:53.045,000 --> 0:05:55,000
every now and again, I'm asked to visit those printing presses

126
0:05:56.029,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of this declining industry,

127
0:05:57.919,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because some people think

128
0:05:59.475,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that the technology I spoke about here, last time at TED, my interactive print,

129
0:06:04.702,000 --> 0:06:05,000
might actually help save them.

130
0:06:07.053,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So beware of your inner bigot,

131
0:06:09.771,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and make friends from your enemies.

132
0:06:12.246,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Thank you.

133
0:06:13.429,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

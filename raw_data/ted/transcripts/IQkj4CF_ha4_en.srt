0:00:12.761,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Four years ago, here at TED,

2
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I announced Planet's Mission 1:

3
0:00:17.36,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to launch a fleet of satellites

4
0:00:19.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that would image the entire Earth, every day,

5
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and to democratize access to it.

6
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The problem we were trying to solve was simple.

7
0:00:27.76,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Satellite imagery you find online is old, typically years old,

8
0:00:30.88,000 --> 0:00:33,000
yet human activity was happening on days and weeks and months,

9
0:00:34.84,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and you can't fix what you can't see.

10
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We wanted to give people the tools to see that change and take action.

11
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The beautiful Blue Marble image, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972

12
0:00:45.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
had helped humanity become aware that we're on a fragile planet.

13
0:00:49.6,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And we wanted to take it to the next level,

14
0:00:51.68,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to give people the tools to take action, to take care of it.

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Well, after many Apollo projects of our own,

16
0:00:59.24,000 --> 0:01:01,000
launching the largest fleet of satellites in human history,

17
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we have reached our target.

18
0:01:06.08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Today, Planet images the entire Earth, every single day.

19
0:01:09.76,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Mission accomplished.

20
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:13.56,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Thank you.

22
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's taken 21 rocket launches --

23
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
this animation makes it look really simple -- it was not.

24
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And we now have over 200 satellites in orbit,

25
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:31,000
downlinking their data to 31 ground stations we built around the planet.

26
0:01:32.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel images of the Earth down each day.

27
0:01:38.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And on any one location of the Earth's surface,

28
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we now have on average more than 500 images.

29
0:01:44.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
A deep stack of data, documenting immense change.

30
0:01:49.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And lots of people are using this imagery.

31
0:01:51.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Agricultural companies are using it to improve farmers' crop yields.

32
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Consumer-mapping companies are using it to improve the maps you find online.

33
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Governments are using it for border security

34
0:02:03.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or helping with disaster response after floods and fires and earthquakes.

35
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And lots of NGOs are using it.

36
0:02:09.88,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, for tracking and stopping deforestation.

37
0:02:13.32,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Or helping to find the refugees fleeing Myanmar.

38
0:02:16.88,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Or to track all the activities in the ongoing crisis in Syria,

39
0:02:21.28,000 --> 0:02:22,000
holding all sides accountable.

40
0:02:24.64,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And today, I'm pleased to announce Planet stories.

41
0:02:28.12,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Anyone can go online to planet.com

42
0:02:30.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
open an account and see all of our imagery online.

43
0:02:34.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's a bit like Google Earth, except it's up-to-date imagery,

44
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and you can see back through time.

45
0:02:41.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You can compare any two days

46
0:02:42.76,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and see the dramatic changes that happen around our planet.

47
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Or you can create a time lapse through the 500 images that we have

48
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and see that change dramatically over time.

49
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And you can share these over social media.

50
0:02:57.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's pretty cool.

51
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause)

52
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Thank you.

53
0:03:02.44,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We initially created this tool for news journalists,

54
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:06,000
who wanted to get unbiased information about world events.

55
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But now we've opened it up for anyone to use,

56
0:03:09.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
for nonprofit or personal uses.

57
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we hope it will give people the tools to find and see the changes on the planet

58
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and take action.

59
0:03:18.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
OK, so humanity now has this database of information about the planet,

60
0:03:23.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
changing over time.

61
0:03:24.44,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2?

62
0:03:26.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In short, it's space plus AI.

63
0:03:29.72,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What we're doing with artificial intelligence

64
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is finding the objects in all the satellite images.

65
0:03:35.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The same AI tools that are used to find cats in videos online

66
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
can also be used to find information on our pictures.

67
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So, imagine if you can say, this is a ship, this is a tree,

68
0:03:46.88,000 --> 0:03:5,000
this is a car, this is a road, this is a building, this is a truck.

69
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And if you could do that for all of the millions of images

70
0:03:54.04,000 --> 0:03:55,000
coming down per day,

71
0:03:55.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
then you basically create a database

72
0:03:57.08,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of all the sizable objects on the planet, every day.

73
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:,000
And that database is searchable.

74
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So that's exactly what we're doing.

75
0:04:04.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Here's a prototype, working on our API.

76
0:04:06.92,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is Beijing.

77
0:04:08.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, imagine if we wanted to count the planes in the airport.

78
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We select the airport,

79
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it finds the planes in today's image,

80
0:04:15.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and finds the planes in the whole stack of images before it,

81
0:04:18.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and then outputs this graph of all the planes in Beijing airport over time.

82
0:04:23.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Of course, you could do this for all the airports around the world.

83
0:04:27.36,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And let's look here in the port of Vancouver.

84
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, we would do the same, but this time we would look for vessels.

85
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, we zoom in on Vancouver, we select the area,

86
0:04:38.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and we search for ships.

87
0:04:40.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it outputs where all the ships are.

88
0:04:42.002,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, imagine how useful this would be to people in coast guards

89
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who are trying to track and stop illegal fishing.

90
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
See, legal fishing vessels

91
0:04:50.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
transmit their locations using AIS beacons.

92
0:04:53.04,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But we frequently find ships that are not doing that.

93
0:04:56.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The pictures don't lie.

94
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so, coast guards could use that

95
0:05:00.2,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and go and find those illegal fishing vessels.

96
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And soon we'll add not just ships and planes

97
0:05:04.6,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but all the other objects,

98
0:05:05.92,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and we can output data feeds

99
0:05:07.84,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of those locations of all these objects over time

100
0:05:10.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that can be integrated digitally from people's work flows.

101
0:05:13.48,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In time, we could get more sophisticated browsers

102
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that people pull in from different sources.

103
0:05:18.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But ultimately, I can imagine us abstracting out the imagery entirely

104
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and just having a queryable interface to the Earth.

105
0:05:26.08,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Imagine if we could just ask,

106
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Hey, how many houses are there in Pakistan?

107
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Give me a plot of that versus time."

108
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"How many trees are there in the Amazon

109
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and can you tell me the locations of the trees that have been felled

110
0:05:37.48,000 --> 0:05:38,000
between this week and last week?"

111
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Wouldn't that be great?

112
0:05:40.4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Well, that's what we're trying to go towards,

113
0:05:42.56,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and we call it "Queryable Earth."

114
0:05:44.44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, Planet's Mission 1 was to image the whole planet every day

115
0:05:48.36,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and make it accessible.

116
0:05:50.72,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Planet's Mission 2 is to index all the objects on the planet over time

117
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and make it queryable.

118
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Let me leave you with an analogy.

119
0:05:58.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Google indexed what's on the internet and made it searchable.

120
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth and making it searchable.

121
0:06:06.36,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Thank you very much.

122
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.531,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was less than a year after September 11,

2
0:00:15.107,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I was at the Chicago Tribune

3
0:00:16.782,000 --> 0:00:17,000
writing about shootings and murders,

4
0:00:18.656,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and it was leaving me feeling

5
0:00:20.118,000 --> 0:00:21,000
pretty dark and depressed.

6
0:00:21.9,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I had done some activism in college,

7
0:00:23.482,000 --> 0:00:24,000
so I decided to help a local group

8
0:00:25.129,000 --> 0:00:27,000
hang door knockers against animal testing.

9
0:00:27.838,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I thought it would be a safe way

10
0:00:29.345,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to do something positive,

11
0:00:31.227,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,

12
0:00:33.793,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and we were all arrested.

13
0:00:36.118,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Police took this blurry photo of me

14
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
holding leaflets as evidence.

15
0:00:41.556,000 --> 0:00:42,000
My charges were dismissed,

16
0:00:43.42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but a few weeks later,

17
0:00:44.556,000 --> 0:00:46,000
two FBI agents knocked on my door,

18
0:00:46.593,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and they told me that unless I helped them

19
0:00:48.354,000 --> 0:00:5,000
by spying on protest groups,

20
0:00:50.455,000 --> 0:00:53,000
they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.

21
0:00:54.272,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,

22
0:00:56.308,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but I was terrified,

23
0:00:58.299,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and when my fear subsided,

24
0:01:00.183,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I became obsessed with finding out

25
0:01:02.1,000 --> 0:01:03,000
how this happened,

26
0:01:03.217,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how animal rights and environmental activists

27
0:01:05.395,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who have never injured anyone

28
0:01:07.609,000 --> 0:01:08,000
could become the FBI's number one

29
0:01:09.522,000 --> 0:01:12,000
domestic terrorism threat.

30
0:01:12.726,000 --> 0:01:13,000
A few years later, I was invited to testify

31
0:01:14.696,000 --> 0:01:16,000
before Congress about my reporting,

32
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I told lawmakers that, while everybody

33
0:01:18.558,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is talking about going green,

34
0:01:20.283,000 --> 0:01:21,000
some people are risking their lives

35
0:01:21.821,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.

36
0:01:25.333,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They're physically putting their bodies on the line

37
0:01:27.382,000 --> 0:01:3,000
between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.

38
0:01:30.807,000 --> 0:01:31,000
These are everyday people,

39
0:01:32.496,000 --> 0:01:34,000
like these protesters in Italy

40
0:01:34.582,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who spontaneously climbed over

41
0:01:36.644,000 --> 0:01:38,000
barbed wire fences to rescue beagles

42
0:01:38.945,000 --> 0:01:4,000
from animal testing.

43
0:01:41.106,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And these movements have been incredibly effective

44
0:01:43.782,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and popular,

45
0:01:45.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,

46
0:01:49.581,000 --> 0:01:5,000
eco-terrorist,

47
0:01:51.145,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to shift how we view them.

48
0:01:53.269,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They just made it up.

49
0:01:55.156,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now these companies have backed new laws

50
0:01:57.693,000 --> 0:01:59,000
like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,

51
0:02:00.432,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which turns activism into terrorism

52
0:02:02.551,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if it causes a loss of profits.

53
0:02:05.319,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now most people never even heard about this law,

54
0:02:08.318,000 --> 0:02:1,000
including members of Congress.

55
0:02:10.444,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Less than one percent were in the room

56
0:02:12.355,000 --> 0:02:14,000
when it passed the House.

57
0:02:14.815,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The rest were outside at a new memorial.

58
0:02:17.718,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They were praising Dr. King

59
0:02:19.379,000 --> 0:02:22,000
as his style of activism was branded as terrorism

60
0:02:22.805,000 --> 0:02:25,000
if done in the name of animals or the environment.

61
0:02:26.456,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Supporters say laws like this are needed

62
0:02:28.393,000 --> 0:02:29,000
for the extremists:

63
0:02:30.242,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.

64
0:02:33.191,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But right now, companies like TransCanada

65
0:02:35.453,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are briefing police in presentations like this one

66
0:02:38.778,000 --> 0:02:4,000
about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters

67
0:02:41.467,000 --> 0:02:43,000
as terrorists.

68
0:02:43.605,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism

69
0:02:47.228,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are not about violence,

70
0:02:48.779,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they're about public relations.

71
0:02:51.492,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Today, in multiple countries,

72
0:02:53.465,000 --> 0:02:54,000
corporations are pushing new laws

73
0:02:54.953,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that make it illegal to photograph

74
0:02:56.667,000 --> 0:02:59,000
animal cruelty on their farms.

75
0:02:59.927,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,

76
0:03:02.454,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and today we released a lawsuit

77
0:03:04.227,000 --> 0:03:05,000
challenging it as unconstitutional

78
0:03:05.954,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as a threat to journalism.

79
0:03:08.527,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,

80
0:03:10.865,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as they're called,

81
0:03:12.3,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was a young woman named Amy Meyer,

82
0:03:13.952,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and Amy saw a sick cow being moved

83
0:03:15.565,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse

84
0:03:18.114,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as she was on the public street.

85
0:03:20.528,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And Amy did what any of us would:

86
0:03:22.739,000 --> 0:03:23,000
She filmed it.

87
0:03:24.514,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,

88
0:03:27.563,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar

89
0:03:30.488,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.

90
0:03:33.738,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that

91
0:03:35.756,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is a threat.

92
0:03:37.576,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Through the Freedom of Information Act,

93
0:03:39.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I learned that the counter-terrorism unit

94
0:03:41.1,000 --> 0:03:43,000
has been monitoring my articles

95
0:03:43.177,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and speeches like this one.

96
0:03:45.463,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They even included this nice little write-up of my book.

97
0:03:47.689,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They described it as "compelling and well-written."

98
0:03:50.804,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Applause)

99
0:03:55.525,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Blurb on the next book, right?

100
0:03:58.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The point of all of this is to make us afraid,

101
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith

102
0:04:04.289,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in the power of education.

103
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Our best weapon is sunlight.

104
0:04:09.687,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man

105
0:04:11.574,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.

106
0:04:14.899,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Over and over throughout history,

107
0:04:16.461,000 --> 0:04:17,000
people in power have used fear

108
0:04:18.449,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to silence the truth and to silence dissent.

109
0:04:22.248,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's time we strike a new note.

110
0:04:24.287,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Thank you.

111
0:04:26.262,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

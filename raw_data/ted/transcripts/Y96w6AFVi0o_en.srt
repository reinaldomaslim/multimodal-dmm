1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, about three years ago I was in London,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I represent a group of people,

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We want to be in the forefront fields,

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and we want to do it differently.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We want to get out of this thing

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and decide what science gets done.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had.

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here.

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is take you on a quick tour of some of the things

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that we talk about and we think about.

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So, we think a lot about what really makes science work?

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The first thing that anybody who knows science,

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and has been around science,

23
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method

24
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is wrong. There is no method.

25
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together

26
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as a community, from incomplete evidence

27
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to conclusions that we all agree about.

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.

29
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So how does it work?

30
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Well, my belief is that it works

31
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.

32
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And here are some of the ethical principles.

33
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.

34
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
I’m in entertain, amaze mode.

35
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But one of the principles is that everybody

37
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who is part of the community gets to fight and argue

38
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
as hard as they can for what they believe.

39
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding

40
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that the only people who are going to decide, you know,

41
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
whether I’m right or somebody else is right,

42
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
are the people in our community in the next generation,

43
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in 30 and 50 years.

44
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So it’s this combination of respect

45
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for the tradition and community we’re in,

46
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,

47
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that makes science work.

48
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And being in this process of being in a community

49
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,

50
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I believe, teaches us about democracy.

51
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science

52
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,

53
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but there has been, historically, a relationship

54
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,

55
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and how people think about the society that they live in.

56
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.

57
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science

58
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.

59
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,

60
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,

61
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.

62
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
goes to its natural place, which was of course,

64
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,

65
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,

66
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
embraced Aristotle and blessed it.

67
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the idea is that everything is defined.

68
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,

69
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,

70
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
perfect realm, where lives God,

71
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who is the ultimate judge of everything.

72
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology,

73
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and in a certain sense, medieval society.

74
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about

75
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
space and time and motion and so forth of Newton.

76
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought

77
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of John Locke and his collaborators.

78
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And they were very closely associated.

79
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.

80
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,

81
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and a society on the other hand, were closely related.

82
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And let me show you.

83
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you.

84
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There are particles and they move around

85
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.

86
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,

87
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,

88
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but with respect to this absolute notion of space,

89
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which for Newton was God.

90
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals

91
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,

92
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and those are defined with respect to some absolute,

93
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,

94
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
which are independent of what else has happened in the society.

95
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.

96
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
There is also an omniscient observer

97
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
who knows everything, who is God,

98
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who is in a certain sense outside the universe,

99
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because he has no role in anything that happens,

100
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but is in a certain sense everywhere,

101
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because space is just the way that God knows

102
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
where everything is, according to Newton, OK?

103
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally,

104
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
liberal political theory and Newtonian physics.

105
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution

106
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,

107
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and which is still going on.

108
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It was begun with the invention

109
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of relativity theory and quantum theory.

110
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory

111
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,

112
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
something that’s going on right now.

113
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.

114
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This universe is described by being a network of relationships.

115
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say

116
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
absolutely where something is.

117
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.

118
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.

119
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So we call it a relational universe.

120
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.

121
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships,

122
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
your view of the world has to do with what information

123
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
comes to you through the network of relations.

124
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And there’s no place for an omniscient observer

125
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.

126
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.

127
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This is also, if you talk to legal scholars,

128
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.

129
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They’re thinking about the same things.

130
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And not only that, they make the analogy

131
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to relativity theory and cosmology often.

132
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there.

133
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.

134
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe,

135
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which means that there’s no place

136
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to put an explanation for something outside.

137
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So in such a relational universe,

138
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured,

139
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like this device here, or that device there,

140
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or something beautiful, like all the living things,

141
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
all of you guys in the room --

142
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.

143
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

144
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Then you want to know, you’re a person,

145
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you want to know how is it made.

146
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.

147
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
There must be mechanisms of self-organization

148
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
inside the universe that make things.

149
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside,

150
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.

151
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.

152
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization

153
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.

154
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So it works. But not only that,

155
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
if you think about how natural selection works,

156
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
then it turns out that natural selection

157
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
would only make sense in such a relational universe.

158
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That is, natural selection works on properties,

159
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
like fitness, which are about relationships

160
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of some species to some other species.

161
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,

162
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.

163
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So a theory of biology based on natural selection

164
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
requires a relational notion of

165
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what are the properties of biological systems.

166
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And if you push that all the way down, really,

167
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it makes the best sense in a relational universe

168
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
where all properties are relational.

169
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us

170
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that gravity is the result of the world being relational.

171
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life,

172
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,

173
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,

174
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.

175
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
In the 20th century,

176
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.

177
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In the biological sciences, they explored

178
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the implications of the notion that order and complexity

179
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and structure arise in a self-organized way.

180
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.

181
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,

182
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the human sciences, economics, et cetera.

183
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
At the same time, we physicists

184
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
have been busy trying to make sense of

185
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and build on and integrate the discoveries

186
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of quantum theory and relativity.

187
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really,

188
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.

189
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
21st-century science is going to be driven

190
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
by the integration of these two ideas:

191
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the triumph of relational ways of thinking

192
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
about the world, on the one hand,

193
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,

194
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
on the other hand.

195
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And also, is that in the 21st century

196
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
our thinking about space and time and cosmology,

197
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.

198
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And what they’re evolving towards is the union

199
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.

200
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective,

201
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes

202
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that there are many different interests, many different agendas,

203
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
many different individuals, many different points of view.

204
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded

205
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
in a network of relationships.

206
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Any actor in a democracy is embedded

207
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in a network of relationships.

208
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And you understand some things better than other things,

209
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and because of that there’s a continual jostling

210
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and give and take, which is politics.

211
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And politics is, in the ideal sense,

212
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
the way in which we continually address

213
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
our network of relations in order to achieve

214
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
a better life and a better society.

215
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I also think that science will never go away and --

216
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I’m finishing on this line.

217
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Laughter)

218
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.

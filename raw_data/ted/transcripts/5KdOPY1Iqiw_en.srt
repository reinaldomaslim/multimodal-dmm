1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And you should be really afraid,

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but not for the reasons why you think you should be.

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You should be really afraid that --

5
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and

7
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,

8
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.

9
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this is what this adventure's really about.

10
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is crystallized DNA.

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant,

12
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
every animal, every human, every politician -- (Laughter)

13
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is coded in that stuff.

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.

16
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.

18
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant

21
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.

22
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.

23
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It turns out that what this stuff is --

25
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and Richard Dawkins has written about this --

26
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is, this is really a river out of Eden.

27
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells

28
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.

29
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And we could start dating things,

30
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and we could start changing medicine and archeology.

31
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.

33
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
White Europeans were subject to the plague.

34
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,

35
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.

36
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And that mutation was passed on to their kids

37
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because they're the ones that survived,

38
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so there was a great deal of population pressure.

39
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.

41
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We can date it to 700 years ago.

42
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,

43
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and not as fast across Europe.

44
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
for sickle cell, for cancers.

46
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And in the measure that we map ourselves,

47
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,

49
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I want you to toast these two people.

50
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,

51
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and that is almost as important a date

52
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,

53
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but anyway, we'll get to that.

54
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I thought we'd talk about the new zoo.

55
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty

57
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.

58
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,

59
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.

60
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,

61
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is part of the reason

62
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:42,000
why this whole species-mapping project is so important.

63
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because we're just beginning to learn

64
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where we came from and what we are.

65
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.

66
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,

67
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,

68
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which is what makes you you,

69
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
as far as gene code inside each of your cells,

70
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and this little amoeba which, you know,

71
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,

72
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:12,000
turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.

73
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So, this little thingamajig has a genome

74
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that's 200 times the size of yours.

75
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,

76
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it may not turn out to be chips.

77
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.

78
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And, again, we're learning from life and how life works.

79
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This funky little thing: people didn't used to think

80
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors

81
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.

82
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then finally somebody picked up a microscope

83
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.

84
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And sitting next to that water in the cores

85
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,

86
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
having its chromosomes blown apart every day,

87
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
six, seven times, restitching them,

88
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.

89
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse

90
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and how important and how interesting this journey into life is,

91
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and how many different life forms there are,

92
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and how there can be different life forms living in

93
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
very different places, maybe even outside of this planet.

94
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,

95
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.

96
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.

97
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We should have known that this existed

98
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.

99
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.

100
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.

101
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And what you're looking at with this namibiensis

102
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.

103
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.

104
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.

105
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.

106
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.

107
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,

108
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,

109
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and excretes sulfuric acid.

110
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So, when you think of odd life forms,

111
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
when you think of what it takes to live,

112
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
it turns out this is a very efficient life form,

113
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."

114
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up

115
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
when this planet was covered

116
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by things like sulfuric acid in batteries,

117
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.

118
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins

119
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.

120
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Your fear should be that you are not,

121
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.

122
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.

123
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Whether the humans survive or don't survive,

124
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.

125
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA

126
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure

127
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that we've ever been on.

128
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.

129
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Conservation group gets together,

130
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.

131
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is

132
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,

133
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,

134
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.

135
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.

136
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,

137
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and the Australians -- bless their hearts --

138
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
are playing with these things.

139
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.

140
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.

141
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code

142
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and how to reprogram species,

143
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.

144
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,

145
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
then we can put a full string of DNA together.

146
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,

147
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we may give birth to an animal

148
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.

149
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then you can start going back further,

150
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and you can start thinking about dodos,

151
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and you can think about other species.

152
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out

153
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
what the primordial ancestor is.

154
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Because each of us contains our entire gene code

155
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of where we've been for the past billion years,

156
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
because we've evolved from that stuff,

157
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,

158
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,

159
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
maybe we'll give birth to something

160
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that is very close to the first primordial ooze.

161
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it's all coming out of things that look like this.

162
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.

163
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.

164
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Some are public. Some are private.

165
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.

166
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.

167
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.

168
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.

169
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it will be really boring. It will read like this.

170
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.

172
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.

173
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,

174
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.

175
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.

176
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,

177
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and this apple works the same way.

178
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.

179
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because this thing codes ones and zeros,

180
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,

181
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day

182
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?

183
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

184
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,

185
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,

186
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.

187
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Next line of code: make a stem.

188
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,

189
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.

190
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
In the measure that you have the code

191
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and the measure that you read it --

192
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;

193
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the first human was read two years ago;

194
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the first insect was read two years ago.

195
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The first thing that we ever read was in 1995:

196
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.

197
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,

198
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms

199
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,

200
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,

201
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester

202
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that feels like silk in corn.

203
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.

204
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.

205
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And what you can do now is,

206
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,

207
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,

208
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,

209
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and then you can tie it to the literature.

210
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,

211
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and get on the Internet, and access

212
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.

213
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And you can do some pretty strange things

214
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,

215
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,

216
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.

217
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.

218
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

219
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings

220
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,

221
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.

222
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Not so in human beings:

223
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.

224
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,

225
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research

226
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and if we don't stop genomic research,

227
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to express different body functions.

228
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,

229
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,

230
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
one of the things we're going to be able to do

231
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,

232
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and one of the things we're going to learn how to do

233
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is how to reprogram cells like stem cells

234
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.

235
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --

236
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,

237
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.

238
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
How's this stuff work? If each of you differs

239
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,

240
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,

241
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
very small differences in expression and punctuation

242
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.

243
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Laughter)

244
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Right?

245
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,

246
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and they look at that sentence, and they read this.

247
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Okay?

248
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.

249
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This is the way it should be seen.

250
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

251
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That's what your genes are doing.

252
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.

253
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...

254
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I won't go there.

255
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.

256
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:,000
You can look at this, right?

257
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And they look at the world a little differently.

258
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They look at the same world and they say...

259
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Laughter)

260
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:14,000
That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,

261
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.

262
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.

263
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You can make very small changes in gene code

264
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and get really different outcomes,

265
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
even with the same string of letters.

266
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
That's what your genes are doing every day.

267
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
That's why sometimes a person's genes

268
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
don't have to change a lot to get cancer.

269
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:46,000
These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.

270
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.

271
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
That brings up questions of privacy and insurability

272
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,

273
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,

274
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
it turns out that three diseases with

275
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:06,000
completely similar clinical syndromes

276
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
are completely different diseases.

277
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.

278
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,

279
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.

280
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,

281
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
then you take Gleevec and you're cured.

282
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
If it is not expressing in your body,

283
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
if you don't have one of those types --

284
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:3,000
a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.

285
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It won't do anything for you.

286
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.

287
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.

288
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.

289
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Changes the way medicine works.

290
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college

291
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
was this thing, and it turns out that

292
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
this is not so important any more.

293
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,

294
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:59,000
contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company

295
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
every month on a compound basis.

296
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Let me say that again: A single genomics company

297
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
generates more data in a month, on a compound basis,

298
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.

299
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.

300
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months

301
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and the power doubles, right?

302
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed

303
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,

304
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.

305
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.

306
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:43,000
This is going to push computers to have to grow faster

307
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
than they've been growing, because so far,

308
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
there haven't been applications that have been required

309
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.

310
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And here's an interesting map.

311
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:57,000
This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.

312
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,

313
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:04,000
who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.

314
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits

315
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
moving inside from the United States to the United States;

316
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:14,000
about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;

317
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication

318
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:21,000
between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.

319
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:26,000
It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;

320
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.

321
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.

322
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:38,000
That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.

323
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.

324
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:42,000
You can break this out by states.

325
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on

326
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:46,000
their ability to speak a language of life,

327
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,

328
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,

329
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.

330
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.

331
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And if you want to get more specific,

332
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
it's actually specific zip codes.

333
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:03,000
(Laughter)

334
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
So, you want to know where life is happening?

335
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.

336
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,

337
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and it's called Torrey Pines Road.

338
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:22,000
That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;

339
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:24,000
it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;

340
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country

341
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
in about three or four carefully picked 747s.

342
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --

343
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.

344
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:41,000
What's the net effect of this?

345
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:43,000
In an agricultural society, the difference between

346
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:44,000
the richest and the poorest,

347
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:49,000
the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?

348
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids

349
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,

350
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:56,000
you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,

351
0:18:56,000 --> 0:18:57,000
than your neighbor.

352
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:01,000
In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.

353
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:06,000
It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing

354
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
in English and French and German,

355
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:1,000
but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.

356
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.

357
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:17,000
So, if there is something you should fear,

358
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.

359
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Because it really matters who speaks life.

360
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:25,000
That's why nations rise and fall.

361
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,

362
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:32,000
the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.

363
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,

364
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:38,000
and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --

365
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.

366
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation

367
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:49,000
on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth

368
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:51,000
per person per year than America.

369
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.

370
0:19:56,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.

371
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Here's differential productivity rates.

372
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.

373
0:20:09,000 --> 0:20:13,000
So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,

374
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:16,000
790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?

375
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
It's got nothing to do with inflation.

376
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:2,000
It's got nothing to do with privatization.

377
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:24,000
You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,

378
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:27,000
stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country

379
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:29,000
because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.

380
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:33,000
Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.

381
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Well, watch what happens to India.

382
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:38,000
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy

383
0:20:38,000 --> 0:20:43,000
just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.

384
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:47,000
Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth

385
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:5,000
because they didn't get this change,

386
0:20:5,000 --> 0:20:52,000
because they kept treating their people like serfs

387
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:55,000
instead of like shareholders of a common project.

388
0:20:56,000 --> 0:20:59,000
They didn't keep the people who were educated.

389
0:20:59,000 --> 0:21:01,000
They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.

390
0:21:02,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say

391
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:08,000
that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.

392
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:12,000
Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.

393
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:16,000
(Laughter)

394
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
Here's what's happening in the world.

395
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:21,000
It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,

396
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:23,000
when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.

397
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:26,000
It turns out there's now about 192.

398
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --

399
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:36,000
and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.

400
0:21:36,000 --> 0:21:39,000
In the 1990s, these are sovereign states

401
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:41,000
that did not exist before 1990.

402
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.

403
0:21:46,000 --> 0:21:49,000
We're generating about 3.12 states per year.

404
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:52,000
People are taking control of their own states,

405
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:55,000
sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

406
0:21:55,000 --> 0:21:57,000
And the really interesting thing is,

407
0:21:57,000 --> 0:21:59,000
you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,

408
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:01,000
and you don't need a lot to do it.

409
0:22:01,000 --> 0:22:03,000
(Music)

410
0:22:03,000 --> 0:22:06,000
And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk

411
0:22:06,000 --> 0:22:09,000
about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,

412
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:11,000
and how code works.

413
0:22:11,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Moderator: Two minutes.

414
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:14,000
(Laughter)

415
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:18,000
Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year

416
0:22:18,000 --> 0:22:2,000
because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.

417
0:22:21,000 --> 0:22:22,000
But thank you very much.

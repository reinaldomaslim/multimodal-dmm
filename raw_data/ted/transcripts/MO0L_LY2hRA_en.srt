1
0:00:12.976,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As a conceptual artist,

2
0:00:14.394,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations.

3
0:00:18.726,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance.

4
0:00:22.449,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But regardless of the format,

5
0:00:23.912,000 --> 0:00:26,000
two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.

6
0:00:27.796,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"

7
0:00:30.259,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,

8
0:00:32.057,000 --> 0:00:35,000
600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom.

9
0:00:35.937,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence

10
0:00:39.43,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and for purity of mind and spirit.

11
0:00:41.882,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But a closer look at this lotus

12
0:00:44.327,000 --> 0:00:47,000
reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

13
0:00:47.985,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual

14
0:00:51.684,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery.

15
0:00:56.104,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In America, we don't like to talk about slavery,

16
0:00:58.533,000 --> 0:01:,000
nor do we look at it as a global industry.

17
0:01:01.397,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But by using this Buddhist symbol,

18
0:01:03.049,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I hope to universalize and transcend

19
0:01:05.676,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the history and trauma of black America

20
0:01:08.089,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and encourage discussions about our shared past.

21
0:01:12.033,000 --> 0:01:16,000
To create "Lotus," we carved over 6,000 figures.

22
0:01:16.469,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And this later led to a commission by the City of New York

23
0:01:19.216,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to create a 28-foot version in steel

24
0:01:21.494,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,

25
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
a school for black and latino students,

26
0:01:27.122,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the two groups most affected by this history.

27
0:01:30.244,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon,

28
0:01:33.819,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but let me digress.

29
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I've been collecting wooden African figures

30
0:01:38.031,000 --> 0:01:4,000
from tourist shops and flea markets around the world.

31
0:01:40.539,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable,

32
0:01:43.645,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but people believe these to be imbued with power,

33
0:01:46.327,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or even magic.

34
0:01:47.683,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Only recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work.

35
0:01:51.412,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Gun shots)

36
0:02:05.253,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Since 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin,

37
0:02:09.445,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice

38
0:02:13.209,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and literally countless other unarmed black citizens

39
0:02:16.193,000 --> 0:02:17,000
at the hands of the police,

40
0:02:17.646,000 --> 0:02:19,000
who frequently walk away with no punishment at all.

41
0:02:20.775,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In consideration of these victims

42
0:02:22.828,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and the several times that even I,

43
0:02:24.662,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,

44
0:02:27.159,000 --> 0:02:3,000
have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police.

45
0:02:30.647,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I created this body of work simply entitled "BAM."

46
0:02:36.389,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It was important to erase the identity of each of these figures,

47
0:02:39.912,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to make them all look the same and easier to disregard.

48
0:02:43.685,000 --> 0:02:45,000
To do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax

49
0:02:45.909,000 --> 0:02:46,000
before taking them to a shooting range

50
0:02:47.896,000 --> 0:02:49,000
where I re-sculpted them using bullets.

51
0:02:51.098,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And it was fun,

52
0:02:52.303,000 --> 0:02:54,000
playing with big guns and high-speed video cameras.

53
0:02:55.164,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger,

54
0:02:58.845,000 --> 0:03:,000
somehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself.

55
0:03:01.995,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots.

56
0:03:06.503,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I then took the fragments of these

57
0:03:08.396,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and created molds, and cast them first in wax,

58
0:03:12.749,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and finally in bronze like the image you see here,

59
0:03:15.876,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which bears the marks of its violent creation

60
0:03:18.004,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like battle wounds or scars.

61
0:03:20.583,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When I showed this work recently in Miami,

62
0:03:22.615,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul.

63
0:03:25.424,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But she also felt that these artworks

64
0:03:28.039,000 --> 0:03:3,000
memorialized the victims of these killings

65
0:03:30.063,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history.

66
0:03:33.812,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger than just US history.

67
0:03:36.87,000 --> 0:03:37,000
While showing in Berlin last year,

68
0:03:38.758,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings.

69
0:03:42.343,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard

70
0:03:44.985,000 --> 0:03:45,000
from the early 1900s

71
0:03:46.374,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years.

72
0:03:51.922,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But it's only through questions like his

73
0:03:53.852,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race

74
0:03:56.718,000 --> 0:03:58,000
can we evolve as individuals and society.

75
0:03:59.709,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I hope my artwork creates a safe space

76
0:04:02.566,000 --> 0:04:04,000
for this type of honest exchange

77
0:04:05.002,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and an opportunity for people to engage one another

78
0:04:07.765,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in real and necessary conversation.

79
0:04:10.751,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Thank you.

80
0:04:11.925,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Applause)

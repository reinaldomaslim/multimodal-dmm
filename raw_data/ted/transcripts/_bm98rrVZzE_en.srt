1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I'd like to tell you a story about climate and change,

2
0:00:16.68,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but it's really a story about people and not polar bears.

3
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So this is our house that we lived in in the mid-2000s.

4
0:00:24.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was the chief operating officer for the Navy's weather and ocean service.

5
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It happened to be down at a place called Stennis Space Center

6
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
right on the Gulf Coast,

7
0:00:33.2,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so we lived in a little town called Waveland, Mississippi,

8
0:00:35.939,000 --> 0:00:38,000
nice modest house, and as you can see, it's up against a storm surge.

9
0:00:39.48,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, if you ever wonder

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
what a 30-foot or nine-meter storm surge does

11
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
coming up your street,

12
0:00:47.72,000 --> 0:00:48,000
let me show you.

13
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Same house.

14
0:00:50.72,000 --> 0:00:53,000
That's me, kind of wondering what's next.

15
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But when we say we lost our house -- this is, like, right after Katrina --

16
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
so the house is either all the way up there in the railway tracks,

17
0:01:01.64,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or it's somewhere down there in the Gulf of Mexico,

18
0:01:04.48,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and to this day, we really, we lost our house.

19
0:01:06.68,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We don't know where it is.

20
0:01:07.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:09.24,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You know, it's gone.

22
0:01:11.12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So I don't show this for pity,

23
0:01:16.04,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because in many ways, we were the luckiest people on the Gulf Coast.

24
0:01:20.48,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One of the things is, we had insurance,

25
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and that idea of insurance is probably pretty important there.

26
0:01:27.8,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But does this scale up, you know, what happened here?

27
0:01:30.76,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I think it kind of does, because as you've heard,

28
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as the sea levels come up,

29
0:01:35.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it takes weaker and weaker storms to do something like this.

30
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So let's just step back for a second and kind of look at this.

31
0:01:43.6,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And, you know, climate's really complicated,

32
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
a lot of moving parts in this,

33
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but I kind of put it about it's all about the water.

34
0:01:51.92,000 --> 0:01:54,000
See, see those three blue dots there down on the lower part?

35
0:01:55.32,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The one you can easily see, that's all the water in the world.

36
0:01:58.64,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Those two smaller dots, those are the fresh water.

37
0:02:02.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it turns out that as the climate changes,

38
0:02:05.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the distribution of that water is changing very fundamentally.

39
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So now we have too much, too little, wrong place, wrong time.

40
0:02:12.76,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's salty where it should be fresh; it's liquid where it should be frozen;

41
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it's wet where it should be dry;

42
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and in fact, the very chemistry of the ocean itself is changing.

43
0:02:22.759,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And what that does from a security or a military part

44
0:02:27.72,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is it does three things:

45
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it changes the very operating environment that we're working in,

46
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it threatens our bases,

47
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and then it has geostrategic risks, which sounds kind of fancy

48
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I'll explain what I mean by that in a second.

49
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So let's go to just a couple examples here.

50
0:02:45.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And we'll start off with what we all know

51
0:02:47.76,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is of course a political and humanitarian catastrophe

52
0:02:50.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that is Syria.

53
0:02:52.4,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And it turns out that climate was one of the causes

54
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in a long chain of events.

55
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It actually started back in the 1970s.

56
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
When Assad took control over Syria,

57
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:1,000
he decided he wanted to be self-sufficient in things like wheat and barley.

58
0:03:10.4,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now, you would like to think

59
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that there was somebody in Assad's office that said,

60
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Hey boss, you know, we're in the eastern Mediterranean,

61
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:2,000
kind of dry here, maybe not the best idea."

62
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But I think what happened was,

63
0:03:22.64,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"Boss, you are a smart, powerful and handsome man. We'll get right on it."

64
0:03:26.76,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And they did.

65
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So by the '90s, believe it or not,

66
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:34,000
they were actually self-sufficient in food,

67
0:03:35.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but they did it at a great cost.

68
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They did it at a cost of their aquifers,

69
0:03:38.96,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they did it at a cost of their surface water.

70
0:03:41.12,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And of course, there are many nonclimate issues

71
0:03:43.36,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that also contributed to Syria.

72
0:03:45.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There was the Iraq War,

73
0:03:46.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and as you can see by that lower blue line there,

74
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
over a million refugees come into the cities.

75
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then about a decade ago,

76
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
there's this tremendous heat wave and drought --

77
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
fingerprints all over that show,

78
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
yes, this is in fact related to the changing climate --

79
0:04:02.24,000 --> 0:04:04,000
has put another three quarters of a million farmers

80
0:04:05.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
into those same cities.

81
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Why? Because they had nothing.

82
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:12,000
They had dust. They had dirt. They had nothing.

83
0:04:13.2,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So now they're in the cities,

84
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the Iraqis are in the cities,

85
0:04:16.68,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it's Assad, it's not like he's taking care of his people,

86
0:04:19.8,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and all of a sudden we have just this huge issue here

87
0:04:24.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of massive instability

88
0:04:26.4,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and a breeding ground for extremism.

89
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And this is why in the security community

90
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we call climate change a risk to instability.

91
0:04:34.4,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It accelerates instability here.

92
0:04:36.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In plain English, it makes bad places worse.

93
0:04:40.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So let's go to another place here.

94
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now we're going to go 2,000 kilometers, or about 1,200 miles, north of Oslo,

95
0:04:46.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
only 600 miles from the Pole,

96
0:04:49.08,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and this is arguably

97
0:04:51.64,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the most strategic island you've never heard of.

98
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's a place called Svalbard.

99
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It sits astride the sea lanes

100
0:04:57.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that the Russian Northern Fleet needs to get out and go into warmer waters.

101
0:05:03.04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It is also, by virtue of its geography,

102
0:05:06.04,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a place where you can control every single polar orbiting satellite

103
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:1,000
on every orbit.

104
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It is the strategic high ground of space.

105
0:05:13.52,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Climate change has greatly reduced the sea ice around here,

106
0:05:16.8,000 --> 0:05:18,000
greatly increasing human activity,

107
0:05:19.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it's becoming a flashpoint,

108
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and in fact the NATO Parliamentary Assembly

109
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is going to meet here on Svalbard next month.

110
0:05:26.28,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The Russians are very, very unhappy about that.

111
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So if you want to find a flashpoint in the Arctic,

112
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
look at Svalbard there.

113
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, in the military,

114
0:05:36.24,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we have known for decades, if not centuries,

115
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that the time to prepare,

116
0:05:40.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
whether it's for a hurricane, a typhoon or strategic changes,

117
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is before they hit you,

118
0:05:46.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and Admiral Nimitz was right there.

119
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
That is the time to prepare.

120
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Fortunately, our Secretary of Defense,

121
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Secretary Mattis, he understands that as well,

122
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and what he understands is that climate is a risk.

123
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
He has said so in his written responses to Congress,

124
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and he says, "As Secretary of Defense,

125
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it's my job to manage such risks."

126
0:06:06.76,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's not only the US military that understands this.

127
0:06:10.72,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Many of our friends and allies in other navies and other militaries

128
0:06:14.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
have very clear-eyed views about the climate risk.

129
0:06:18.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And in fact, in 2014, I was honored to speak for a half-a-day seminar

130
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
at the International Seapower Symposium

131
0:06:24.64,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to 70 heads of navies about this issue.

132
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So Winston Churchill is alleged to have said,

133
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm not sure if he said anything, but he's alleged to have said

134
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that Americans can always be counted upon to do the right thing

135
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:41,000
after exhausting every other possibility.

136
0:06:41.12,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:42.72,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So I would argue we're still in the process

138
0:06:44.96,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of exhausting every other possibility,

139
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but I do think we will prevail.

140
0:06:49.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But I need your help.

141
0:06:50.92,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is my ask.

142
0:06:52.2,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I ask not that you take your recycling out on Wednesday,

143
0:06:55.68,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but that you engage with every business leader,

144
0:06:58.68,000 --> 0:07:,000
every technology leader, every government leader,

145
0:07:01.52,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and ask them, "Ma'am, sir,

146
0:07:04.12,000 --> 0:07:06,000
what are you doing to stabilize the climate?"

147
0:07:07.52,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's just that simple.

148
0:07:09.08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Because when enough people care enough,

149
0:07:12.6,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the politicians, most of whom won't lead on this issue --

150
0:07:16.2,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but they will be led --

151
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that will change this.

152
0:07:19.4,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Because I can tell you, the ice doesn't care.

153
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The ice doesn't care who's in the White House.

154
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It doesn't care which party controls your congress.

155
0:07:28.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It doesn't care which party controls your parliament.

156
0:07:31.52,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It just melts.

157
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Thank you very much.

158
0:07:34.24,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
No, I'm just joking.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's interesting, because it was six years ago

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when I was pregnant with my first child

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that I discovered

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that the most commonly used preservative

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in baby care products

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
mimics estrogen

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when it gets into the human body.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now it's very easy actually

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to get a chemical compound from products

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
into the human body through the skin.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And these preservatives had been found

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in breast cancer tumors.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That was the start of my journey

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to make this film, "Toxic Baby."

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And it doesn't take much time

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to discover some really astonishing statistics

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with this issue.

20
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
One is that you and I all have

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
between 30 to 50,000 chemicals

22
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in our bodies

23
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that our grandparents didn't have.

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And many of these chemicals

25
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of chronic childhood disease

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that we're seeing across industrialized nations.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'll show you some statistics.

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So for example, in the United Kingdom,

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the incidence of childhood leukemia

31
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That's a four-fold increase.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Again, similar story around the world.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In the United States,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
probably the most astonishing statistic

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is a 600 percent increase

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in autism and autistic spectrum disorders

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and other learning disabilities.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Again, we're seeing that trend

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
across Europe, across North America.

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And in Europe,

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there's certain parts of Europe,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where we're seeing a four-fold increase

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in certain genital birth defects.

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Interestingly, one of those birth defects

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So a real skyrocketing

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of chronic childhood disease

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that includes other things

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like obesity and juvenile diabetes,

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
premature puberty.

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So it's interesting for me,

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and talk to an audience about these things,

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that probably one of the most important people in the world

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who can discuss toxicity in babies

59
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is expert in frogs.

60
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that I would be talking about pesticides,

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that I'd be talking about public health,

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Frogs.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was sort of a surprise as well

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and they asked me if I would evaluate

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for the largest chemical company in the world.

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's the number one contaminant

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but in that same year,

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We were a bit surprised when we found out

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that when we exposed frogs

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that it produced animals that look like this.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
These are the dissected gonads of an animal

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that has two testes, two ovaries,

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
another large testis, more ovaries,

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which is not normal ...

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
even for amphibians.

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
bursting through the surface of this male's testes.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
would probably be somewhere in the top five.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In recent studies that we've published,

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
some of the males grow up

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and completely become females.

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
even though they're genetic males.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
What we proposed,

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and what we've now generated support for,

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is that what atrazine is doing

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.

111
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Normally the testes should make testosterone,

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the male hormone.

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the machinery if you will, aromatase,

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that converts testosterone into estrogen.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And as a result, these exposed males

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they're subsequently feminized

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because now they're making the female hormone.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Because it turns out

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and that estrogen turns on or promotes

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the growth of that cancer

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that the latest treatment for breast cancer

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is a chemical called letrozole,

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now what's interesting is, of course,

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
turns on aromatase, increases estrogen

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and promotes tumors in rats

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What's interesting is, in fact,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the breast cancer promoter,

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so I find it interesting

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that instead of treating this disease

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we simply respond

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
by putting more chemicals into the environment.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
PJC: So speaking of estrogen,

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is something called bisphenol A, BPA,

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which has been in the news recently.

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's a plasticizer.

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which is what baby bottles are made out of.

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And what's interesting about BPA

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is that it's such a potent estrogen

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that it was actually once considered for use

159
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that BPA leaches from babies' bottles

162
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
into the formula, into the milk,

163
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and therefore into the babies.

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So we're dosing our babies,

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
our newborns, our infants,

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with a synthetic estrogen.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now two weeks ago or so,

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the European Union passed a law

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
banning the use of BPA

170
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And for those of you who are not parents,

172
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
sippy cups are those little plastic things

173
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that your child graduates to after using bottles.

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But just two weeks before that,

175
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the U.S. Senate refused to even debate

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the banning of BPA

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So it really makes you realize

179
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the onus on parents

180
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to have to look at this and regulate this and police this

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in their own lives

182
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and how astonishing that is.

183
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles

184
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,

185
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it really shows how sometimes

186
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it is only a parent's awareness

187
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that stands between chemicals and our children.

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The baby bottle scenario proves

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.

190
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
However, if we parents are unaware,

191
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we are leaving our children

192
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to fend for themselves.

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
TH: And what Penelope says here

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is even more true.

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Scientists agree now.

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We are losing species from the Earth

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and leading that loss are amphibians.

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
80 percent of all amphibians

201
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
are threatened and in come decline.

202
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I believe, many scientists believe

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that pesticides are an important part of that decline.

204
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive

205
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --

206
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
no eggshells, no membranes

207
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and no placenta.

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
one of our big inventions was the placenta.

210
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.

211
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But it turns out that this ancient structure

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that separates us from other animals, the placenta,

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
cannot evolve or adapt fast enough

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that it's never seen before.

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,

217
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

219
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Of those rats that don't abort,

220
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
atrazine causes prostate disease

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in the pups so the sons

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are born with an old man's disease.

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Of those that don't abort,

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development

225
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in the exposed daughters in utero,

226
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so that their breast don't develop properly.

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And as a result, when those rats grow up,

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
their pups experience retarded growth and development

229
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine

231
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that its grandmother was exposed to.

232
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And given the life of many of these chemicals,

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
generations, years, dozens of years,

234
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that means that we right now

235
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are affecting the health

236
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
by things that we're putting into the environment today.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

240
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
PCBs, DDT

241
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
cross the placenta

242
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and effectively determine

243
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
the likelihood of developing breast cancer

244
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and obesity and diabetes

245
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
already when the baby's in the womb.

246
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In addition to that, after the baby's born,

247
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
our other unique invention as mammals

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We already know that chemicals

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
like DDT and DES and atrazine

251
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
can also pass over into milk,

252
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
again, affecting our babies

253
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
even after their born.

254
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
PJC: So when Tyrone tells me

255
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that the placenta is an ancient organ,

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?

257
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
How do you show that?

258
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And it's interesting when you make a film like this,

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
because you're stuck trying to visualize science

260
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that there's no visualization for.

261
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Video) (Ringing)

263
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Old man: Placenta control.

264
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
What is it?

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Oh what?

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Snoring)

267
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Honk)

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Puffuffuff, what?

269
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Perflourooctanoic acid.

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Blimey.

271
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Never heard of it.

272
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
PJC: And neither had I actually

273
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
before I started making this film.

274
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta

275
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and go into your unborn child,

276
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it made me start to think,

277
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
what would my fetus say to me?

278
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
What would our unborn children say to us

279
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when they have an exposure

280
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that's happening everyday, day after day?

281
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Music)

282
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Video) Child: Today,

283
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I had some octyphenols,

284
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
some artificial musks

285
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and some bisphenol A.

286
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Help me.

287
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
PJC: It's a very profound notion

288
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to know that we as women

289
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
are at the vanguard of this.

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This is our issue,

291
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because we collect these compounds our entire life

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and then we end up dumping it and dumping them

293
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
into our unborn children.

294
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We are in effect

295
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
polluting our children.

296
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago

297
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
when I found out I was pregnant

298
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and the first scan revealed

299
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that my baby had a birth defect

300
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
associated with exposure

301
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to estrogenic chemicals in the womb

302
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and the second scan

303
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
revealed no heartbeat.

304
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So my child's death, my baby's death,

305
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.

306
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And it's sometimes a weird place

307
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
when the communicator becomes part of the story,

308
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which is not what you originally intend.

309
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And so when Tyrone talks about

310
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,

311
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
this is my contaminated environment.

312
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This is my toxic baby.

313
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And that's something

314
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that's just profound and sad,

315
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but astonishing

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because so many of us don't actually know this.

317
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate

318
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for me to be here at TEDWomen

319
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner

320
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,

321
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"

322
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The truth is, women,

323
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,

324
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"

325
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"

326
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to Sandra Steingraber's books

327
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."

328
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --

329
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --

330
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
perhaps it's that connection

331
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that makes women activists

332
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in this particular area.

333
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But for the men here, I want to say

334
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
it's not just women and children that are at risk.

335
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,

336
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the testes are full of holes and spaces,

337
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because the hormone imbalance,

338
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
instead of allowing sperm to be generated,

339
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
such as in the testis here,

340
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the testicular tubules end up empty

341
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.

342
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It's not just my work in amphibians,

343
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,

344
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America

345
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and in rats, an absence of sperm

346
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in the testicular tubules as well.

347
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,

348
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but just by coincidence,

349
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
my colleague has shown

350
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality

351
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
have significantly more atrazine in their urine.

352
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
These are just men who live

353
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
in an agricultural community.

354
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Men who actually work in agriculture

355
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
have much higher levels of atrazine.

356
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And the men who actually apply atrazine

357
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
have even more atrazine in their urine,

358
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active

359
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
are present in the urine of these men.

360
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

361
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.

362
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,

363
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
which was originally used as a nerve gas.

364
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And many of these workers

365
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
have life expectancies of only 50.

366
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife

367
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
are also a warning to us,

368
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.

369
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,

370
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the agricultural runoff from this crop,

371
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
which goes into these buckets,

372
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.

373
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Now if I told the men in this village

374
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that the frogs have pour immune function

375
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and eggs developing in their testes,

376
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the connection between environmental health and public health

377
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
would be clear.

378
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact

379
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
on the wildlife that lived in it.

380
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
The problem is, in my village, Oakland,

381
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
in most of our villages,

382
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
we don't see that connection.

383
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,

384
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and we assume that we are masters of our environment,

385
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
rather than being part of it.

386
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize

387
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that actually this is an environmental issue.

388
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I kept thinking over and over again

389
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
this question.

390
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
We know so much about global warming and climate change,

391
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and yet, we have no concept

392
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.

393
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We know what we're putting out there,

394
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we have a sense of those repercussions,

395
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
but we are so ignorant of this sense

396
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
of what happens when we put things, or things are put

397
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
into our bodies.

398
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And it's my feeling

399
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and it's my urging being here

400
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
to know that, as we women move forward

401
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
as the communicators of this,

402
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but also as the ones who carry that burden

403
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
of carrying the children, bearing the children,

404
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
we hold most of the buying power in the household,

405
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
is that it's going to be us moving forward

406
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And my urging is

408
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that when we think about environmental issues

409
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,

410
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
but it's also about our children as well.

411
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Thank you.

412
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
(Applause)

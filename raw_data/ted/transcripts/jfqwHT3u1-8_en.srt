Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:16.7,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Openness. It's a word that

3
0:00:19.065,000 --> 0:00:22,000
denotes opportunity and possibilities.

4
0:00:22.144,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Open-ended, open hearth,

5
0:00:24.184,000 --> 0:00:27,000
open source, open door policy,

6
0:00:27.537,000 --> 0:00:3,000
open bar. (Laughter)

7
0:00:31.073,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And everywhere the world is opening up,

8
0:00:33.593,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's a good thing.

9
0:00:35.093,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Why is this happening?

10
0:00:36.869,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The technology revolution is opening the world.

11
0:00:39.833,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Yesterday's Internet was a platform

12
0:00:42.378,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for the presentation of content.

13
0:00:44.97,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The Internet of today is a platform for computation.

14
0:00:48.225,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The Internet is becoming a giant

15
0:00:49.832,000 --> 0:00:51,000
global computer, and every time you go on it,

16
0:00:52.433,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you upload a video, you do a Google search,

17
0:00:55.09,000 --> 0:00:56,000
you remix something,

18
0:00:56.744,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you're programming this big global computer

19
0:00:59.291,000 --> 0:01:,000
that we all share.

20
0:01:00.531,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Humanity is building a machine,

21
0:01:03.765,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and this enables us to collaborate in new ways.

22
0:01:06.839,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Collaboration can occur on

23
0:01:08.155,000 --> 0:01:1,000
an astronomical basis.

24
0:01:11.129,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.

25
0:01:14.537,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I started studying kids about 15 years ago,

26
0:01:17.226,000 --> 0:01:18,000
-- so actually 20 years ago now --

27
0:01:19.185,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I noticed how my own children were

28
0:01:20.78,000 --> 0:01:23,000
effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,

29
0:01:24.297,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and at first I thought,

30
0:01:25.514,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)

31
0:01:28.479,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But then I noticed all their friends were like them,

32
0:01:30.605,000 --> 0:01:31,000
so that was a bad theory.

33
0:01:32.549,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I've started working with a few hundred kids,

34
0:01:35.544,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I came to the conclusion

35
0:01:37.139,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that this is the first generation to come of age

36
0:01:39.197,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the digital age,

37
0:01:40.331,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to be bathed in bits.

38
0:01:41.952,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I call them the Net Generation.

39
0:01:44.288,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I said, these kids are different.

40
0:01:45.638,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.

41
0:01:48.516,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's like the air.

42
0:01:49.977,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.

43
0:01:53.8,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And — (Laughter)

44
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And there's no more powerful force to change

45
0:01:58.168,000 --> 0:02:02,000
every institution than the first generation of digital natives.

46
0:02:02.876,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm a digital immigrant.

47
0:02:04.23,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I had to learn the language.

48
0:02:07.171,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.

49
0:02:10.44,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,

50
0:02:13.47,000 --> 0:02:15,000
everything from old models of the corporation,

51
0:02:15.839,000 --> 0:02:17,000
government, media, Wall Street,

52
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are in various stages of being stalled or frozen

53
0:02:21.896,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or in atrophy or even failing,

54
0:02:24.822,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.

55
0:02:27.832,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I mean, think about Wall Street.

56
0:02:29.661,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down

57
0:02:32.872,000 --> 0:02:34,000
global capitalism.

58
0:02:35.37,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform,

59
0:02:36.933,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are

60
0:02:41.103,000 --> 0:02:44,000
become greater than the costs of moving to something different,

61
0:02:44.304,000 --> 0:02:47,000
perhaps something radically different.

62
0:02:47.477,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And we need to change

63
0:02:49.205,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and open up all of our institutions.

64
0:02:51.298,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So this technology push,

65
0:02:52.98,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a demographic kick from a new generation

66
0:02:55.872,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and a demand pull from a new

67
0:02:58.74,000 --> 0:03:,000
economic global environment

68
0:03:01.167,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is causing the world to open up.

69
0:03:02.86,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, I think, in fact,

70
0:03:05.98,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we're at a turning point in human history,

71
0:03:09.183,000 --> 0:03:1,000
where we can finally now rebuild

72
0:03:11.128,000 --> 0:03:13,000
many of the institutions of the Industrial Age

73
0:03:13.566,000 --> 0:03:14,000
around a new set of principles.

74
0:03:15.123,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, what is openness?

75
0:03:17.487,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, as it turns out, openness

76
0:03:19.062,000 --> 0:03:21,000
has a number of different meanings,

77
0:03:21.304,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and for each there's a corresponding principle

78
0:03:24.207,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for the transformation of

79
0:03:25.876,000 --> 0:03:27,000
civilization.

80
0:03:27.9,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The first is collaboration.

81
0:03:31.175,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries

82
0:03:33.99,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of organizations becoming more porous and fluid

83
0:03:36.949,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and open.

84
0:03:38.813,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The guy in the picture here,

85
0:03:40.349,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'll tell you his story.

86
0:03:41.478,000 --> 0:03:42,000
His name is Rob McEwen.

87
0:03:43.383,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world

88
0:03:45.965,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for amazing case studies."

89
0:03:47.619,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The reason I know this story

90
0:03:49.277,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)

91
0:03:53.438,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He actually moved across the street from us,

92
0:03:55.205,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and he held a cocktail party

93
0:03:56.484,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.

94
0:03:58.929,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I've read some of your books."

95
0:03:59.838,000 --> 0:04:,000
I said, "Great. What do you do?"

96
0:04:00.938,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And he says, "Well I used to be a banker

97
0:04:02.255,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and now I'm a gold miner."

98
0:04:03.703,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And he tells me this amazing story.

99
0:04:06.693,000 --> 0:04:08,000
He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists

100
0:04:09.184,000 --> 0:04:1,000
can't tell him where the gold is.

101
0:04:10.471,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He gives them more money for geological data,

102
0:04:12.198,000 --> 0:04:13,000
they come back, they can't tell

103
0:04:13.827,000 --> 0:04:14,000
him where to go into production.

104
0:04:15.689,000 --> 0:04:18,000
After a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready

105
0:04:19.669,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to give up, but he has an epiphany one day.

106
0:04:22.046,000 --> 0:04:24,000
He wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,

107
0:04:24.82,000 --> 0:04:26,000
maybe somebody else does."

108
0:04:27.19,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So he does a "radical" thing.

109
0:04:29.193,000 --> 0:04:3,000
He takes his geological data,

110
0:04:30.7,000 --> 0:04:32,000
he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet

111
0:04:33.463,000 --> 0:04:34,000
called the Goldcorp Challenge.

112
0:04:34.954,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's basically half a million dollars in prize money

113
0:04:38.534,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,

114
0:04:41.246,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and if so, where is it? (Laughter)

115
0:04:45.182,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He gets submissions from all around the world.

116
0:04:47.329,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They use techniques that he's never heard of,

117
0:04:49.586,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and for his half a million dollars in prize money,

118
0:04:51.754,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.

119
0:04:55.939,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The market value of his company

120
0:04:57.712,000 --> 0:04:59,000
goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,

121
0:05:00.03,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,

122
0:05:02.722,000 --> 0:05:05,000
he's a happy camper. (Laughter)

123
0:05:06.212,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?

124
0:05:09.9,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.

125
0:05:13.011,000 --> 0:05:15,000
He viewed talent differently.

126
0:05:15.516,000 --> 0:05:17,000
He wondered, who are their peers?

127
0:05:17.812,000 --> 0:05:21,000
He should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.

128
0:05:21.881,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You know, some of the best submissions

129
0:05:24.212,000 --> 0:05:26,000
didn't come from geologists.

130
0:05:26.443,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They came from computer scientists, engineers.

131
0:05:28.939,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The winner was a computer graphics company

132
0:05:30.19,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that built a three dimensional model of the mine

133
0:05:32.006,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where you can helicopter underground

134
0:05:33.829,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and see where the gold is.

135
0:05:36.499,000 --> 0:05:39,000
He helped us understand that social media's becoming

136
0:05:39.602,000 --> 0:05:41,000
social production.

137
0:05:41.675,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's not about hooking up online.

138
0:05:43.419,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is a new means of production in the making.

139
0:05:46.494,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,

140
0:05:50.491,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for uniquely qualified minds,

141
0:05:53.49,000 --> 0:05:57,000
was part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure

142
0:05:58.225,000 --> 0:06:,000
and architecture of our organizations,

143
0:06:00.683,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,

144
0:06:04.285,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to create goods and services,

145
0:06:05.985,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to engage with the rest of the world,

146
0:06:07.108,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in terms of government, how we create public value.

147
0:06:11.513,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Openness is about collaboration.

148
0:06:13.499,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now secondly, openness is about transparency.

149
0:06:15.865,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is different. Here, we're talking about the communication

150
0:06:18.055,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:

151
0:06:21.89,000 --> 0:06:23,000
employees, customers, business partners, shareholders,

152
0:06:24.807,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and so on.

153
0:06:26.569,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.

154
0:06:30.842,000 --> 0:06:32,000
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,

155
0:06:33.329,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

156
0:06:35.785,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,

157
0:06:38.49,000 --> 0:06:4,000
not just Julian Assange,

158
0:06:40.715,000 --> 0:06:42,000
have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,

159
0:06:43.306,000 --> 0:06:44,000
scrutinizing, informing others,

160
0:06:44.763,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and even organizing collective responses.

161
0:06:48.353,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Institutions are becoming naked,

162
0:06:50.643,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and if you're going to be naked,

163
0:06:52.45,000 --> 0:06:54,000
well, there's some corollaries that flow from that.

164
0:06:55.165,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I mean, one is,

165
0:06:56.028,000 --> 0:06:58,000
fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)

166
0:06:58.809,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.

167
0:07:03.13,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,

168
0:07:06.595,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because value is evidenced like never before.

169
0:07:08.575,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You say you have good products.

170
0:07:09.539,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They'd better be good.

171
0:07:10.58,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But you also need to have values.

172
0:07:12.531,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You need to have integrity as part of your bones

173
0:07:15.474,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and your DNA as an organization,

174
0:07:17.882,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,

175
0:07:20.355,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.

176
0:07:24.344,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So this is good. It's not bad.

177
0:07:27.615,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

178
0:07:30.31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.

179
0:07:34.293,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, the third meaning and corresponding principle

180
0:07:37.289,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of openness is about sharing.

181
0:07:39.419,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now this is different than transparency.

182
0:07:41.14,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Transparency is about the communication of information.

183
0:07:43.883,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.

184
0:07:48.301,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.

185
0:07:50.571,000 --> 0:07:52,000
IBM gave away 400 million dollars of software

186
0:07:53.508,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to the Linux movement, and that gave them

187
0:07:55.609,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a multi-billion dollar payoff.

188
0:07:58.62,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, conventional wisdom says,

189
0:08:00.58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,

190
0:08:03.315,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out

191
0:08:05.618,000 --> 0:08:07,000
our lawyers and we're going to sue them."

192
0:08:07.966,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?

193
0:08:11.379,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption,

194
0:08:16.483,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and rather than taking a business model innovation

195
0:08:19.172,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution

196
0:08:23.124,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles

197
0:08:25.437,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is now suing children

198
0:08:27.469,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and is in danger of collapse.

199
0:08:31.636,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we need to think differently about intellectual property.

200
0:08:34.477,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I'll give you an example.

201
0:08:35.506,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.

202
0:08:38.388,000 --> 0:08:4,000
First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions

203
0:08:40.993,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,

204
0:08:43.347,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,

205
0:08:48.508,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that they're about to fall off something

206
0:08:50.431,000 --> 0:08:51,000
called the patent cliff.

207
0:08:51.952,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Do you know about this?

208
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue

209
0:08:55.724,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in the next 12 months.

210
0:08:57.351,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And what are you going to do,

211
0:08:58.682,000 --> 0:09:01,000
like, cut back on paper clips or something? No.

212
0:09:01.792,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.

213
0:09:06.505,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets

214
0:09:09.969,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.

215
0:09:13.904,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They need to start sharing

216
0:09:16.247,000 --> 0:09:17,000
clinical trial data,

217
0:09:17.705,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,

218
0:09:21.976,000 --> 0:09:22,000
not just for the industry but

219
0:09:23.918,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for humanity.

220
0:09:26.709,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, the fourth meaning

221
0:09:29.114,000 --> 0:09:31,000
of openness,

222
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and corresponding principle, is about empowerment.

223
0:09:33.259,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.

224
0:09:35.475,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Knowledge and intelligence is power,

225
0:09:38.949,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and as it becomes more distributed, there's a

226
0:09:41.788,000 --> 0:09:43,000
concomitant distribution

227
0:09:44.333,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and decentralization and disaggregation of power

228
0:09:47.964,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that's underway in the world today.

229
0:09:49.893,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The open world is bringing freedom.

230
0:09:52.983,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now, take the Arab Spring.

231
0:09:55.332,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The debate about the role of social media

232
0:09:57.244,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and social change has been settled.

233
0:09:59.238,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You know, one word: Tunisia.

234
0:10:02.476,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.

235
0:10:04.822,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But in the Tunisian revolution,

236
0:10:07.164,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the new media didn't cause the revolution;

237
0:10:09.291,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it was caused by injustice.

238
0:10:11.071,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Social media didn't create the revolution;

239
0:10:15.308,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it was created by a new generation of young people

240
0:10:17.629,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who wanted jobs and hope and

241
0:10:19.437,000 --> 0:10:23,000
who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.

242
0:10:23.463,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration

243
0:10:26.528,000 --> 0:10:28,000
costs in business and government,

244
0:10:28.896,000 --> 0:10:3,000
it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,

245
0:10:31.653,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and even insurrection

246
0:10:33.482,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in ways that people didn't understand.

247
0:10:35.574,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You know, during the Tunisian revolution,

248
0:10:37.397,000 --> 0:10:39,000
snipers associated with the regime were killing

249
0:10:40.091,000 --> 0:10:41,000
unarmed students in the street.

250
0:10:41.835,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So the students would take their mobile devices,

251
0:10:44.856,000 --> 0:10:46,000
take a picture, triangulate the location,

252
0:10:47.509,000 --> 0:10:49,000
send that picture to friendly military units,

253
0:10:49.71,000 --> 0:10:51,000
who'd come in and take out the snipers.

254
0:10:52.119,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You think that social media is about hooking up online?

255
0:10:54.653,000 --> 0:10:57,000
For these kids, it was a military tool

256
0:10:57.68,000 --> 0:11:,000
to defend unarmed people from murderers.

257
0:11:00.806,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It was a tool of self-defense.

258
0:11:02.939,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You know, as we speak today, young people

259
0:11:05.294,000 --> 0:11:07,000
are being killed in Syria,

260
0:11:07.304,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and up until three months ago,

261
0:11:09.114,000 --> 0:11:11,000
if you were injured on the street,

262
0:11:11.313,000 --> 0:11:12,000
an ambulance would pick you up,

263
0:11:12.765,000 --> 0:11:14,000
take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,

264
0:11:15.665,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and you'd come out with a bullet in your head.

265
0:11:18.144,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So these 20-somethings created

266
0:11:21.055,000 --> 0:11:23,000
an alternative health care system,

267
0:11:23.349,000 --> 0:11:25,000
where what they did is they used Twitter and basic

268
0:11:25.739,000 --> 0:11:28,000
publicly available tools that when someone's injured,

269
0:11:28.984,000 --> 0:11:3,000
a car would show up, it would pick them up,

270
0:11:31.664,000 --> 0:11:33,000
take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get

271
0:11:34.223,000 --> 0:11:37,000
medical treatment, as opposed to being executed.

272
0:11:37.765,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So this is a time of great change.

273
0:11:40.95,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Now, it's not without its problems.

274
0:11:43.584,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Up until two years ago,

275
0:11:46.23,000 --> 0:11:49,000
all revolutions in human history had a leadership,

276
0:11:49.383,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and when the old regime fell, the leadership

277
0:11:52.175,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the organization would take power.

278
0:11:53.153,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast

279
0:11:55.678,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they create a vacuum, and

280
0:11:57.176,000 --> 0:11:58,000
politics abhors a vacuum,

281
0:11:58.911,000 --> 0:12:,000
and unsavory forces can fill that,

282
0:12:00.983,000 --> 0:12:03,000
typically the old regime,

283
0:12:04.109,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.

284
0:12:06.455,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You can see this playing out today in Egypt.

285
0:12:09.19,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But that doesn't matter,

286
0:12:10.853,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because this is moving forward.

287
0:12:12.99,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.

288
0:12:15.966,000 --> 0:12:18,000
The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?

289
0:12:19.344,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.

290
0:12:21.486,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I mean, we're not putting this one back.

291
0:12:23.709,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.

292
0:12:27.442,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I think, at the end of these four days,

293
0:12:30.226,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history

294
0:12:32.992,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is a positive one, and it's towards openness.

295
0:12:36.488,000 --> 0:12:38,000
If you go back a few hundred years,

296
0:12:38.969,000 --> 0:12:4,000
all around the world it was a very closed society.

297
0:12:41.353,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It was agrarian, and the means of production

298
0:12:42.922,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and political system was called feudalism, and knowledge

299
0:12:45.637,000 --> 0:12:48,000
was concentrated in the church and the nobility.

300
0:12:49.575,000 --> 0:12:5,000
People didn't know about things.

301
0:12:51.182,000 --> 0:12:53,000
There was no concept of progress.

302
0:12:53.657,000 --> 0:12:54,000
You were born, you lived your life and you died.

303
0:12:55.56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,

304
0:13:00.156,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and, over time, the society opened up.

305
0:13:03.708,000 --> 0:13:05,000
People started to learn about things, and when they did,

306
0:13:05.749,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the institutions of feudal society appeared

307
0:13:07.134,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to be stalled, or frozen, or failing.

308
0:13:10.837,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible

309
0:13:13.613,000 --> 0:13:15,000
for medicine when people had knowledge.

310
0:13:15.895,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So we saw the Protestant Reformation.

311
0:13:17.842,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Martin Luther called the printing press

312
0:13:19.712,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"God's highest act of grace."

313
0:13:22.109,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The creation of a corporation, science, the university,

314
0:13:25.62,000 --> 0:13:26,000
eventually the Industrial Revolution,

315
0:13:27.307,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it was all good.

316
0:13:29.481,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But it came with a cost.

317
0:13:31.628,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And now, once again, the technology genie

318
0:13:34.34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is out of the bottle, but this time it's different.

319
0:13:37.66,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The printing press gave us access to the written word.

320
0:13:40.525,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer.

321
0:13:43.984,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.

322
0:13:46.798,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The Internet gives us access,

323
0:13:48.708,000 --> 0:13:49,000
not just to information and knowledge, but

324
0:13:50.357,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people

325
0:13:53.733,000 --> 0:13:54,000
on a global basis.

326
0:13:55.27,000 --> 0:13:58,000
To me, this is not an information age,

327
0:13:58.509,000 --> 0:14:,000
it's an age of networked intelligence.

328
0:14:01.383,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's an age of vast promise,

329
0:14:05.255,000 --> 0:14:08,000
an age of collaboration,

330
0:14:08.383,000 --> 0:14:12,000
where the boundaries of our organizations are changing,

331
0:14:12.562,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of transparency, where sunlight

332
0:14:15.277,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is disinfecting civilization,

333
0:14:18.5,000 --> 0:14:21,000
an age of sharing and understanding

334
0:14:22.056,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the new power of the commons,

335
0:14:23.762,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and it's an age of empowerment

336
0:14:26.405,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and of freedom.

337
0:14:29.296,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Now, what I'd like to do is,

338
0:14:32.832,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to close, to share with you

339
0:14:35.48,000 --> 0:14:37,000
some research that I've been doing.

340
0:14:38.089,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I've tried to study all kinds of organizations

341
0:14:40.6,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to understand what the future might look like,

342
0:14:43.737,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but I've been studying nature recently.

343
0:14:46.762,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You know, bees come in swarms

344
0:14:50.392,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and fish come in schools.

345
0:14:53.103,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh,

346
0:14:55.916,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the moors of England,

347
0:14:57.399,000 --> 0:14:59,000
come in something called a murmuration,

348
0:14:59.493,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings

349
0:15:02.265,000 --> 0:15:03,000
of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings

350
0:15:04.178,000 --> 0:15:05,000
are out over a 20-mile radius

351
0:15:06.043,000 --> 0:15:08,000
sort of doing their starling thing.

352
0:15:08.084,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And at night they come together

353
0:15:09.848,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and they create one of the most spectacular things

354
0:15:11.97,000 --> 0:15:12,000
in all of nature,

355
0:15:13.565,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and it's called a murmuration.

356
0:15:15.619,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And scientists that have studied this have said

357
0:15:18.536,000 --> 0:15:19,000
they've never seen an accident.

358
0:15:20.282,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now, this thing has a function.

359
0:15:22.232,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It protects the birds.

360
0:15:24.094,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You can see on the right here,

361
0:15:25.694,000 --> 0:15:29,000
there's a predator being chased away by the collective power

362
0:15:30.199,000 --> 0:15:32,000
of the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing

363
0:15:33.189,000 --> 0:15:36,000
if you're a predator of starlings.

364
0:15:36.653,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And there's leadership,

365
0:15:39.101,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but there's no one leader.

366
0:15:41.239,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Now, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,

367
0:15:43.34,000 --> 0:15:45,000
or could we actually learn something from this?

368
0:15:45.786,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Well, the murmuration functions to record

369
0:15:48.842,000 --> 0:15:49,000
a number of principles,

370
0:15:50.205,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and they're basically the principles that

371
0:15:51.724,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I have described to you today.

372
0:15:53.638,000 --> 0:15:55,000
This is a huge collaboration.

373
0:15:56.444,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's an openness, it's a sharing

374
0:15:58.223,000 --> 0:16:,000
of all kinds of information, not just about location

375
0:16:00.738,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.

376
0:16:05.753,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And there's a real sense of interdependence,

377
0:16:09.89,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that the individual birds somehow understand

378
0:16:13.577,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that their interests are in the interest of the collective.

379
0:16:16.536,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Perhaps like we should understand

380
0:16:18.785,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that business can't succeed

381
0:16:22.953,000 --> 0:16:24,000
in a world that's failing.

382
0:16:25.113,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Well, I look at this thing,

383
0:16:26.67,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and I get a lot of hope.

384
0:16:29.357,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and

385
0:16:34.409,000 --> 0:16:36,000
you see something like this that's underway.

386
0:16:37.265,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:

387
0:16:41.405,000 --> 0:16:44,000
What if we could connect ourselves in this world

388
0:16:45.35,000 --> 0:16:48,000
through a vast network of air and glass?

389
0:16:49.195,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?

390
0:16:52.027,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Could we start to share our intelligence?

391
0:16:54.536,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Could we create some kind of

392
0:16:56.978,000 --> 0:16:57,000
collective intelligence

393
0:16:58.699,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team

394
0:17:02.619,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness

395
0:17:06.767,000 --> 0:17:07,000
on a global basis?

396
0:17:07.992,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.

397
0:17:11.665,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And I look at this thing,

398
0:17:13.536,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this

399
0:17:16.451,000 --> 0:17:19,000
smaller, networked, open world

400
0:17:20.247,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that

401
0:17:23.351,000 --> 0:17:26,000
this new age of networked intelligence could be

402
0:17:26.664,000 --> 0:17:28,000
an age of promise fulfilled

403
0:17:29.288,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and of peril unrequited.

404
0:17:32.318,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Let's do this. Thank you.

405
0:17:35.664,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.458,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am a capitalist,

2
0:00:17.458,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and after a 30-year career in capitalism

3
0:00:20.417,000 --> 0:00:22,000
spanning three dozen companies,

4
0:00:22.958,000 --> 0:00:25,000
generating tens of billions of dollars in market value,

5
0:00:26.333,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm not just in the top one percent, I'm in the top .01 percent of all earners.

6
0:00:33.5,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success,

7
0:00:36.542,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because rich capitalists like me have never been richer.

8
0:00:40.75,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So the question is, how do we do it?

9
0:00:44.292,000 --> 0:00:45,000
How do we manage to grab

10
0:00:45.875,000 --> 0:00:48,000
an ever-increasing share of the economic pie every year?

11
0:00:50.875,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago?

12
0:00:55.833,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Is it that we're working harder than we once did?

13
0:00:59.5,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Are we taller, better looking?

14
0:01:03.292,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Sadly, no.

15
0:01:05.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It all comes down to just one thing:

16
0:01:08.167,000 --> 0:01:09,000
economics.

17
0:01:10.25,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Because, here's the dirty secret.

18
0:01:12.667,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There was a time in which the economics profession

19
0:01:15.042,000 --> 0:01:16,000
worked in the public interest,

20
0:01:16.542,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but in the neoliberal era,

21
0:01:18.458,000 --> 0:01:19,000
today,

22
0:01:20.208,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they work only for big corporations

23
0:01:22.667,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and billionaires,

24
0:01:24.25,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and that is creating a little bit of a problem.

25
0:01:27.792,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We could choose to enact economic policies

26
0:01:31.625,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that raise taxes on the rich,

27
0:01:34.417,000 --> 0:01:37,000
regulate powerful corporations or raise wages for workers.

28
0:01:38.292,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We have done it before.

29
0:01:39.833,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But neoliberal economists would warn

30
0:01:42.333,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake,

31
0:01:46.375,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because raising taxes always kills economic growth,

32
0:01:50.083,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and any form of government regulation

33
0:01:52.375,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is inefficient,

34
0:01:54.083,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and raising wages always kills jobs.

35
0:01:57.375,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Well, as a consequence of that thinking,

36
0:02:00.542,000 --> 0:02:04,000
over the last 30 years, in the USA alone,

37
0:02:04.792,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the top one percent has grown 21 trillion dollars richer

38
0:02:09.083,000 --> 0:02:14,000
while the bottom 50 percent have grown 900 billion dollars poorer,

39
0:02:14.542,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a pattern of widening inequality that has largely repeated itself

40
0:02:18.458,000 --> 0:02:19,000
across the world.

41
0:02:19.958,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And yet, as middle class families struggle to get by

42
0:02:24.625,000 --> 0:02:27,000
on wages that have not budged in about 40 years,

43
0:02:28.542,000 --> 0:02:32,000
neoliberal economists continue to warn that the only reasonable response

44
0:02:32.708,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization

45
0:02:36.833,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is even more austerity and globalization.

46
0:02:40.708,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, what is a society to do?

47
0:02:44.833,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do.

48
0:02:47.75,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We need a new economics.

49
0:02:51.167,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, economics has been described as the dismal science,

50
0:02:55.25,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today,

51
0:02:58.375,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it isn't a science at all,

52
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics.

53
0:03:03.417,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners

54
0:03:06.625,000 --> 0:03:11,000
have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong

55
0:03:12.625,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and that today's growing crises of rising inequality

56
0:03:16.25,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and growing political instability

57
0:03:17.958,000 --> 0:03:22,000
are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory.

58
0:03:23.167,000 --> 0:03:28,000
What we now know is that the economics that made me so rich isn't just wrong,

59
0:03:29.167,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it's backwards,

60
0:03:31.208,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because it turns out

61
0:03:33.167,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it isn't capital that creates economic growth,

62
0:03:36.958,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's people;

63
0:03:39.25,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it isn't self-interest that promotes the public good,

64
0:03:44.042,000 --> 0:03:45,000
it's reciprocity;

65
0:03:46.542,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it isn't competition that produces our prosperity,

66
0:03:50.833,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's cooperation.

67
0:03:53.333,000 --> 0:03:58,000
What we can now see is that an economics that is neither just nor inclusive

68
0:03:58.375,000 --> 0:04:02,000
can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation

69
0:04:02.792,000 --> 0:04:04,000
necessary to enable a modern society to thrive.

70
0:04:05.458,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So where did we go wrong?

71
0:04:09.25,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious

72
0:04:13.458,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory

73
0:04:19.5,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are just objectively false,

74
0:04:22.625,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and so today first I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions

75
0:04:26.458,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then after describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from.

76
0:04:33.416,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is

77
0:04:37.583,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that the market is an efficient equilibrium system,

78
0:04:42.042,000 --> 0:04:48,000
which basically means that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up,

79
0:04:48.083,000 --> 0:04:52,000
another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down.

80
0:04:53.333,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So for example, in Seattle, where I live,

81
0:04:56.958,000 --> 0:05:01,000
when in 2014 we passed our nation's first 15 dollar minimum wage,

82
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium.

83
0:05:07.375,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"If you raise the price of labor," they warned,

84
0:05:10.25,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"businesses will purchase less of it.

85
0:05:12.292,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs.

86
0:05:14.833,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The restaurants will close."

87
0:05:16.75,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Except ...

88
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
they didn't.

89
0:05:20.917,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The unemployment rate fell dramatically.

90
0:05:25.125,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.

91
0:05:28.042,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Why?

92
0:05:30.083,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Because there is no equilibrium.

93
0:05:33.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them;

94
0:05:36.75,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because, for instance,

95
0:05:38.25,000 --> 0:05:42,000
when restaurant owners are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough

96
0:05:43.167,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

97
0:05:47.208,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it doesn't shrink the restaurant business,

98
0:05:49.25,000 --> 0:05:51,000
it grows it, obviously.

99
0:05:53.333,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

100
0:05:54.625,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Thank you.

101
0:05:58.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
The second assumption is

102
0:06:01.917,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that the price of something is always equal to its value,

103
0:06:06.917,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which basically means that if you earn 50,000 dollars a year

104
0:06:10.5,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and I earn 50 million dollars a year,

105
0:06:13.458,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that's because I produce a thousand times as much value as you.

106
0:06:18.583,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now,

107
0:06:20.25,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it will not surprise you to learn

108
0:06:23.917,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that this is a very comforting assumption

109
0:06:25.917,000 --> 0:06:27,000
if you're a CEO paying yourself 50 million dollars a year

110
0:06:28.625,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but paying your workers poverty wages.

111
0:06:31.583,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But please, take it from somebody who has run dozens of businesses:

112
0:06:35.75,000 --> 0:06:37,000
this is nonsense.

113
0:06:38.167,000 --> 0:06:4,000
People are not paid what they are worth.

114
0:06:40.583,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They are paid what they have the power to negotiate,

115
0:06:43.875,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and wages' falling share of GDP

116
0:06:46.667,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is not because workers have become less productive

117
0:06:50.208,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but because employers have become more powerful.

118
0:06:54.333,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And --

119
0:06:55.625,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

120
0:06:59.167,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power between capital and labor

121
0:07:04.667,000 --> 0:07:05,000
doesn't exist,

122
0:07:06.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
neoliberal economic theory became essentially

123
0:07:10.083,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a protection racket for the rich.

124
0:07:13.5,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious,

125
0:07:16.042,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is a behavioral model

126
0:07:17.375,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that describes human beings as something called "homo economicus,"

127
0:07:21.25,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish,

128
0:07:26.5,000 --> 0:07:3,000
perfectly rational and relentlessly self-maximizing.

129
0:07:31.958,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But just ask yourselves,

130
0:07:33.583,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is it plausible that every single time for your entire life,

131
0:07:37.417,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when you did something nice for somebody else,

132
0:07:39.625,000 --> 0:07:42,000
all you were doing was maximizing your own utility?

133
0:07:42.917,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade to defend fellow soldiers,

134
0:07:46.792,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they're just promoting their narrow self-interest?

135
0:07:49.542,000 --> 0:07:5,000
If you think that's nuts,

136
0:07:51.375,000 --> 0:07:54,000
contrary to any reasonable moral intuition,

137
0:07:54.5,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that's because it is

138
0:07:56.333,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and, according to the latest science,

139
0:07:58.125,000 --> 0:07:59,000
not true.

140
0:07:59.792,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But it is this behavioral model

141
0:08:02.333,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which is at the cold, cruel heart of neoliberal economics,

142
0:08:05.625,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and it is as morally corrosive

143
0:08:09.333,000 --> 0:08:11,000
as it is scientifically wrong

144
0:08:11.875,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because, if we accept at face value

145
0:08:16.958,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that humans are fundamentally selfish,

146
0:08:19.792,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and then we look around the world

147
0:08:22.042,000 --> 0:08:25,000
at all of the unambiguous prosperity in it,

148
0:08:26.083,000 --> 0:08:28,000
then it follows logically,

149
0:08:28.958,000 --> 0:08:29,000
then it must be true by definition,

150
0:08:30.792,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that billions of individual acts of selfishness

151
0:08:34.667,000 --> 0:08:38,000
magically transubstantiate into prosperity and the common good.

152
0:08:38.708,000 --> 0:08:4,000
If we humans are merely selfish maximizers,

153
0:08:41.625,000 --> 0:08:44,000
then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity.

154
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Under this economic logic,

155
0:08:48.75,000 --> 0:08:49,000
greed is good,

156
0:08:51.667,000 --> 0:08:53,000
widening inequality is efficient,

157
0:08:54.042,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and the only purpose of the corporation

158
0:08:56.417,000 --> 0:08:58,000
can be to enrich shareholders,

159
0:08:58.917,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth

160
0:09:02.042,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and harm the economy overall.

161
0:09:05.333,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And it is this gospel of selfishness

162
0:09:08.75,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics,

163
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
a way of thinking which has produced economic policies

164
0:09:16.667,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which have enabled me and my rich buddies in the top one percent

165
0:09:20.417,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to grab virtually all of the benefits of growth over the last 40 years.

166
0:09:25.083,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But,

167
0:09:26.958,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if instead

168
0:09:29.042,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we accept the latest empirical research,

169
0:09:32.708,000 --> 0:09:35,000
real science, which correctly describes human beings

170
0:09:36.083,000 --> 0:09:39,000
as highly cooperative,

171
0:09:39.292,000 --> 0:09:4,000
reciprocal

172
0:09:40.583,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and intuitively moral creatures,

173
0:09:43.542,000 --> 0:09:45,000
then it follows logically

174
0:09:46.208,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that it must be cooperation

175
0:09:48.75,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and not selfishness

176
0:09:50.375,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that is the cause of our prosperity,

177
0:09:52.167,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and it isn't our self-interest

178
0:09:54.542,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but rather our inherent reciprocity

179
0:09:58.25,000 --> 0:10:,000
that is humanity's economic superpower.

180
0:10:01.833,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So at the heart of this new economics

181
0:10:06.333,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves,

182
0:10:11.125,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and, unlike the old economics,

183
0:10:14.125,000 --> 0:10:16,000
this is a story that is virtuous

184
0:10:16.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and also has the virtue of being true.

185
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now,

186
0:10:22.917,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I want to emphasize that this new economics

187
0:10:25.125,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is not something I have personally imagined or invented.

188
0:10:27.792,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Its theories and models are being developed and refined

189
0:10:30.625,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in universities around the world

190
0:10:32.667,000 --> 0:10:35,000
building on some of the best new research in economics,

191
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:37,000
complexity theory, evolutionary theory,

192
0:10:37.917,000 --> 0:10:4,000
psychology, anthropology and other disciplines.

193
0:10:41.042,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And although this new economics does not yet have its own textbook

194
0:10:45.875,000 --> 0:10:47,000
or even a commonly agreed upon name,

195
0:10:48.25,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in broad strokes

196
0:10:50.292,000 --> 0:10:54,000
its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this.

197
0:10:55.458,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system

198
0:11:00.042,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in which prosperity emerges

199
0:11:02.5,000 --> 0:11:03,000
through a positive feedback loop

200
0:11:04.083,000 --> 0:11:08,000
between increasing amounts of innovation and increasing amounts of consumer demand.

201
0:11:09.042,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems,

202
0:11:14.583,000 --> 0:11:17,000
consumer demand is the mechanism through which the market selects

203
0:11:17.917,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for useful innovations,

204
0:11:20.333,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and as we solve more problems, we become more prosperous.

205
0:11:23.583,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But as we become more prosperous,

206
0:11:27.583,000 --> 0:11:28,000
our problems and solutions

207
0:11:29.417,000 --> 0:11:31,000
become more complex,

208
0:11:32.208,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and this increasing technical complexity

209
0:11:35.375,000 --> 0:11:39,000
requires ever higher levels of social and economic cooperation

210
0:11:39.917,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in order to produce the more highly specialized products

211
0:11:42.833,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that define a modern economy.

212
0:11:48.042,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now, the old economics is correct, of course,

213
0:11:52.75,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that competition plays a crucial role in how markets work,

214
0:11:56.333,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but what it fails to see

215
0:11:58.458,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is that it is largely a competition between highly cooperative groups --

216
0:12:03.167,000 --> 0:12:07,000
competition between firms, competition between networks of firms,

217
0:12:07.958,000 --> 0:12:09,000
competition between nations --

218
0:12:10.667,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and anyone who has ever run a successful business knows

219
0:12:14.583,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that building a cooperative team by including the talents of everyone

220
0:12:19.792,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is almost always a better strategy than just a bunch of selfish jerks.

221
0:12:25.417,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So how do we leave neoliberalism behind

222
0:12:32.458,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and build a more sustainable, more prosperous

223
0:12:37.042,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and more equitable society?

224
0:12:40.042,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb.

225
0:12:44.042,000 --> 0:12:5,000
First is that successful economies are not jungles, they're gardens,

226
0:12:51.667,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is to say that markets,

227
0:12:55.375,000 --> 0:12:57,000
like gardens, must be tended,

228
0:12:59.208,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that the market is the greatest social technology ever invented

229
0:13:03.958,000 --> 0:13:04,000
for solving human problems,

230
0:13:05.458,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but unconstrained by social norms or democratic regulation,

231
0:13:10.667,000 --> 0:13:13,000
markets inevitably create more problems than they solve.

232
0:13:14.042,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Climate change,

233
0:13:15.333,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the great financial crisis of 2008

234
0:13:17.333,000 --> 0:13:18,000
are two easy examples.

235
0:13:19.5,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The second rule is

236
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that inclusion creates economic growth.

237
0:13:28.208,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So the neoliberal idea

238
0:13:30.792,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that inclusion is this fancy luxury

239
0:13:33.417,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards.

240
0:13:39.208,000 --> 0:13:41,000
The economy is people.

241
0:13:42.667,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Including more people in more ways

242
0:13:44.75,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is what causes economic growth in market economies.

243
0:13:49.875,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The third principle

244
0:13:51.958,000 --> 0:13:57,000
is the purpose of the corporation is not merely to enrich shareholders.

245
0:13:58.167,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The greatest grift in contemporary economic life

246
0:14:01.958,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation

247
0:14:04.958,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and the only responsibility of executives

248
0:14:07.875,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is to enrich themselves and shareholders.

249
0:14:11.958,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The new economics must and can insist

250
0:14:17.417,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that the purpose of the corporation

251
0:14:19.167,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders:

252
0:14:22.083,000 --> 0:14:24,000
customers, workers,

253
0:14:24.333,000 --> 0:14:26,000
community and shareholders alike.

254
0:14:28.208,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Rule four:

255
0:14:30.25,000 --> 0:14:32,000
greed is not good.

256
0:14:34.583,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist,

257
0:14:38.375,000 --> 0:14:4,000
it makes you a sociopath.

258
0:14:40.458,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

259
0:14:42.917,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Applause)

260
0:14:47.042,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours,

261
0:14:52.25,000 --> 0:14:56,000
sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society.

262
0:14:57.375,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And fifth and finally,

263
0:15:00.25,000 --> 0:15:02,000
unlike the laws of physics,

264
0:15:03.833,000 --> 0:15:06,000
the laws of economics are a choice.

265
0:15:08.542,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, neoliberal economic theory

266
0:15:10.25,000 --> 0:15:15,000
has sold itself to you as unchangeable natural law,

267
0:15:15.292,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when in fact it's social norms and constructed narratives

268
0:15:19.208,000 --> 0:15:2,000
based on pseudoscience.

269
0:15:21.917,000 --> 0:15:24,000
If we truly want a more equitable,

270
0:15:25.458,000 --> 0:15:28,000
more prosperous and more sustainable economy,

271
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
if we want high-functioning democracies

272
0:15:31.75,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and civil society,

273
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
we must have a new economics.

274
0:15:36.792,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And here's the good news:

275
0:15:38.792,000 --> 0:15:4,000
if we want a new economics,

276
0:15:40.875,000 --> 0:15:43,000
all we have to do is choose to have it.

277
0:15:44.792,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Thank you.

278
0:15:46.083,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

279
0:16:03.708,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Moderator: So Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot.

280
0:16:08.333,000 --> 0:16:11,000
If you're so unhappy with the economic system,

281
0:16:11.458,000 --> 0:16:15,000
why not just give all your money away and join the 99 percent?

282
0:16:16.208,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right.

283
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:2,000
You get that a lot. You get that a lot.

284
0:16:20.958,000 --> 0:16:22,000
"If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more,

285
0:16:23.708,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and if you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more?"

286
0:16:26.625,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And I could do that.

287
0:16:29.083,000 --> 0:16:3,000
The problem is,

288
0:16:30.625,000 --> 0:16:31,000
it doesn't make that much difference,

289
0:16:32.458,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and I have discovered a strategy

290
0:16:34.042,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that works literally a hundred thousand times better --

291
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Moderator: OK.

292
0:16:38.292,000 --> 0:16:41,000
NH: which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws

293
0:16:41.875,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that will require all the other rich people

294
0:16:43.958,000 --> 0:16:45,000
to pay taxes and pay their workers better.

295
0:16:46.042,000 --> 0:16:47,000
(Applause)

296
0:16:47.875,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And so, for example,

297
0:16:49.25,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the 15-dollar minimum wage that we cooked up

298
0:16:52.625,000 --> 0:16:53,000
has now affected 30 million workers.

299
0:16:54.625,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So that works better.

300
0:16:55.917,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Moderator: That's great.

301
0:16:57.208,000 --> 0:16:59,000
If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you.

302
0:16:59.875,000 --> 0:17:01,000
NH: OK. Thank you. Moderator: Thank you very much.

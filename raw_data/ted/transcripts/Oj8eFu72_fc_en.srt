1
0:00:12.924,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I live in Washington, D.C.,

2
0:00:17.112,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa, in India.

3
0:00:24.479,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My father was a government worker.

4
0:00:28.973,000 --> 0:00:31,000
My mother could not read or write, but she

5
0:00:32.859,000 --> 0:00:37,000
would say to me, "A king is worshipped only in his

6
0:00:38.303,000 --> 0:00:44,000
own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."

7
0:00:44.441,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.

8
0:00:47.895,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But I almost didn't go to college

9
0:00:52.077,000 --> 0:00:56,000
until an aunt offered financial help.

10
0:00:56.609,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I went to study in Sambalpur,

11
0:00:58.794,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the largest town in the region,

12
0:01:02.989,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where, already in college, I saw a television for the first time.

13
0:01:09.988,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I had dreams of going to the United States

14
0:01:12.148,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for higher studies.

15
0:01:14.748,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When the opportunity came,

16
0:01:16.877,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money

17
0:01:19.212,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.

18
0:01:25.905,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In the U.S., I worked in a research center,

19
0:01:30.512,000 --> 0:01:34,000
part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.

20
0:01:34.817,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And with the little I earned, I would

21
0:01:40.151,000 --> 0:01:42,000
finance myself and then I would send

22
0:01:42.458,000 --> 0:01:46,000
money home to my brother and my father.

23
0:01:46.916,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My story is not unique.

24
0:01:50.285,000 --> 0:01:54,000
There are millions of people who migrate each year.

25
0:01:54.559,000 --> 0:01:57,000
With the help of the family, they cross oceans,

26
0:01:58.34,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they cross deserts, they cross rivers, they cross mountains.

27
0:02:05.155,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They risk their lives to realize a dream,

28
0:02:09.483,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that dream is as simple as having a

29
0:02:12.156,000 --> 0:02:15,000
decent job somewhere so they can send money home

30
0:02:15.467,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and help the family,

31
0:02:17.297,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which has helped them before.

32
0:02:21.954,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There are 232 million international migrants in the world.

33
0:02:27.046,000 --> 0:02:28,000
These are people who live in a country

34
0:02:28.395,000 --> 0:02:3,000
other than their country of birth.

35
0:02:31.051,000 --> 0:02:32,000
If there was a country made up of

36
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:33,000
only international migrants,

37
0:02:34.369,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that would be larger, in population,

38
0:02:36.426,000 --> 0:02:37,000
than Brazil.

39
0:02:37.863,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That would be larger, in its size

40
0:02:39.868,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of the economy, than France.

41
0:02:43.07,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,

42
0:02:47.567,000 --> 0:02:5,000
send money home regularly.

43
0:02:50.718,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Those sums of money are called remittances.

44
0:02:55.743,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Here is a fact that might surprise you:

45
0:02:59.73,000 --> 0:03:03,000
413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars

46
0:03:04.453,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was the amount of remittances sent last year

47
0:03:07.486,000 --> 0:03:1,000
by migrants to developing countries.

48
0:03:10.522,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Migrants from developing countries,

49
0:03:11.806,000 --> 0:03:13,000
money sent to developing countries —

50
0:03:13.95,000 --> 0:03:15,000
413 billion dollars.

51
0:03:16.4,000 --> 0:03:17,000
That's a remarkable number because

52
0:03:18.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that is three times the size of

53
0:03:19.985,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the total of development aid money.

54
0:03:23.799,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And yet, you and I,

55
0:03:27.262,000 --> 0:03:28,000
my colleagues in Washington,

56
0:03:28.768,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we endlessly debate and

57
0:03:30.765,000 --> 0:03:32,000
discuss about development aid,

58
0:03:33.193,000 --> 0:03:37,000
while we ignore remittances as small change.

59
0:03:37.482,000 --> 0:03:4,000
True, people send 200 dollars per month,

60
0:03:40.635,000 --> 0:03:44,000
on average. But, repeated month after month,

61
0:03:44.706,000 --> 0:03:46,000
by millions of people,

62
0:03:46.744,000 --> 0:03:5,000
these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency.

63
0:03:50.811,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So India, last year, received 72 billion dollars, larger than

64
0:03:55.905,000 --> 0:03:57,000
its IT exports.

65
0:03:58.361,000 --> 0:04:,000
In Egypt remittances are three times

66
0:04:01.345,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.

67
0:04:04.917,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.

68
0:04:08.729,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And in poorer countries, smaller countries, fragile countries,

69
0:04:11.568,000 --> 0:04:16,000
conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,

70
0:04:16.637,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as in Somalia or in Haiti.

71
0:04:20.013,000 --> 0:04:22,000
No wonder these flows have huge

72
0:04:22.016,000 --> 0:04:26,000
impacts on economies and on poor people.

73
0:04:26.916,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Remittances, unlike private investment money,

74
0:04:30.725,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they don't flow back at the first

75
0:04:33.752,000 --> 0:04:34,000
sign of trouble in the country.

76
0:04:35.543,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They actually act like an insurance.

77
0:04:38.428,000 --> 0:04:4,000
When the family is in trouble,

78
0:04:40.848,000 --> 0:04:42,000
facing hardship, facing hard times,

79
0:04:43.453,000 --> 0:04:45,000
remittances increase, they act like an insurance.

80
0:04:45.52,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Migrants send more money then.

81
0:04:48.079,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Unlike development aid money,

82
0:04:49.674,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that must go through official agencies,

83
0:04:52.251,000 --> 0:04:55,000
through governments, remittances

84
0:04:55.368,000 --> 0:04:56,000
directly reach the poor,

85
0:04:56.993,000 --> 0:04:57,000
reach the family,

86
0:04:58.311,000 --> 0:05:,000
and often with business advice.

87
0:05:00.865,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So in Nepal, the share of poor

88
0:05:04.045,000 --> 0:05:06,000
people was 42 percent in 1995,

89
0:05:06.873,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the share of poor people in the population.

90
0:05:09.06,000 --> 0:05:12,000
By 2005, a decade later, at a

91
0:05:12.662,000 --> 0:05:14,000
time of political crisis, economic crisis,

92
0:05:15.47,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.

93
0:05:19.839,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That decline in poverty, most of it,

94
0:05:23.115,000 --> 0:05:24,000
about half of it, is believed to be

95
0:05:25.014,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because of remittances from India,

96
0:05:27.741,000 --> 0:05:29,000
another poor country.

97
0:05:29.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In El Salvador, the school dropout

98
0:05:34.043,000 --> 0:05:37,000
rate among children is lower

99
0:05:37.281,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in families that receive remittances.

100
0:05:39.087,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In Mexico and Sri Lanka,

101
0:05:41.056,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the birth weight of children is higher

102
0:05:45.455,000 --> 0:05:5,000
among families that receive remittances.

103
0:05:50.869,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.

104
0:05:54.568,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Migrants send money home for food,

105
0:05:57.289,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for buying necessities, for building houses,

106
0:05:59.541,000 --> 0:06:01,000
for funding education, for funding

107
0:06:01.929,000 --> 0:06:03,000
healthcare for the elderly, for business

108
0:06:04.658,000 --> 0:06:06,000
investments for friends and family.

109
0:06:06.916,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Migrants send even more money home

110
0:06:09.255,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for special occasions like a surgery

111
0:06:12.003,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or a wedding. And migrants also send

112
0:06:15.767,000 --> 0:06:17,000
money, perhaps far too many times,

113
0:06:18.707,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for unexpected funerals that

114
0:06:21.103,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they cannot attend.

115
0:06:25.001,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Much as these flows do all that good,

116
0:06:27.679,000 --> 0:06:28,000
there are barriers to these

117
0:06:29.077,000 --> 0:06:3,000
flows of remittances, these

118
0:06:30.987,000 --> 0:06:32,000
400 billion dollars of remittances.

119
0:06:33.509,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Foremost among them is

120
0:06:35.49,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the exorbitant cost of sending money home.

121
0:06:39.796,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Money transfer companies structure

122
0:06:41.793,000 --> 0:06:44,000
their fees to milk the poor.

123
0:06:45.567,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They will say, "Up to 500 dollars

124
0:06:48.569,000 --> 0:06:49,000
if you want to send, we will charge you

125
0:06:50.244,000 --> 0:06:52,000
30 dollars fixed."

126
0:06:52.538,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If you are poor and if you have only 200 dollars to send,

127
0:06:55.634,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you have to pay that $30 fee.

128
0:06:58.876,000 --> 0:07:,000
The global average cost of sending

129
0:07:00.911,000 --> 0:07:02,000
money is eight percent.

130
0:07:03.448,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That means you send 100 dollars,

131
0:07:04.999,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the family on the other side receives only

132
0:07:06.672,000 --> 0:07:07,000
92 dollars.

133
0:07:08.229,000 --> 0:07:09,000
To send money to Africa,

134
0:07:10.013,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the cost is even higher:

135
0:07:11.596,000 --> 0:07:12,000
12 percent.

136
0:07:12.942,000 --> 0:07:13,000
To send money within Africa,

137
0:07:14.916,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the cost is even higher:

138
0:07:16.4,000 --> 0:07:17,000
over 20 percent.

139
0:07:17.719,000 --> 0:07:2,000
For example, sending money from Benin to Nigeria.

140
0:07:21.588,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,

141
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because of exchange controls,

142
0:07:27.321,000 --> 0:07:29,000
you send 100 dollars and you

143
0:07:29.321,000 --> 0:07:31,000
are lucky if the family on the other side

144
0:07:31.339,000 --> 0:07:34,000
receives even 10 dollars.

145
0:07:34.749,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela

146
0:07:37.693,000 --> 0:07:38,000
through the official channel.

147
0:07:39.316,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It all goes in suitcases.

148
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Whereever costs are high,

149
0:07:43.51,000 --> 0:07:45,000
money goes underground.

150
0:07:45.893,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what is worse,

151
0:07:47.829,000 --> 0:07:49,000
many developing countries actually

152
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
have a blanket ban on sending money

153
0:07:52.407,000 --> 0:07:53,000
out of the country.

154
0:07:54.11,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Many rich nations also have a

155
0:07:56.247,000 --> 0:08:01,000
blanket ban on sending money to specific countries.

156
0:08:01.743,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, is it that there are no options,

157
0:08:03.854,000 --> 0:08:05,000
no better options, cheaper options, to send money?

158
0:08:06.487,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There are.

159
0:08:07.278,000 --> 0:08:1,000
M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money

160
0:08:10.998,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and receive money at a fixed cost of only

161
0:08:13.639,000 --> 0:08:15,000
60 cents per transaction.

162
0:08:16.536,000 --> 0:08:18,000
U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico

163
0:08:19.402,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to enable money service businesses

164
0:08:21.041,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to send money to Mexico

165
0:08:22.619,000 --> 0:08:27,000
for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.

166
0:08:27.852,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options

167
0:08:30.807,000 --> 0:08:32,000
can't be applied internationally

168
0:08:33.794,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because of the fear of money laundering,

169
0:08:36.635,000 --> 0:08:38,000
even though there is little data

170
0:08:39.486,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to support any connection, any significant

171
0:08:42.211,000 --> 0:08:43,000
connection between money laundering

172
0:08:43.883,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and these small remittance transactions.

173
0:08:49.273,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Many international banks now

174
0:08:50.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are wary of hosting bank accounts

175
0:08:53.589,000 --> 0:08:56,000
of money service businesses, especially

176
0:08:56.99,000 --> 0:08:58,000
those serving Somalia.

177
0:08:59.65,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Somalia, a country where the

178
0:09:02.347,000 --> 0:09:09,000
per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.

179
0:09:09.491,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia

180
0:09:11.907,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is larger than that amount.

181
0:09:14.219,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.

182
0:09:16.853,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And yet, this is an example of

183
0:09:20.574,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the right hand giving a lot of aid,

184
0:09:22.445,000 --> 0:09:26,000
while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood

185
0:09:26.463,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to that economy, through regulations.

186
0:09:32.064,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Then there is the case of poor people from villages, like me.

187
0:09:36.972,000 --> 0:09:38,000
In the villages, the only place where you can

188
0:09:38.988,000 --> 0:09:4,000
get money is through the post office.

189
0:09:41.72,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Most of the governments in the world

190
0:09:43.713,000 --> 0:09:46,000
have allowed their post offices to have

191
0:09:46.729,000 --> 0:09:49,000
exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.

192
0:09:49.965,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So, if I have to send money to my

193
0:09:52.787,000 --> 0:09:54,000
father in the village, I must send money

194
0:09:55.47,000 --> 0:09:57,000
through that particular money transfer company,

195
0:09:57.773,000 --> 0:09:58,000
even if the cost is high.

196
0:09:59.013,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I cannot go to a cheaper option.

197
0:10:03.325,000 --> 0:10:05,000
This has to go.

198
0:10:05.334,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So, what can international organizations and

199
0:10:07.585,000 --> 0:10:09,000
social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost

200
0:10:09.602,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of sending money home?

201
0:10:11.231,000 --> 0:10:17,000
First, relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars.

202
0:10:17.539,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Governments should recognize that

203
0:10:19.961,000 --> 0:10:23,000
small remittances are not money laundering.

204
0:10:24.208,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships

205
0:10:28.647,000 --> 0:10:3,000
between their post office and the money transfer company.

206
0:10:31.641,000 --> 0:10:32,000
For that matter, between the post office

207
0:10:33.23,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and any national banking system that

208
0:10:35.257,000 --> 0:10:38,000
has a large network that serves the poor.

209
0:10:38.337,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In fact, they should promote competition,

210
0:10:41.621,000 --> 0:10:44,000
open up the partnership so that

211
0:10:44.65,000 --> 0:10:47,000
we will bring down costs like we did,

212
0:10:47.799,000 --> 0:10:5,000
like they did, in the telecommunications industry.

213
0:10:51.275,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You have seen what has happened there.

214
0:10:54.272,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations

215
0:10:59.075,000 --> 0:11:01,000
should create a remittance platform

216
0:11:01.285,000 --> 0:11:02,000
on a nonprofit basis.

217
0:11:02.868,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They should create a nonprofit

218
0:11:03.94,000 --> 0:11:05,000
remittance platform to serve the money transfer

219
0:11:06.14,000 --> 0:11:09,000
companies so that they can send money at a low cost,

220
0:11:09.869,000 --> 0:11:11,000
while complying with all the complex

221
0:11:12.02,000 --> 0:11:16,000
regulations all over the world.

222
0:11:16.732,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The development community should

223
0:11:18.134,000 --> 0:11:2,000
set a goal of reducing remittance costs

224
0:11:20.411,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to one percent from the current eight percent.

225
0:11:23.664,000 --> 0:11:25,000
If we reduce costs to one percent,

226
0:11:25.924,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that would release a saving of 30 billion dollars per year.

227
0:11:30.193,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Thirty billion dollars, that's larger than the entire

228
0:11:34.594,000 --> 0:11:37,000
bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.

229
0:11:37.743,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That is larger than, or almost similar to,

230
0:11:40.759,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the total aid budget of the United States government,

231
0:11:43.928,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the largest donor on the planet.

232
0:11:46.784,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Actually, the savings would be larger

233
0:11:48.409,000 --> 0:11:5,000
than that 30 billion because remittance channels

234
0:11:50.532,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.

235
0:11:55.939,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Another major impediment to the

236
0:11:58.41,000 --> 0:12:,000
flow of remittances reaching the family

237
0:12:00.664,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is the large and exorbitant

238
0:12:03.229,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and illegal cost of recruitment,

239
0:12:06.207,000 --> 0:12:08,000
fees that migrants pay, migrant workers

240
0:12:09.145,000 --> 0:12:12,000
pay to laborers who found them the job.

241
0:12:12.409,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I was in Dubai a few years ago.

242
0:12:16.015,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I visited a camp for workers.

243
0:12:18.29,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.

244
0:12:23.603,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Workers were coming back from

245
0:12:25.415,000 --> 0:12:27,000
their grueling day of work,

246
0:12:27.886,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and I struck a conversation

247
0:12:29.67,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with a Bangladeshi construction worker.

248
0:12:32.53,000 --> 0:12:34,000
He was preoccupied that he is sending

249
0:12:35.439,000 --> 0:12:36,000
money home, he has been

250
0:12:36.956,000 --> 0:12:38,000
sending money home for a few months now,

251
0:12:39.866,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the money is mostly going

252
0:12:41.369,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent

253
0:12:44.021,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who found him that job.

254
0:12:45.664,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And in my mind, I could picture

255
0:12:49.408,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the wife waiting for

256
0:12:50.589,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the monthly remittance.

257
0:12:52.315,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The remittance arrives.

258
0:12:54.08,000 --> 0:12:55,000
She takes the money and hands

259
0:12:55.809,000 --> 0:12:58,000
it over to the recruitment agent,

260
0:12:59.379,000 --> 0:13:01,000
while the children are looking on.

261
0:13:02.375,000 --> 0:13:05,000
This has to stop.

262
0:13:05.705,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It is not only construction workers from Bangladesh,

263
0:13:10.521,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant

264
0:13:12.227,000 --> 0:13:14,000
workers who suffer from this problem.

265
0:13:15.178,000 --> 0:13:16,000
A construction worker from Bangladesh,

266
0:13:16.855,000 --> 0:13:19,000
on an average, pays about 4,000 dollars in recruitment fees

267
0:13:20.65,000 --> 0:13:25,000
for a job that gives him only 2,000 dollars per year in income.

268
0:13:26.029,000 --> 0:13:28,000
That means that for the two years or three years

269
0:13:28.759,000 --> 0:13:31,000
of his life, he is basically sending money

270
0:13:32.252,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to pay for the recruitment fees.

271
0:13:33.536,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The family doesn't get to see any of it.

272
0:13:37.049,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It is not only Dubai, it is the dark

273
0:13:40.82,000 --> 0:13:42,000
underbelly of every major city in the world.

274
0:13:43.394,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,

275
0:13:45.892,000 --> 0:13:47,000
it is workers from all over the world.

276
0:13:48.047,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It is not only men.

277
0:13:49.985,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Women are especially vulnerable to

278
0:13:51.87,000 --> 0:13:54,000
recruitment malpractices.

279
0:13:55.408,000 --> 0:13:59,000
One of the most exciting and newest

280
0:14:00.002,000 --> 0:14:02,000
thing happening in the area of remittances

281
0:14:02.42,000 --> 0:14:05,000
is how to mobilize, through innovation,

282
0:14:05.461,000 --> 0:14:08,000
diaspora saving and diaspora giving.

283
0:14:08.652,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Migrants send money home,

284
0:14:10.535,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but they also save a large amount of

285
0:14:12.168,000 --> 0:14:14,000
money where they live.

286
0:14:14.613,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Annually, migrant savings are estimated

287
0:14:17.248,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to be 500 billion dollars.

288
0:14:21.349,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Most of that money is parked in

289
0:14:23.577,000 --> 0:14:26,000
bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.

290
0:14:27.302,000 --> 0:14:3,000
If a country were to come and offer a three percent

291
0:14:30.394,000 --> 0:14:32,000
or four percent interest rate, and then say

292
0:14:32.905,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that the money would be used for building schools,

293
0:14:35.709,000 --> 0:14:38,000
roads, airports, train systems

294
0:14:38.844,000 --> 0:14:39,000
in the country of origin, a lot

295
0:14:40.656,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of migrants would be interested in

296
0:14:42.593,000 --> 0:14:44,000
parting with their money because

297
0:14:44.983,000 --> 0:14:45,000
it's not only financial gains that

298
0:14:46.778,000 --> 0:14:47,000
give them an opportunity

299
0:14:48.067,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to stay engaged with their country's development.

300
0:14:53.539,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Remittance channels can be used

301
0:14:55.48,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to sell these bonds to migrants

302
0:15:00.051,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because when they come

303
0:15:01.402,000 --> 0:15:02,000
on a monthly basis to send remittances,

304
0:15:02.985,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that's when you can actually sell it to them.

305
0:15:05.566,000 --> 0:15:05,000
You can also do the same

306
0:15:06.539,000 --> 0:15:08,000
for mobilizing diaspora giving.

307
0:15:09.32,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I would love to invest in a

308
0:15:12.158,000 --> 0:15:14,000
bullet train system in India

309
0:15:14.538,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and I would love to contribute to efforts

310
0:15:17.44,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to fight malaria in my village.

311
0:15:21.356,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Remittances are a great way of

312
0:15:25.345,000 --> 0:15:28,000
sharing prosperity between places

313
0:15:29.116,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in a targeted way that benefits

314
0:15:31.412,000 --> 0:15:33,000
those who need them most.

315
0:15:34.348,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Remittances empower people.

316
0:15:37.506,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We must do all we can to make remittances

317
0:15:40.614,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and recruitment

318
0:15:41.599,000 --> 0:15:43,000
safer and cheaper.

319
0:15:43.751,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And it can be done.

320
0:15:46.862,000 --> 0:15:48,000
As for myself, I have been

321
0:15:48.962,000 --> 0:15:52,000
away from India for two decades now.

322
0:15:52.982,000 --> 0:15:54,000
My wife is a Venezuelan.

323
0:15:55.015,000 --> 0:15:58,000
My children are Americans.

324
0:15:58.913,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.

325
0:16:02.86,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And yet, I am growing nostalgic

326
0:16:05.19,000 --> 0:16:07,000
about my country of birth.

327
0:16:08.142,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.

328
0:16:13.338,000 --> 0:16:15,000
My parents are not there anymore.

329
0:16:15.561,000 --> 0:16:18,000
My brothers and sisters have moved on.

330
0:16:19.063,000 --> 0:16:21,000
There is no real urgency for me to send money home.

331
0:16:21.597,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And yet, from time to time,

332
0:16:24.219,000 --> 0:16:26,000
I send money home to friends,

333
0:16:27.07,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to relatives, to the village,

334
0:16:29.911,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to be there, to stay engaged —

335
0:16:32.147,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that's part of my identity.

336
0:16:34.195,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And, I'm still striving to be a poet

337
0:16:37.435,000 --> 0:16:39,000
for the hardworking migrants

338
0:16:39.803,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and their struggle to break free

339
0:16:41.34,000 --> 0:16:42,000
of the cycle of poverty.

340
0:16:42.628,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thank you.

341
0:16:44.402,000 --> 0:16:5,000

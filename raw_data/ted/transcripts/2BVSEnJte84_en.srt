2
0:00:13.45,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to begin today with a story

3
0:00:15.474,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and end with a revolution.

4
0:00:17.499,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:18.858,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Are you ready?

6
0:00:20.048,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Audience: Yes!

7
0:00:21.233,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.

8
0:00:23.162,000 --> 0:00:24,000
All my life I wanted to be an actress.

9
0:00:25.168,000 --> 0:00:28,000
From the time I was very small, I could feel the magic of storytelling

10
0:00:28.644,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I wanted to be a part of it.

11
0:00:30.668,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So, at the ripe age of 21,

12
0:00:32.424,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts

13
0:00:35.05,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in New York City,

14
0:00:36.236,000 --> 0:00:39,000
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and ready to take my rightful place

15
0:00:39.428,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as the next Meryl Streep.

16
0:00:41.662,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

17
0:00:43.635,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:44.667,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, it's important for this story that you understand

19
0:00:47.348,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that I was raised by a raging feminist.

20
0:00:49.373,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I mean, just to give you some idea:

21
0:00:51.303,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when I was five or six years old and obsessed with "The Sound of Music,"

22
0:00:54.884,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and running around, singing, "I am 16 going on 17,"

23
0:00:57.336,000 --> 0:00:58,000
all day every day,

24
0:00:58.932,000 --> 0:01:,000
my mother sat me down for a very serious conversation

25
0:01:01.665,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and she said, "OK, look.

26
0:01:03.46,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm not going to say that you can't sing that song,

27
0:01:06.52,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but if you are going to sing that song, I do need you to understand

28
0:01:10.099,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the extremely problematic gender construct that it reinforces."

29
0:01:13.142,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:15.244,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So that's where I come from.

31
0:01:16.917,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So it just honestly never even occurred to me

32
0:01:19.308,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that I would be prevented from doing anything in my life

33
0:01:21.994,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because I'm a woman.

34
0:01:23.378,000 --> 0:01:24,000
OK. So I graduate.

35
0:01:24.553,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I start auditioning and I get work, slowly.

36
0:01:27.351,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But I just start noticing that the parts available for women

37
0:01:30.619,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are terrible.

38
0:01:32.353,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But, remember -- I came here

39
0:01:34.193,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to play smart, willful, complicated, interesting

40
0:01:37.603,000 --> 0:01:4,000
complex, confident female characters, right?

41
0:01:40.668,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Like Meryl.

42
0:01:42.172,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And all of the sudden,

43
0:01:43.604,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I am wrestling with 300 other gorgeous, talented women

44
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to play ...

45
0:01:48.708,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"[Female] No dialogue.

46
0:01:50.732,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The character only needs to stand on a balcony,

47
0:01:53.183,000 --> 0:01:55,000
look forlorn, and walk back inside the house.

48
0:01:55.845,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Only partial nudity."

49
0:01:57.178,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

50
0:01:58.934,000 --> 0:02:,000
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.

51
0:02:00.958,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Attractive, cute, and flirty, she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize

52
0:02:04.992,000 --> 0:02:05,000
throughout the entire film."

53
0:02:07.349,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"[Mom] A proper Southern belle who is making peace with the fact

54
0:02:11.084,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that her only purpose in life is to tend to her husband."

55
0:02:14.788,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"[Abby] Must be OK with a tastefully shot gang rape,

56
0:02:18.297,000 --> 0:02:2,000
along with performing 19th-century dance."

57
0:02:20.955,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:23.168,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Those are actual casting notices.

59
0:02:26.467,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And so I just mentioned this to my agent one day,

60
0:02:28.934,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I say, "I feel like I'm not really going in for parts

61
0:02:31.675,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that I'm actually excited about playing.

62
0:02:34.158,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know what to do with you.

63
0:02:37.497,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You're too smart for the parts

64
0:02:39.02,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that are being written for women in their 20s,

65
0:02:41.224,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and you're not quite pretty enough to be the hot one,

66
0:02:43.863,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so I think you'll work when you're 35."

67
0:02:45.887,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:47.342,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I said, "Oh. That's funny.

69
0:02:48.797,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I always thought that when you were 35, you were kind of, like,

70
0:02:51.834,000 --> 0:02:52,000
over the hill as an actress,

71
0:02:53.225,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that you were relegated to playing 20-year-olds' mothers."

72
0:02:56.025,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And he said, "Yeah --

73
0:02:57.419,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:00.135,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's just the way it is."

75
0:03:02.937,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So, maybe a year or so after this,

76
0:03:05.369,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm having lunch with an actress friend of mine,

77
0:03:07.663,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and we're talking about how insane this is.

78
0:03:09.704,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And we decide, you know what? No problem.

79
0:03:12.233,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We'll just make our own movie.

80
0:03:13.818,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I'll write and then I'll write it about two complex female characters.

81
0:03:17.716,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So we do.

82
0:03:18.89,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We set out to make this movie,

83
0:03:20.393,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring an all-female production team:

84
0:03:23.903,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the writer, directors, producers,

85
0:03:25.527,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it's a film about two women.

86
0:03:27.111,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so pretty soon, we're sitting in the office

87
0:03:29.379,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of a successful male producer,

88
0:03:30.98,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and he goes, "OK, girls.

89
0:03:33.467,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So, you do understand that at some point you are going to have to hire

90
0:03:36.802,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a male producer onboard, right?

91
0:03:38.721,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Just so that people will trust you with their money."

92
0:03:43.116,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Over and over again, people tell us,

93
0:03:45.318,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"Yeah, but people don't really want to see films about women,

94
0:03:48.325,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so maybe you should think about making something else.

95
0:03:51.044,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's just the way it is."

96
0:03:54.161,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we make the movie, anyway.

97
0:03:55.919,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We scrape together 80,000 dollars,

98
0:03:58.192,000 --> 0:04:,000
and we make it, and it does so well.

99
0:04:00.596,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It gets into tons of festivals and we win a lot of awards

100
0:04:03.889,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it's big and exciting.

101
0:04:06.389,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But these experiences I've had just keep rubbing at me.

102
0:04:09.761,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And so, I just start talking about them,

103
0:04:11.905,000 --> 0:04:13,000
first, at Q and A's after screenings of the film,

104
0:04:14.859,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and then I get invited to be on panels and talk at conferences.

105
0:04:17.955,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And the really amazing thing is that, to begin with,

106
0:04:20.457,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when I'm just talking to audiences

107
0:04:22.207,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and other people, you know, coming up in the film industry,

108
0:04:25.099,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the universal reaction is,

109
0:04:27.123,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Oh my god! This is terrible. What do we do about this?"

110
0:04:30.902,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But the bigger panels I get on,

111
0:04:33.211,000 --> 0:04:35,000
suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,

112
0:04:35.933,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Look, I totally agree with everything you're saying.

113
0:04:38.493,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You just need to be really careful about where you say it."

114
0:04:41.958,000 --> 0:04:42,000
An Oscar-winning producer tells me

115
0:04:43.685,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that she doesn't think it's a good idea to play the woman card.

116
0:04:47.322,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's just the way it is.

117
0:04:50.566,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I think this is how sexism continues on in 2016, right?

118
0:04:54.445,000 --> 0:04:56,000
For the most part, it happens casually --

119
0:04:57.255,000 --> 0:04:58,000
unconsciously, even.

120
0:04:58.952,000 --> 0:05:,000
It happens because people are just trying to get along

121
0:05:01.572,000 --> 0:05:02,000
within an existing system.

122
0:05:03.121,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire

123
0:05:06.467,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to teach a young woman the way that the world "just is."

124
0:05:10.556,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The problem is that unless we do something about it,

125
0:05:13.041,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that is the way the world will always be.

126
0:05:16.628,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So why should you care about this?

127
0:05:18.484,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Right?

128
0:05:19.663,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I mean, we're facing some rather significant problems in the world

129
0:05:22.922,000 --> 0:05:23,000
just at present,

130
0:05:24.098,000 --> 0:05:26,000
what does it really matter if I can't get a job,

131
0:05:26.461,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or you're stuck watching "Transformer 17," right?

132
0:05:28.808,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:30.57,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, let me put it to you this way:

134
0:05:32.911,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the year "Jaws" came out,

135
0:05:34.319,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Americans suddenly started listing "sharks" among their top 10 major fears.

136
0:05:40.01,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise three million dollars

137
0:05:45.72,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to have James Bond switch from driving an Aston Martin

138
0:05:48.637,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to a BMW Z3.

139
0:05:51.122,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That one move caused so many people to go out and buy that car,

140
0:05:55.695,000 --> 0:06:,000
that BMW made 240 million dollars in pre-sales alone.

141
0:06:01.367,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The year that "Brave" and "Hunger Games" came out,

142
0:06:04.036,000 --> 0:06:07,000
female participation in archery went up 105 percent.

143
0:06:07.477,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:10.389,000 --> 0:06:11,000
In fact, studies show

145
0:06:11.757,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that the movies you watch don't just affect your hobbies,

146
0:06:15.488,000 --> 0:06:2,000
they affect your career choices, your emotions, your sense of identity,

147
0:06:20.805,000 --> 0:06:23,000
your relationships, your mental health -- even your marital status.

148
0:06:25.924,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So now, consider this:

149
0:06:28.29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
if you have watched mostly American movies in your lifetime,

150
0:06:33.027,000 --> 0:06:36,000
95 percent of all the films you have ever seen

151
0:06:36.975,000 --> 0:06:37,000
were directed by men.

152
0:06:39.507,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all of the leading characters

153
0:06:43.189,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that you have ever seen

154
0:06:45.358,000 --> 0:06:46,000
were men.

155
0:06:46.802,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And even if we just talk about the last five years,

156
0:06:49.805,000 --> 0:06:53,000
55 percent of the time that you have seen a woman in a movie,

157
0:06:53.902,000 --> 0:06:55,000
she was naked or scantily clad.

158
0:06:57.804,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That affects you.

159
0:06:59.949,000 --> 0:07:,000
That affects all of us.

160
0:07:02.315,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We actually can't even imagine how much it affects us,

161
0:07:05.01,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because this is all we've ever had.

162
0:07:07.881,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Stories -- and movies are just modern stories --

163
0:07:10.571,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are not frivolous.

164
0:07:12.571,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They're actually the mechanism through which we process

165
0:07:15.348,000 --> 0:07:17,000
our experience of being alive.

166
0:07:18.045,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They're the way that we understand the world

167
0:07:20.199,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and our place in it.

168
0:07:21.655,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They're the way we develop empathy

169
0:07:23.451,000 --> 0:07:25,000
for people who have experiences different than our own.

170
0:07:27.06,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And right now, all of that is being funneled at us

171
0:07:30.303,000 --> 0:07:32,000
through the prism of this one perspective.

172
0:07:33.03,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's not that it's a bad perspective,

173
0:07:34.95,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but don't we deserve to hear them all?

174
0:07:37.786,000 --> 0:07:4,000
How would the world be different if all of the stories were told?

175
0:07:41.851,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So what do we do about this?

176
0:07:43.652,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This may be the first time a lot of you are hearing about this,

177
0:07:46.795,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but a lot of us within the film industry have spent years --

178
0:07:50.323,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a lot of people, a lot longer than I have --

179
0:07:52.996,000 --> 0:07:54,000
giving speeches and doing panels and writing articles

180
0:07:55.656,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and doing studies,

181
0:07:56.834,000 --> 0:08:,000
and really just yelling at Hollywood to do a better job about this.

182
0:08:00.927,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I mean, we have really yelled at them.

183
0:08:04.682,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And yet, Paramount and Fox recently released their slates,

184
0:08:08.705,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and of the 47 films that they will release between now and 2018,

185
0:08:13.361,000 --> 0:08:16,000
not a single one will be directed by a woman.

186
0:08:19.708,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So it is beginning to occur to me

187
0:08:21.614,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that waiting for Hollywood to grow a conscience

188
0:08:24.641,000 --> 0:08:26,000
may not actually be a winning strategy.

189
0:08:27.406,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In fact, it seems to me

190
0:08:28.625,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that whenever there is a small, ruling class of people

191
0:08:31.532,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who have all of the money and power and resources,

192
0:08:34.452,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they're not actually that excited about giving it up.

193
0:08:37.901,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And so you don't get change by asking them

194
0:08:40.677,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or even yelling at them.

195
0:08:42.869,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You have to make that change happen

196
0:08:45.504,000 --> 0:08:46,000
through a revolution.

197
0:08:47.761,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, please don't worry -- I promise you, here, now, today,

198
0:08:52.293,000 --> 0:08:54,000
our body count will be very low.

199
0:08:54.317,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

200
0:08:56.57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So, now before I get to my four-point plan for the revolution --

201
0:09:00.247,000 --> 0:09:01,000
yes, I have a four-point plan --

202
0:09:01.912,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I have two pieces of very good and important news for you.

203
0:09:04.753,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Good news number one:

204
0:09:06.008,000 --> 0:09:08,000
there are female filmmakers.

205
0:09:08.365,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Cheers and applause)

206
0:09:09.642,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Yes! I know!

207
0:09:11.093,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:12.274,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We exist!

209
0:09:14.455,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We actually graduate from film schools

210
0:09:16.582,000 --> 0:09:18,000
at the same rate that men do -- 50 percent.

211
0:09:18.929,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So here we have our 50 women.

212
0:09:21.251,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The problem is that as soon as you get to the micro-budget film,

213
0:09:24.462,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so even the very smallest films,

214
0:09:26.047,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we're already only directing 18 percent.

215
0:09:29.331,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Then you get to slightly bigger films,

216
0:09:31.355,000 --> 0:09:34,000
indies in the $1-5 million budget range,

217
0:09:34.51,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and we go down to 12 percent.

218
0:09:36.141,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So by the time you get to the studio system,

219
0:09:38.668,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we're only directing five percent of movies.

220
0:09:41.755,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, I know some of you out there will look at this

221
0:09:45.075,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and secretly think to yourselves,

222
0:09:46.982,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Well, maybe women just aren't as good at directing movies."

223
0:09:50.567,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And that's not a totally insane question.

224
0:09:52.766,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I mean, we like to believe the film industry is a meritocracy, right?

225
0:09:56.147,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughs)

226
0:09:57.456,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

227
0:09:59.527,000 --> 0:10:,000
But look at this trajectory.

228
0:10:01.299,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Either you have to accept

229
0:10:02.686,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that women are actually five percent as talented as men,

230
0:10:06.961,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which I don't,

231
0:10:08.143,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or you have to accept that there are serious systemic issues

232
0:10:11.187,000 --> 0:10:13,000
preventing us from getting from here to there.

233
0:10:14.024,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But the good news is, we exist,

234
0:10:16.463,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and there is a vast amount of untapped potential over here.

235
0:10:20.802,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Good news number two, and this is really good news:

236
0:10:25.411,000 --> 0:10:28,000
films by and about women make more money.

237
0:10:29.369,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Yes! Yes! It's true!

238
0:10:32.517,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Cheers and applause)

239
0:10:33.877,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's true.

240
0:10:35.545,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The Washington Post recently released a study

241
0:10:37.888,000 --> 0:10:41,000
showing that films that feature women make 23 cents more on every dollar

242
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:43,000
than films that don't.

243
0:10:44.506,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Furthermore, my colleagues and I commissioned a study

244
0:10:47.094,000 --> 0:10:5,000
comparing 1,700 films made over the last five years

245
0:10:50.254,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and, looking at the average returns on investment --

246
0:10:52.827,000 --> 0:10:54,000
so, how much money does that movie make --

247
0:10:54.874,000 --> 0:10:57,000
comparing if a man or a woman filled each of the following roles:

248
0:10:58.248,000 --> 0:11:01,000
director, producer, screenwriter and lead actor.

249
0:11:01.884,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And in every single category,

250
0:11:04.585,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the return on investment is higher if it's a woman.

251
0:11:08.797,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Fact: women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets.

252
0:11:13.361,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Films by and about women make more money.

253
0:11:15.927,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And of course, at least some portion of the male population

254
0:11:18.893,000 --> 0:11:19,000
does also like women --

255
0:11:20.132,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:23.281,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so "women films" are not just for women.

257
0:11:26.75,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And yet, Hollywood only targets 18 percent of all of their films

258
0:11:30.892,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as "women films."

259
0:11:32.598,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So what you're left with is a giant underserved audience

260
0:11:36.692,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and untapped profit potential.

261
0:11:40.937,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.

262
0:11:43.921,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We have so many stories to tell.

263
0:11:46.754,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And despite everything we've heard: you want to see them.

264
0:11:51.044,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The problem is, we've got this thing -- let's call it "Hollywood" --

265
0:11:55.127,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Laughter)

266
0:11:57.457,000 --> 0:11:58,000
no, no, I'm just kidding;

267
0:11:58.699,000 --> 0:12:,000
I've met some very nice people in Hollywood --

268
0:12:01.03,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Hollywood, preventing us from getting to you.

269
0:12:04.064,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So here is my four-point plan for the revolution,

270
0:12:06.376,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and everybody -- man or woman, in this room or anywhere in the world --

271
0:12:09.77,000 --> 0:12:1,000
is going to get to help.

272
0:12:11.003,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And this revolution is not just for women.

273
0:12:13.643,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Anyone who has been disenfranchised,

274
0:12:15.849,000 --> 0:12:17,000
anyone whose story has not been told,

275
0:12:18.784,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the same principles apply,

276
0:12:20.088,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I really hope we can do the revolution together.

277
0:12:24.392,000 --> 0:12:25,000
My four-point plan.

278
0:12:26.371,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Number one: watch movies.

279
0:12:28.991,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Isn't this a good revolution?

280
0:12:30.499,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

281
0:12:31.593,000 --> 0:12:33,000
OK, first I want to talk to anyone who watches movies.

282
0:12:34.176,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Who watches movies in here?

283
0:12:35.834,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Great!

284
0:12:37.009,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Will you pledge to watch one film by a female filmmaker per month?

285
0:12:41.038,000 --> 0:12:43,000
That's it, just start there. Great!

286
0:12:43.133,000 --> 0:12:44,000
If you need help finding them,

287
0:12:44.723,000 --> 0:12:46,000
you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com

288
0:12:48.009,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's an easily searchable database of films by women.

289
0:12:52.783,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And as you start watching all movies,

290
0:12:55.139,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I just want you to pay attention to the female characters.

291
0:12:58.011,000 --> 0:12:59,000
How many of them are there?

292
0:12:59.332,000 --> 0:13:,000
What are they wearing?

293
0:13:00.545,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Or not?

294
0:13:02.024,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Do they get to do cool things,

295
0:13:03.5,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or are they just there to emotionally support the men?

296
0:13:07.213,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I'm telling you, once you see this, you're not going to be able to unsee it.

297
0:13:10.928,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And as you start noticing this, it's going to shift your viewing habits.

298
0:13:14.534,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And this already sizable market is going to continue to grow.

299
0:13:18.455,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Step two: make movies.

300
0:13:21.361,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So now I'm talking to all the female filmmakers out there:

301
0:13:24.861,000 --> 0:13:26,000
we need you to be very brave.

302
0:13:27.741,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It will be harder for you to make movies.

303
0:13:30.614,000 --> 0:13:33,000
In fact, there will be an entire industry constantly telling you

304
0:13:34.011,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that your stories don't matter.

305
0:13:36.28,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And we need you to make them, anyway.

306
0:13:38.724,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That 18 percent in the micro-budget range -- that is on us to fix.

307
0:13:43.134,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Don't wait for permission.

308
0:13:45.158,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Don't wait for somebody to pick you,

309
0:13:47.182,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because 95 percent says they are not going to.

310
0:13:50.269,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Crowd fund.

311
0:13:51.448,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Write letters to eccentric relatives.

312
0:13:53.35,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I know how hard it is,

313
0:13:54.74,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but you have to make your movies -- now, today, features, not shorts.

314
0:13:59.452,000 --> 0:14:02,000
There is an audience for them, and they want and need to see them.

315
0:14:04.321,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Three: invest in each other.

316
0:14:07.89,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like we need to stop wasting so much energy

317
0:14:11.882,000 --> 0:14:13,000
on a system that does not want us.

318
0:14:13.969,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We need to find our audience and invest in cultivating them.

319
0:14:17.599,000 --> 0:14:19,000
If we can figure out how to make our movies

320
0:14:19.856,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and deliver them to the audiences that want them,

321
0:14:22.364,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that's it.

322
0:14:23.548,000 --> 0:14:24,000
That's the whole game.

323
0:14:24.937,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And whatever they're doing in the middle

324
0:14:26.927,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is going to cease to be quite so important.

325
0:14:29.222,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Audiences, invest in us.

326
0:14:32.293,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Help us make the movies that you want to see.

327
0:14:35.255,000 --> 0:14:38,000
If you can give a female filmmaker 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,

328
0:14:39.218,000 --> 0:14:4,000
great, do that.

329
0:14:40.518,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you can invest more seriously

330
0:14:42.139,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and help us over that critical million-dollar hurdle,

331
0:14:44.677,000 --> 0:14:45,000
do that.

332
0:14:45.868,000 --> 0:14:47,000
But invest in seeing the other half of the story.

333
0:14:50.575,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Four: disrupt through business.

334
0:14:53.352,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So now I'm talking to all of the businesspeople

335
0:14:55.817,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and entrepreneurs.

336
0:14:57.149,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This does not happen very often in the world,

337
0:14:59.587,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but right here we have a golden situation

338
0:15:02.207,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in which you can enact significant social change

339
0:15:05.052,000 --> 0:15:07,000
while also making money.

340
0:15:08.274,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.

341
0:15:11.218,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The old models of financing and distribution are crumbling --

342
0:15:14.216,000 --> 0:15:16,000
please come in and disrupt it.

343
0:15:16.954,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I'll give you an example.

344
0:15:18.618,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Right now, with some incredible women,

345
0:15:20.592,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I am launching the "The 51 Fund."

346
0:15:22.805,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It's a venture capital fund

347
0:15:24.312,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that will finance films written, directed and produced by women

348
0:15:27.663,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in that critical $1-5 million range.

349
0:15:31.057,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We will give a significant number of female filmmakers

350
0:15:33.78,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the chance to make their movies

351
0:15:35.339,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and we will deliver them to the audiences who want them.

352
0:15:38.098,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Good for equality, good for business.

353
0:15:41.719,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But that's only one example, we need more.

354
0:15:43.909,000 --> 0:15:45,000
There is room for so many more.

355
0:15:46.044,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So I say to you:

356
0:15:47.422,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Hollywood is leaving money on the table.

357
0:15:50.073,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Come pick it up.

358
0:15:52.361,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

359
0:15:56.767,000 --> 0:16:,000
Now, all of this may seem like a lot, but it is actually so doable.

360
0:16:00.821,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Entrenched systems don't change because you ask the people in charge,

361
0:16:04.488,000 --> 0:16:07,000
they change because all of the people who don't have what they want

362
0:16:07.748,000 --> 0:16:09,000
rise up and make that change happen.

363
0:16:10.391,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And don't you want to?

364
0:16:12.52,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I want to see what the other 51 percent of the population has to say.

365
0:16:17.337,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I want to watch movies that teach me about people

366
0:16:19.754,000 --> 0:16:2,000
who are different than I am.

367
0:16:21.68,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I want to see women's bodies on film that aren't perfect.

368
0:16:26.237,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I want to give our little boys the chance

369
0:16:28.524,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to empathize with female characters

370
0:16:30.407,000 --> 0:16:32,000
so that they can become more whole men.

371
0:16:33.381,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And I definitely want to give a little girl

372
0:16:35.534,000 --> 0:16:36,000
who may not have a real-life role model

373
0:16:37.515,000 --> 0:16:38,000
the chance to watch movies

374
0:16:38.899,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving.

375
0:16:42.528,000 --> 0:16:44,000
This is not about making one industry better.

376
0:16:45.724,000 --> 0:16:47,000
This is about making a better world.

377
0:16:48.485,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Will you help?

378
0:16:50.905,000 --> 0:16:51,000
The time for waiting is over.

379
0:16:52.669,000 --> 0:16:54,000
The time for the revolution is now.

380
0:16:54.939,000 --> 0:16:58,000
(Cheers and applause)

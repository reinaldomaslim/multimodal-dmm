1
0:00:12.45,000 --> 0:00:2,000
hi dr. chu hey Whitney how are you thank

2
0:00:18.25,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you for being with us today I'm good

3
0:00:20.74,000 --> 0:00:25,000
thank you so much for having me on you

4
0:00:23.74,000 --> 0:00:27,000
know I I'm store that you're working

5
0:00:26.199,000 --> 0:00:29,000
around the clock these days so it really

6
0:00:28.419,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it means a lot that you took some time

7
0:00:30.119,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to be with us and you know I think I I

8
0:00:34.75,000 --> 0:00:37,000
asked how you are but I would love to

9
0:00:36.4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
hear you know truly like how are our

10
0:00:37.93,000 --> 0:00:44,000
things going how are you making out in

11
0:00:41.59,000 --> 0:00:48,000
these times yeah I mean I personally

12
0:00:45.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
can't complain you know Oregon is not

13
0:00:48.61,000 --> 0:00:52,000
New York right now we've actually taken

14
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a lot of early public health measures

15
0:00:52.69,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and are being pretty successful at

16
0:00:55.39,000 --> 0:01:,000
flattening the curve so certainly I mean

17
0:00:57.91,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we're seeing cases it is a time like no

18
0:01:00.97,000 --> 0:01:05,000
other in healthcare I mean really

19
0:01:02.74,000 --> 0:01:06,000
experienced nothing like this it is you

20
0:01:06.549,000 --> 0:01:08,000
know I'm part of this kind of big

21
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:11,000
community of frontline health care

22
0:01:09.34,000 --> 0:01:13,000
workers and talking to my friends around

23
0:01:11.77,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the country and around the world really

24
0:01:13.6,000 --> 0:01:2,000
who are in the emergency room or or are

25
0:01:18.27,000 --> 0:01:25,000
working in the intensive care units and

26
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it it is an incredibly stressful time as

27
0:01:25.42,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a whole but but here in Oregon we're

28
0:01:28.869,000 --> 0:01:34,000
lucky to still be waiting for the wave

29
0:01:30.7,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to hit us and and you you know mention

30
0:01:34.899,000 --> 0:01:39,000
this at Oregon is not has not been hit

31
0:01:36.729,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as hard as some other states but I guess

32
0:01:40.179,000 --> 0:01:42,000
could you talk a little bit more about

33
0:01:41.229,000 --> 0:01:44,000
what you were saying there with Oregon

34
0:01:43.03,000 --> 0:01:46,000
flattening the curve and tell us a

35
0:01:44.95,000 --> 0:01:47,000
little bit more about what the situation

36
0:01:46.719,000 --> 0:01:53,000
looks like there and then also in your

37
0:01:48.7,000 --> 0:01:55,000
hospital specifically yeah I mean the

38
0:01:54.179,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the first case in the United States of

39
0:01:56.679,000 --> 0:02:,000
course came to Seattle which is just

40
0:01:58.299,000 --> 0:02:03,000
three and a half hours up the road as it

41
0:02:01.209,000 --> 0:02:05,000
happened it came the first case that was

42
0:02:03.369,000 --> 0:02:07,000
detected was someone who works at the

43
0:02:05.649,000 --> 0:02:09,000
school were my that my kids attend which

44
0:02:07.929,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is one block from my house so when it

45
0:02:09.85,000 --> 0:02:13,000
came to Oregon it started feeling real

46
0:02:11.65,000 --> 0:02:15,000
very quickly and then early on we saw

47
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the pattern that we were seeing across

48
0:02:15.79,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the United States I mean the doubling

49
0:02:17.89,000 --> 0:02:2,000
times here were every two and a half to

50
0:02:20.409,000 --> 0:02:22,000
three days

51
0:02:21.34,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and I think between watching what was

52
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:29,000
happening in Seattle where the case has

53
0:02:25.81,000 --> 0:02:31,000
really exploded we we took our

54
0:02:29.83,000 --> 0:02:33,000
stay-at-home order very seriously you

55
0:02:32.5,000 --> 0:02:36,000
know so schools were shut down pretty

56
0:02:34.69,000 --> 0:02:39,000
early on people have really been trying

57
0:02:37.269,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to abide by stay-at-home recommendations

58
0:02:40.54,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and and we we watched that doubling time

59
0:02:43.959,000 --> 0:02:47,000
start to stretch out and the progressed

60
0:02:46.18,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the projections for what our hospitals

61
0:02:48.64,000 --> 0:02:53,000
would see for our needs for bed space

62
0:02:51.519,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for intensive care unit base and for

63
0:02:54.19,000 --> 0:02:58,000
ventilators started going down until

64
0:02:56.61,000 --> 0:03:,000
until you could see that probably we

65
0:02:59.079,000 --> 0:03:02,000
will be within the resources that we

66
0:03:01.39,000 --> 0:03:04,000
have in our state

67
0:03:02.769,000 --> 0:03:06,000
which is wonderful and earlier this week

68
0:03:04.45,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you know Oregon was able to to clench to

69
0:03:07.03,000 --> 0:03:11,000
send 140 ventilators to New York City

70
0:03:09.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
there try to help them meet the need in

71
0:03:11.41,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this time of crisis so it's you know

72
0:03:14.319,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we're still at the stage where it's very

73
0:03:16.299,000 --> 0:03:21,000
very different from state to state I

74
0:03:18.37,000 --> 0:03:23,000
mean the cat is kind of out of the bag

75
0:03:21.549,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in certain states in Washington and in

76
0:03:24.22,000 --> 0:03:28,000
New York but many other states still

77
0:03:26.859,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have the opportunity to change their

78
0:03:28.84,000 --> 0:03:33,000
fate so it's really a day-to-day battle

79
0:03:32.2,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to make sure that we stay in the game

80
0:03:33.97,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and that we we continue to be really

81
0:03:36.22,000 --> 0:03:39,000
vigilant with all of our public health

82
0:03:37.569,000 --> 0:03:42,000
measures or even escalate efforts so

83
0:03:40.03,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that we can get over that hump and get

84
0:03:43.12,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to the other side of this thing I mean

85
0:03:45.7,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and that's it's amazing to hear that

86
0:03:48.25,000 --> 0:03:53,000
things seem to be going really well or

87
0:03:50.019,000 --> 0:03:56,000
going or doing much better and and you

88
0:03:54.19,000 --> 0:03:57,000
know I'm curious I'm talking about those

89
0:03:56.079,000 --> 0:03:58,000
other states that you mentioned that

90
0:03:57.19,000 --> 0:04:,000
maybe aren't faring as well I know

91
0:03:58.78,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you're in touch with a lot of colleagues

92
0:04:00.579,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in other parts of the country you know

93
0:04:02.5,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what are you hearing from folks who are

94
0:04:05.019,000 --> 0:04:1,000
maybe in some of those harder hit areas

95
0:04:08.099,000 --> 0:04:12,000
yeah it's really unlike anything you've

96
0:04:10.84,000 --> 0:04:15,000
seen I mean the thing to understand

97
0:04:13.09,000 --> 0:04:18,000
about emergency care and disaster

98
0:04:16.03,000 --> 0:04:21,000
response systems is this is what we do

99
0:04:18.34,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you know it's not like we run on the

100
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
assumption of of normality you know we

101
0:04:24.43,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we are always planning for the

102
0:04:26.59,000 --> 0:04:31,000
worst-case scenario and so we're we're

103
0:04:29.409,000 --> 0:04:33,000
prepared for disasters but but normal

104
0:04:31.69,000 --> 0:04:35,000
quote-unquote normal disasters are

105
0:04:33.789,000 --> 0:04:37,000
they're so much more contained than this

106
0:04:35.86,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so you know we're ready for earthquakes

107
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
hurricanes other national natural

108
0:04:40.99,000 --> 0:04:46,000
disasters or maybe a single mass

109
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
casualty all these things that have so

110
0:04:47.469,000 --> 0:04:52,000
much more so many more sort of borders

111
0:04:50.89,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to them you know these discrete events

112
0:04:52.659,000 --> 0:04:58,000
maybe they affect a single city or a

113
0:04:54.88,000 --> 0:05:01,000
region or you know you're in a position

114
0:04:59.469,000 --> 0:05:03,000
where other states or regions can can

115
0:05:02.469,000 --> 0:05:07,000
chip in I mean you've seen after some of

116
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:1,000
our largest disasters things like 9/11

117
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
other countries were so willing to sort

118
0:05:10.78,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of lend a hand in terms of our our of

119
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
addressing our aftermath and and this is

120
0:05:17.409,000 --> 0:05:2,000
one of those things where where should

121
0:05:19.75,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the help be coming because we're all

122
0:05:20.95,000 --> 0:05:25,000
dealing with this at the same time and

123
0:05:22.78,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so everybody is either in full in it you

124
0:05:26.5,000 --> 0:05:29,000
know like they are in New York City

125
0:05:27.37,000 --> 0:05:32,000
either they're they're in there just

126
0:05:30.46,000 --> 0:05:34,000
trying to deal with a huge caseload of

127
0:05:33.039,000 --> 0:05:36,000
patients and then very sick patients and

128
0:05:35.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
just scrambling to be really creative

129
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:4,000
around these these limited resources

130
0:05:40.03,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that we have everything from personal

131
0:05:41.68,000 --> 0:05:44,000
protective equipment to the medications

132
0:05:43.09,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and space and ventilators and healthcare

133
0:05:44.86,000 --> 0:05:48,000
workers to just being in full-on

134
0:05:47.289,000 --> 0:05:51,000
preparation mode and that's kind of

135
0:05:49.75,000 --> 0:05:53,000
where we are right now in Oregon because

136
0:05:51.729,000 --> 0:05:56,000
our our peak is expected to hit at the

137
0:05:54.55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
end of April or early May and so we're

138
0:05:57.4,000 --> 0:06:01,000
using that precious time to try to

139
0:05:59.169,000 --> 0:06:05,000
figure out in every eventualities our

140
0:06:02.169,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are we going to to handle this surge so

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
no matter what whether the wave has hit

142
0:06:07.24,000 --> 0:06:11,000
or whether it's about to hit everyone is

143
0:06:09.039,000 --> 0:06:15,000
really working 24/7 around this pandemic

144
0:06:11.82,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you know when I think about

145
0:06:15.159,000 --> 0:06:2,000
emergency workers even before this time

146
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you know I always think about them in

147
0:06:21.099,000 --> 0:06:27,000
general just like a you know sort of

148
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
chaotic frantic space and you know I

149
0:06:27.099,000 --> 0:06:3,000
have mentioned that that may change have

150
0:06:29.409,000 --> 0:06:32,000
changed a little bit in the recent weeks

151
0:06:30.909,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and so could you talk a little bit about

152
0:06:32.529,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what your day-to-day experiences are

153
0:06:35.889,000 --> 0:06:39,000
like now as compared to what they would

154
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
have been like what they were like

155
0:06:40.15,000 --> 0:06:46,000
pre-pandemic yeah totally and again I'll

156
0:06:43.389,000 --> 0:06:48,000
speak to the experiences of health care

157
0:06:46.3,000 --> 0:06:5,000
workers that I'm hearing from everywhere

158
0:06:48.63,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you know rather than just mine

159
0:06:50.5,000 --> 0:06:56,000
individual er but there there's kind of

160
0:06:53.919,000 --> 0:06:58,000
two parts to this one is in normal times

161
0:06:56.889,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we run hospitals pretty lean you know so

162
0:06:59.62,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we don't we don't run it so that you

163
0:07:02.949,000 --> 0:07:07,000
walk into a shift and you're relaxing

164
0:07:04.81,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for half of it you know or or so that we

165
0:07:08.71,000 --> 0:07:12,000
have a bunch of empty beds just in case

166
0:07:10.479,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I mean you run it to be pretty close to

167
0:07:12.82,000 --> 0:07:17,000
maxed out all the time because we really

168
0:07:15.79,000 --> 0:07:19,000
run it for financial efficiency you know

169
0:07:17.949,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so hospitals more and more are very full

170
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we're not expanding hospital wards we're

171
0:07:23.47,000 --> 0:07:28,000
really running them as pretty close to

172
0:07:26.62,000 --> 0:07:3,000
peak and in the emergency department I'm

173
0:07:28.57,000 --> 0:07:33,000
on a regular day let's say a weekend

174
0:07:31.3,000 --> 0:07:36,000
evening shift when when an ER doctor

175
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
walks in or an ER nurse walks in you

176
0:07:37.15,000 --> 0:07:4,000
kind of stop and take this deep breath

177
0:07:38.71,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because you know you're going to be

178
0:07:40.539,000 --> 0:07:45,000
running non-stop basically all-out for

179
0:07:44.229,000 --> 0:07:48,000
your entire shift eight to twelve hours

180
0:07:46.389,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or whatever it is and so in normal

181
0:07:48.91,000 --> 0:07:54,000
circumstances we are I mean you feel

182
0:07:51.34,000 --> 0:07:58,000
pretty close to max capacity and then

183
0:07:55.69,000 --> 0:08:,000
add on to that a pandemic and you kind

184
0:07:59.169,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of think of your worst regular day and

185
0:08:01.27,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and in places where they've already hit

186
0:08:03.4,000 --> 0:08:09,000
search it's twice regular or three times

187
0:08:07.66,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or five times or ten times that and so

188
0:08:10.21,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you went from it never was a relaxing

189
0:08:12.94,000 --> 0:08:16,000
job I mean it was always a stressful job

190
0:08:15.13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where there's only so much one person

191
0:08:17.229,000 --> 0:08:2,000
can do and yet you're doing more than

192
0:08:18.97,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that all the time and just trying to

193
0:08:20.38,000 --> 0:08:25,000
keep people safe - really - really you

194
0:08:23.59,000 --> 0:08:27,000
know some order of magnitude higher than

195
0:08:25.99,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that so places that are hit hard really

196
0:08:28.18,000 --> 0:08:35,000
impossibly busy and then and then on the

197
0:08:31.9,000 --> 0:08:36,000
flip side we are we have really done a

198
0:08:35.56,000 --> 0:08:38,000
lot of work in terms of public messaging

199
0:08:37.539,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and messaging through a health system

200
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that if you are not very sick you should

201
0:08:41.74,000 --> 0:08:45,000
stay away because first of all we need

202
0:08:44.229,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to care for these kovat 19 patients and

203
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
also you don't want to get sick by

204
0:08:48.64,000 --> 0:08:51,000
coming here because this is where the

205
0:08:50.23,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Cova 19 patients are coming so for your

206
0:08:52.48,000 --> 0:08:56,000
own safety and your family's safety

207
0:08:54.01,000 --> 0:08:59,000
please stay away and so people even

208
0:08:57.339,000 --> 0:09:01,000
people with very serious health

209
0:08:59.38,000 --> 0:09:04,000
conditions are are staying away

210
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and our caseload in the emergency room

211
0:09:05.02,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is actually very different and so we're

212
0:09:07.89,000 --> 0:09:1,000
disproportionately seeing patients who

213
0:09:10.42,000 --> 0:09:13,000
have fever

214
0:09:10.93,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you know respiratory illnesses symptoms

215
0:09:13.69,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that are likely cope at 19 but almost

216
0:09:16.69,000 --> 0:09:21,000
everything else has gone away or gone

217
0:09:19.51,000 --> 0:09:23,000
down I think what else has contributed

218
0:09:21.88,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to that is that with all of this social

219
0:09:23.53,000 --> 0:09:27,000
distancing so people are staying at home

220
0:09:25.09,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they're not going to parties or bars or

221
0:09:28.03,000 --> 0:09:32,000
restaurants or places where you might

222
0:09:29.65,000 --> 0:09:33,000
drink a lot and get into trouble

223
0:09:32.08,000 --> 0:09:35,000
afterwards so a lot of that Friday night

224
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Saturday night trauma that we would

225
0:09:35.95,000 --> 0:09:39,000
normally normally see car accidents from

226
0:09:38.17,000 --> 0:09:42,000
drunk driving or just from high traffic

227
0:09:40.75,000 --> 0:09:43,000
conditions I mean all the things that

228
0:09:42.46,000 --> 0:09:46,000
happen when you throw a whole bunch of

229
0:09:43.99,000 --> 0:09:49,000
humans together in close quarters though

230
0:09:47.29,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that is kind of our bread and butter in

231
0:09:50.47,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the emergency room and we're not seeing

232
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that whole chunk as much the puzzling

233
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:58,000
thing is actually why we're not seeing

234
0:09:57.25,000 --> 0:10:02,000
things that have no relationship to Cove

235
0:09:59.62,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in nineteen imeem heart attacks strokes

236
0:10:02.35,000 --> 0:10:06,000
those diseases have not gotten any

237
0:10:04.42,000 --> 0:10:08,000
notice that they should wait until kovat

238
0:10:06.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is over you know and so where are those

239
0:10:09.4,000 --> 0:10:12,000
diseases I mean there was an op-ed in

240
0:10:11.41,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The New York Times the other day

241
0:10:12.43,000 --> 0:10:15,000
wondering if people who have very

242
0:10:14.23,000 --> 0:10:19,000
legitimate reasons to come into the

243
0:10:16.42,000 --> 0:10:21,000
hospitals are also avoiding avoiding the

244
0:10:19.78,000 --> 0:10:22,000
house but not that other things aren't

245
0:10:21.46,000 --> 0:10:24,000
legitimate but you know things that that

246
0:10:23.11,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are true emergencies that we should be

247
0:10:24.88,000 --> 0:10:29,000
seen immediately otherwise can lead the

248
0:10:27.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
very poor outcomes or even death in a

249
0:10:30.01,000 --> 0:10:34,000
short period of time what you know what

250
0:10:32.65,000 --> 0:10:36,000
kind of collateral damage are we seeing

251
0:10:34.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because people are afraid to come in so

252
0:10:36.91,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but all of that adds up to a very

253
0:10:38.83,000 --> 0:10:42,000
strange environment in the hospital

254
0:10:40.57,000 --> 0:10:44,000
right now yeah I mean and that's and

255
0:10:43.15,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that's so interesting to hear it sounds

256
0:10:44.71,000 --> 0:10:47,000
like in some ways people are being

257
0:10:46.09,000 --> 0:10:49,000
really more thoughtful about how when

258
0:10:48.49,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they actually do need to seek out care

259
0:10:49.99,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and when they can handle something

260
0:10:51.19,000 --> 0:10:55,000
themselves and I and I imagine it

261
0:10:53.47,000 --> 0:10:57,000
probably remains to be seen whether

262
0:10:55.45,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that's better that people are dealing

263
0:10:57.73,000 --> 0:11:01,000
with some things on their own at home or

264
0:10:59.47,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or whether that's worse what is your

265
0:11:01.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
take on that probably a mix of both I

266
0:11:05.65,000 --> 0:11:09,000
mean I think the truth is right in the

267
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
middle I think when we go back to normal

268
0:11:10.11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it's hard to imagine a time they'll come

269
0:11:12.85,000 --> 0:11:14,000
back to normal but probably when we go

270
0:11:15.04,000 --> 0:11:19,000
back to nor

271
0:11:15.68,000 --> 0:11:2,000
we'll see some things we've learned can

272
0:11:19.19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
stay out of the emergency room or you

273
0:11:20.93,000 --> 0:11:23,000
know I think we're being very creative

274
0:11:22.55,000 --> 0:11:26,000
about telehealth right now and I'm

275
0:11:24.529,000 --> 0:11:28,000
getting people to get health care

276
0:11:26.899,000 --> 0:11:29,000
through their computers or their phones

277
0:11:28.76,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and I think we'll probably find that

278
0:11:30.89,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that that we continue to have expanded

279
0:11:34.279,000 --> 0:11:38,000
use of telemedicine after this because

280
0:11:35.93,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it worked so well I bet people actually

281
0:11:38.42,000 --> 0:11:42,000
be very happy and surprised by the

282
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
number of things that you can do at home

283
0:11:43.22,000 --> 0:11:47,000
for some common health conditions but I

284
0:11:45.89,000 --> 0:11:49,000
also think that when the surge is over

285
0:11:48.08,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for every state we will get an influx of

286
0:11:50.6,000 --> 0:11:55,000
those delayed care cases that will kind

287
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:58,000
of be the second surge of stress on the

288
0:11:56.149,000 --> 0:12:,000
healthcare system not directly rated

289
0:11:58.7,000 --> 0:12:01,000
related to code 19 but what we're kind

290
0:12:01.07,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of calling the collateral damage I'm

291
0:12:02.57,000 --> 0:12:06,000
deferred health problems that really

292
0:12:04.94,000 --> 0:12:08,000
could have benefited from an earlier

293
0:12:07.13,000 --> 0:12:1,000
visit to the hospital emergency room or

294
0:12:09.17,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and in-person visit to your doc to your

295
0:12:10.85,000 --> 0:12:16,000
doctor or nurse practitioner or whoever

296
0:12:14.5,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and you know as the months have gone on

297
0:12:17.39,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and you know we've been dealing with

298
0:12:19.97,000 --> 0:12:23,000
this as a country as a world you know

299
0:12:22.04,000 --> 0:12:26,000
for these past few months in emergency

300
0:12:24.38,000 --> 0:12:29,000
rooms in your emergency room how have

301
0:12:26.39,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you seen the situation change or worsen

302
0:12:29.45,000 --> 0:12:32,000
you know how are things different now

303
0:12:31.1,000 --> 0:12:37,000
than they were say back in early

304
0:12:33.29,000 --> 0:12:39,000
February I mean now we are in it I mean

305
0:12:37.55,000 --> 0:12:43,000
all of us to some extent I mean it's hit

306
0:12:39.98,000 --> 0:12:46,000
all 50 states and so it went from this

307
0:12:43.73,000 --> 0:12:51,000
anticipation to really needing to make

308
0:12:47.27,000 --> 0:12:53,000
those hard decisions and I mean this is

309
0:12:51.77,000 --> 0:12:55,000
so challenging always but in this

310
0:12:53.51,000 --> 0:12:58,000
disease we're not familiar with it and

311
0:12:55.79,000 --> 0:13:,000
so we are learning on the fly so we're

312
0:12:58.94,000 --> 0:13:02,000
learning from China from Italy from

313
0:13:00.95,000 --> 0:13:05,000
South Korea and then from our own early

314
0:13:03.17,000 --> 0:13:09,000
States but that decision making changes

315
0:13:06.17,000 --> 0:13:11,000
so fast that that really there are some

316
0:13:09.23,000 --> 0:13:13,000
days where I feel like the hospital I

317
0:13:11.48,000 --> 0:13:14,000
walk out of at the end of my shift is

318
0:13:13.579,000 --> 0:13:16,000
different than the hospital I walk into

319
0:13:14.959,000 --> 0:13:17,000
at the beginning of my shift and I'm

320
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
hearing this from colleagues all over

321
0:13:18.14,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the place it's not just at my

322
0:13:19.279,000 --> 0:13:24,000
institution where people are sitting you

323
0:13:22.97,000 --> 0:13:26,000
know we've created these these COBIT

324
0:13:24.529,000 --> 0:13:28,000
emergency task force or committees that

325
0:13:27.529,000 --> 0:13:28,000
make decisions for for every health

326
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
system

327
0:13:29.45,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and people are sitting and receiving

328
0:13:32.18,000 --> 0:13:37,000
data as it rolls in and then using that

329
0:13:34.94,000 --> 0:13:39,000
data to enrich the response in their own

330
0:13:37.22,000 --> 0:13:42,000
institution so whether it's I'm trying

331
0:13:40.76,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to think of a good example like even

332
0:13:42.32,000 --> 0:13:47,000
just what we decide to do around brown

333
0:13:44.6,000 --> 0:13:48,000
face masks or around how we manage

334
0:13:47.42,000 --> 0:13:52,000
certain types of patients what

335
0:13:48.74,000 --> 0:13:54,000
medications were looking at as potential

336
0:13:52.49,000 --> 0:13:58,000
therapies I mean this is how wild and

337
0:13:55.25,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and quick it is a few weeks ago earlier

338
0:13:59.06,000 --> 0:14:03,000
in this pandemic we were concerned about

339
0:14:02.15,000 --> 0:14:05,000
a certain class of blood pressure

340
0:14:03.8,000 --> 0:14:08,000
medication called AR B's angiotensin

341
0:14:06.14,000 --> 0:14:1,000
receptor blockers and the rumor was that

342
0:14:09.17,000 --> 0:14:12,000
these were harmful that these would

343
0:14:10.49,000 --> 0:14:12,000
actually lead to more severe disease and

344
0:14:12.41,000 --> 0:14:14,000
there was a question about whether we

345
0:14:13.43,000 --> 0:14:16,000
should be taking patients off of those

346
0:14:14.81,000 --> 0:14:19,000
medications who are using them for blood

347
0:14:17.42,000 --> 0:14:22,000
pressure control 3 weeks later that

348
0:14:20.12,000 --> 0:14:25,000
medication is being used in the hospital

349
0:14:22.49,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as a potential therapy I mean that is

350
0:14:25.28,000 --> 0:14:28,000
how fast a science is changing it was it

351
0:14:28.4,000 --> 0:14:31,000
was bad

352
0:14:29.12,000 --> 0:14:34,000
now it's potentially really good I mean

353
0:14:31.7,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I it's a constant process of keeping up

354
0:14:34.67,000 --> 0:14:38,000
with what the best evidence is telling

355
0:14:36.56,000 --> 0:14:4,000
us is right to do and I mean I'll just

356
0:14:39.11,000 --> 0:14:42,000
tell you you're always wondering am I

357
0:14:40.82,000 --> 0:14:44,000
getting it wrong right now as I feel

358
0:14:42.44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
like it's gonna be different in about 24

359
0:14:45.11,000 --> 0:14:51,000
hours and you just do the best that you

360
0:14:46.76,000 --> 0:14:52,000
can with with current information well I

361
0:14:51.23,000 --> 0:14:55,000
mean - you've been documenting your

362
0:14:53.69,000 --> 0:14:58,000
experiences and uh sort of talking about

363
0:14:56.03,000 --> 0:15:01,000
what how you've been going through this

364
0:14:58.76,000 --> 0:15:02,000
pandemic and your new podcast doctor's

365
0:15:01.13,000 --> 0:15:04,000
log and you know you've talked about

366
0:15:03.38,000 --> 0:15:07,000
some of the unique challenges that

367
0:15:04.66,000 --> 0:15:1,000
health workers are facing one of those

368
0:15:08.09,000 --> 0:15:13,000
being heightened exposure to the virus

369
0:15:10.94,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and so I'd love to talk about that a

370
0:15:13.28,000 --> 0:15:17,000
little bit just you know what are some

371
0:15:15.2,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of the physical ways what does the

372
0:15:17.6,000 --> 0:15:25,000
physical toll that this pandemic is

373
0:15:20.12,000 --> 0:15:31,000
having on health workers yeah this is

374
0:15:26.2,000 --> 0:15:33,000
this is so stressful I mean we are used

375
0:15:31.25,000 --> 0:15:36,000
to working under conditions where your

376
0:15:34.04,000 --> 0:15:39,000
risk is some nonzero number above that

377
0:15:36.62,000 --> 0:15:41,000
of the general population you know we

378
0:15:39.53,000 --> 0:15:44,000
see dangerous infections all the time

379
0:15:42.44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
there is violence in the health care

380
0:15:45.23,000 --> 0:15:49,000
works the workplace because of the

381
0:15:48.05,000 --> 0:15:52,000
volatility of what we see all the time

382
0:15:49.97,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and so there's a little bit of you know

383
0:15:52.46,000 --> 0:15:56,000
adrenaline there that's that's always

384
0:15:54.5,000 --> 0:15:57,000
present and that we we're used to over

385
0:15:56.75,000 --> 0:15:58,000
time you actually become completely a

386
0:15:58.07,000 --> 0:16:01,000
nerd to some of these things that aren't

387
0:15:59.57,000 --> 0:16:05,000
a part of other people's day-to-day

388
0:16:01.64,000 --> 0:16:06,000
existence but with this we have a you

389
0:16:05.87,000 --> 0:16:11,000
know a disease that's highly

390
0:16:07.37,000 --> 0:16:16,000
transmissible and also is is leads to

391
0:16:11.9,000 --> 0:16:17,000
very severe disease and so you know and

392
0:16:16.52,000 --> 0:16:2,000
then you throw in there the shortage of

393
0:16:18.53,000 --> 0:16:23,000
this one simple resource which is this

394
0:16:21.5,000 --> 0:16:26,000
personal protective equipment and when

395
0:16:24.35,000 --> 0:16:29,000
you put those three things together and

396
0:16:27.2,000 --> 0:16:32,000
we're seeing a high volume of patients

397
0:16:29.35,000 --> 0:16:35,000
it's you know it's it really becomes

398
0:16:32.54,000 --> 0:16:36,000
stressful on a different level because

399
0:16:35.39,000 --> 0:16:39,000
it's rare that we see something in the

400
0:16:37.22,000 --> 0:16:41,000
hospital where we have to worry what am

401
0:16:39.74,000 --> 0:16:43,000
i bringing home to my family member

402
0:16:41.42,000 --> 0:16:46,000
because I wasn't perfectly protected

403
0:16:44.27,000 --> 0:16:47,000
against this very dangerous disease and

404
0:16:46.52,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I think when you add on that layer of

405
0:16:48.2,000 --> 0:16:52,000
personal stress all the time am i right

406
0:16:51.11,000 --> 0:16:57,000
by doing this thing that I love to do

407
0:16:53.15,000 --> 0:16:57,000
care for patients am I putting my family

408
0:16:57.32,000 --> 0:16:59,000
at risk

409
0:16:57.77,000 --> 0:17:01,000
am i putting other patients at risk my

410
0:16:59.51,000 --> 0:17:04,000
colleagues at risk I think that has been

411
0:17:01.91,000 --> 0:17:06,000
one of the most emotionally draining

412
0:17:04.699,000 --> 0:17:1,000
things of this of this whole pandemic is

413
0:17:07.069,000 --> 0:17:13,000
just not just not being free to kind of

414
0:17:11.12,000 --> 0:17:15,000
go in and just do your clinical duty to

415
0:17:13.97,000 --> 0:17:17,000
the top of your potential but having

416
0:17:15.92,000 --> 0:17:2,000
this added layer of of constant stress

417
0:17:18.56,000 --> 0:17:24,000
about how much you're able to do it

418
0:17:21.319,000 --> 0:17:26,000
safely yeah I mean it's seeing these

419
0:17:25.1,000 --> 0:17:29,000
headlines really across the world about

420
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
the number of health workers who

421
0:17:29.92,000 --> 0:17:34,000
contract the virus and you know that

422
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
sort of thing is is is really upsetting

423
0:17:35.66,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and you know thank you doctor true for

424
0:17:39.32,000 --> 0:17:43,000
all you do and I think another thing

425
0:17:42.38,000 --> 0:17:45,000
that you talk about you know and also

426
0:17:43.91,000 --> 0:17:48,000
thinking about you mentioned not having

427
0:17:46.25,000 --> 0:17:5,000
PPE but also other equipment that we've

428
0:17:49.07,000 --> 0:17:52,000
seen a lot in the headlines that are

429
0:17:50.63,000 --> 0:17:54,000
we're lacking in the hospitals are

430
0:17:52.91,000 --> 0:17:56,000
shortage of our ventilators

431
0:17:55.52,000 --> 0:17:58,000
you've talked about this and how it's

432
0:17:57.65,000 --> 0:18:01,000
not just enough to think about the

433
0:17:59.45,000 --> 0:18:03,000
ventilators themselves but you know what

434
0:18:02.21,000 --> 0:18:05,000
are some other factors that we need to

435
0:18:03.74,000 --> 0:18:07,000
consider when we're thinking about the

436
0:18:06.2,000 --> 0:18:11,000
need for ventilators in in medical

437
0:18:08.21,000 --> 0:18:14,000
centers and hospitals yeah the the needs

438
0:18:11.9,000 --> 0:18:16,000
are so great and it's really everything

439
0:18:14.45,000 --> 0:18:2,000
that you know it's everything that

440
0:18:17.3,000 --> 0:18:22,000
surrounds the ventilator you know it's

441
0:18:21.05,000 --> 0:18:24,000
it none of these things live in

442
0:18:22.52,000 --> 0:18:25,000
isolation you know and so when I think

443
0:18:24.5,000 --> 0:18:27,000
of just the issue of the ventilator um

444
0:18:26.09,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that we're running out of it's like well

445
0:18:28.04,000 --> 0:18:32,000
you you actually need highly trained

446
0:18:29.57,000 --> 0:18:34,000
staff to use a ventilator it's not like

447
0:18:32.42,000 --> 0:18:35,000
you can just take anybody and just put

448
0:18:35.03,000 --> 0:18:39,000
them next to a ventilator and they can

449
0:18:36.17,000 --> 0:18:41,000
start programming it in this super fancy

450
0:18:39.5,000 --> 0:18:43,000
you know with with all skill and

451
0:18:41.93,000 --> 0:18:44,000
confidence you know we we rely on the

452
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
fact that there's a highly trained

453
0:18:45.41,000 --> 0:18:49,000
workforce including respiratory

454
0:18:46.76,000 --> 0:18:51,000
therapists intensive care unit trained

455
0:18:49.43,000 --> 0:18:55,000
specifically trained physicians nurses

456
0:18:52.52,000 --> 0:18:57,000
who are really experienced in ICU care

457
0:18:55.43,000 --> 0:19:,000
even to put somebody on a ventilator you

458
0:18:57.68,000 --> 0:19:01,000
need a number of common medications just

459
0:19:00.53,000 --> 0:19:03,000
a date and paralyze them so that they

460
0:19:02.27,000 --> 0:19:06,000
can tolerate the insertion of a pretty

461
0:19:04.28,000 --> 0:19:08,000
rigid plastic tube down their throat and

462
0:19:06.8,000 --> 0:19:09,000
then to keep them in a state that's

463
0:19:08.66,000 --> 0:19:12,000
comfortable so that they can stay on

464
0:19:10.58,000 --> 0:19:15,000
that tube for many many days which is a

465
0:19:13.28,000 --> 0:19:18,000
very uncomfortable thing actually and so

466
0:19:16.57,000 --> 0:19:19,000
you know and so we need all of those

467
0:19:18.8,000 --> 0:19:22,000
medications and we need them in pretty

468
0:19:20.36,000 --> 0:19:23,000
large quantities and then of course you

469
0:19:23.12,000 --> 0:19:26,000
know ventilators need to go into

470
0:19:24.23,000 --> 0:19:28,000
intensive care units those intensive

471
0:19:26.96,000 --> 0:19:3,000
care units require a lot of maintenance

472
0:19:28.67,000 --> 0:19:33,000
I mean the cleaning staff to to clean a

473
0:19:31.9,000 --> 0:19:36,000
intensive care unit where there's been a

474
0:19:34.13,000 --> 0:19:38,000
kovat positive patient in these our

475
0:19:37.4,000 --> 0:19:4,000
larger rooms they have a lot of

476
0:19:38.48,000 --> 0:19:43,000
equipment in it often the cleaning after

477
0:19:41.03,000 --> 0:19:45,000
a Koba 19 patient to do it right and

478
0:19:43.52,000 --> 0:19:46,000
disinfect that space so it's safe for

479
0:19:45.08,000 --> 0:19:49,000
the next patient that's an hour and

480
0:19:47.18,000 --> 0:19:52,000
twenty to thirty minute process or more

481
0:19:49.28,000 --> 0:19:54,000
depending on the facility so or that

482
0:19:52.28,000 --> 0:19:56,000
that room is just out of use and so I

483
0:19:54.44,000 --> 0:19:58,000
mean there really is a complex team that

484
0:19:56.39,000 --> 0:19:59,000
it takes in order to maintain an

485
0:19:58.55,000 --> 0:20:02,000
intensive care unit around a single

486
0:20:00.17,000 --> 0:20:04,000
machine it's really hard to to convey

487
0:20:03.17,000 --> 0:20:06,000
that all the time you know it's a lot

488
0:20:04.85,000 --> 0:20:08,000
easier to say we need the single

489
0:20:06.41,000 --> 0:20:11,000
resource let's manufacture it and get it

490
0:20:08.93,000 --> 0:20:12,000
there and I will say to just this this

491
0:20:11.9,000 --> 0:20:14,000
whole thing is really such an education

492
0:20:13.49,000 --> 0:20:18,000
on public health messaging and how we

493
0:20:15.23,000 --> 0:20:2,000
get ordinary people and policymakers to

494
0:20:18.65,000 --> 0:20:21,000
kind of get galvanized around some of

495
0:20:20.39,000 --> 0:20:23,000
these issues that are buried deep within

496
0:20:21.86,000 --> 0:20:25,000
a hospital it's like the deeper you get

497
0:20:23.9,000 --> 0:20:26,000
into a hospital and the further you get

498
0:20:26.12,000 --> 0:20:29,000
from outside of it the harder it is to

499
0:20:27.77,000 --> 0:20:3,000
communicate these needs and so you know

500
0:20:29.93,000 --> 0:20:32,000
testing was something that was very

501
0:20:31.55,000 --> 0:20:34,000
relatable to people and that we were

502
0:20:33.11,000 --> 0:20:37,000
really able to raise public outrage

503
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:38,000
about because everybody suddenly wanted

504
0:20:37.31,000 --> 0:20:42,000
to get tested right I mean you had a

505
0:20:38.75,000 --> 0:20:43,000
virus the the the the Cova 19 disease

506
0:20:42.59,000 --> 0:20:45,000
was in the country you wanted to know

507
0:20:43.88,000 --> 0:20:46,000
whether you had it and so if you didn't

508
0:20:46.28,000 --> 0:20:5,000
then something you knew really wanted

509
0:20:47.75,000 --> 0:20:51,000
that test PPE the personal protective

510
0:20:50.63,000 --> 0:20:54,000
equipment that was a little harder

511
0:20:52.01,000 --> 0:20:56,000
that's the first step into the hospital

512
0:20:54.68,000 --> 0:20:57,000
what do you need if you're working on

513
0:20:56.06,000 --> 0:21:,000
copa90 and you need some PPE and so and

514
0:20:58.55,000 --> 0:21:02,000
there was something so visual about it

515
0:21:00.5,000 --> 0:21:04,000
right we saw pictures of healthcare

516
0:21:03.02,000 --> 0:21:07,000
workers with their masks and their

517
0:21:04.61,000 --> 0:21:08,000
goggles and their gowns and and we saw

518
0:21:07.28,000 --> 0:21:1,000
those images from other countries where

519
0:21:09.53,000 --> 0:21:12,000
they were wearing them or not wearing

520
0:21:11.12,000 --> 0:21:14,000
them you see the pictures on one of the

521
0:21:13.43,000 --> 0:21:16,000
most vivid pictures I think that will

522
0:21:14.96,000 --> 0:21:17,000
remain in people's memories after this

523
0:21:16.94,000 --> 0:21:19,000
is the pictures of the health care

524
0:21:18.14,000 --> 0:21:22,000
workers with the bruises around their

525
0:21:19.94,000 --> 0:21:24,000
faces for wearing these masks non-stop

526
0:21:23.05,000 --> 0:21:26,000
because normally we don't always wear

527
0:21:25.34,000 --> 0:21:27,000
personal protective equipment for every

528
0:21:26.81,000 --> 0:21:28,000
single patient but having to wear it for

529
0:21:28.22,000 --> 0:21:31,000
patient after patient for hundreds of

530
0:21:29.78,000 --> 0:21:32,000
patients over a shift people started to

531
0:21:31.94,000 --> 0:21:35,000
get bruising on their faces and there

532
0:21:33.56,000 --> 0:21:38,000
was something so visual and visceral and

533
0:21:36.86,000 --> 0:21:4,000
relatable about that and so we got

534
0:21:38.93,000 --> 0:21:41,000
people really excited about PPE and I'm

535
0:21:41.15,000 --> 0:21:45,000
so glad because I think we won't get

536
0:21:42.89,000 --> 0:21:47,000
relief in those in that resource soon

537
0:21:45.82,000 --> 0:21:5,000
after that our ability to kind of

538
0:21:48.71,000 --> 0:21:53,000
communicate our needs are as critical as

539
0:21:51.8,000 --> 0:21:56,000
they are they may be as critical as PPE

540
0:21:53.87,000 --> 0:21:57,000
and as testing once you get downstream

541
0:21:56.93,000 --> 0:21:59,000
to a stage of disease where you need to

542
0:21:58.67,000 --> 0:22:01,000
be treated in the hospital it's very

543
0:22:00.68,000 --> 0:22:04,000
hard to communicate how badly we need

544
0:22:02.48,000 --> 0:22:07,000
these things and get the kind of you

545
0:22:05.33,000 --> 0:22:1,000
know the public interest and an outrage

546
0:22:08.39,000 --> 0:22:14,000
and energy around it but really every

547
0:22:11.18,000 --> 0:22:18,000
single thing that we need in the

548
0:22:15.14,000 --> 0:22:21,000
hospital is is we're starting to strain

549
0:22:18.23,000 --> 0:22:25,000
the supply I'd love to

550
0:22:21.92,000 --> 0:22:27,000
I fell in here yeah yeah please Helen so

551
0:22:25.46,000 --> 0:22:29,000
many questions pouring into Facebook so

552
0:22:27.95,000 --> 0:22:32,000
I'll just share a couple and then I'll

553
0:22:29.84,000 --> 0:22:33,000
jump back off but I think overwhelming

554
0:22:33.05,000 --> 0:22:39,000
made the number one question that people

555
0:22:34.43,000 --> 0:22:41,000
have is how can they help alright I'm

556
0:22:39.86,000 --> 0:22:47,000
sorry that question just kind of kills

557
0:22:41.48,000 --> 0:22:5,000
me it kills me every time and you think

558
0:22:48.35,000 --> 0:22:57,000
I'd be ready for it because how many

559
0:22:51.17,000 --> 0:23:04,000
people are asking me so Oh give me a

560
0:22:57.53,000 --> 0:23:06,000
second first of all everyone who asked

561
0:23:04.31,000 --> 0:23:1,000
that question thank you I mean we feel

562
0:23:06.95,000 --> 0:23:11,000
feel the outpouring of goodwill and and

563
0:23:10.4,000 --> 0:23:13,000
I mean that is honestly what keeps us

564
0:23:12.59,000 --> 0:23:15,000
going to work every single day and gives

565
0:23:14.15,000 --> 0:23:19,000
us energy to do this and it actually it

566
0:23:16.4,000 --> 0:23:21,000
makes me feel like how can I do more so

567
0:23:19.91,000 --> 0:23:24,000
thank you and I will say there there are

568
0:23:21.92,000 --> 0:23:27,000
a million ways to help I'll throw it a

569
0:23:25.67,000 --> 0:23:29,000
couple of simple things the first of all

570
0:23:28.46,000 --> 0:23:33,000
whatever you do to help your own

571
0:23:30.29,000 --> 0:23:35,000
community helps us so even if you're not

572
0:23:33.86,000 --> 0:23:36,000
out there I mean a lot of people are

573
0:23:35.42,000 --> 0:23:39,000
selling face masks and things are

574
0:23:37.19,000 --> 0:23:41,000
contributing to you know to the to

575
0:23:40.04,000 --> 0:23:44,000
increasing the supply of PPE and that's

576
0:23:41.84,000 --> 0:23:45,000
wonderful but but it doesn't have to be

577
0:23:44.12,000 --> 0:23:48,000
that literal so when you contribute to

578
0:23:46.4,000 --> 0:23:5,000
your local food bank your local homeless

579
0:23:48.41,000 --> 0:23:54,000
or domestic violence shelter your local

580
0:23:50.78,000 --> 0:23:55,000
diaper bank in any way contributing to

581
0:23:54.71,000 --> 0:23:57,000
the needs of the community around here

582
0:23:56.15,000 --> 0:24:,000
you are helping us and I will tell you

583
0:23:57.89,000 --> 0:24:01,000
even in times of pandemic we are seeing

584
0:24:00.59,000 --> 0:24:03,000
people come to the hospital because they

585
0:24:02.57,000 --> 0:24:04,000
are lacking food and they are lacking

586
0:24:03.77,000 --> 0:24:07,000
shelter because those needs are still

587
0:24:05.42,000 --> 0:24:09,000
paramount for people and so when you

588
0:24:07.79,000 --> 0:24:11,000
help in those ways that is healthcare

589
0:24:10.1,000 --> 0:24:14,000
that you are giving directly and you are

590
0:24:12.65,000 --> 0:24:16,000
helping us every single day keep people

591
0:24:14.75,000 --> 0:24:19,000
healthy so those things are so valuable

592
0:24:16.91,000 --> 0:24:21,000
I think the second thing is to come into

593
0:24:20.57,000 --> 0:24:24,000
the healthcare mentality which is that

594
0:24:22.64,000 --> 0:24:27,000
this is not going to be short it is

595
0:24:25.52,000 --> 0:24:29,000
going to be prolonged and there is no

596
0:24:27.83,000 --> 0:24:3,000
single campaign that will win this thing

597
0:24:29.93,000 --> 0:24:33,000
they're going to be many campaigns after

598
0:24:31.789,000 --> 0:24:35,000
campaigns and I always feel like I'm

599
0:24:34.009,000 --> 0:24:38,000
giving bad news but I want people to

600
0:24:36.139,000 --> 0:24:4,000
kind of spread the word that this needs

601
0:24:38.509,000 --> 0:24:42,000
to be a really sustained effort we don't

602
0:24:40.789,000 --> 0:24:43,000
have an end date we may even have a

603
0:24:42.71,000 --> 0:24:45,000
second surge of disease on particularly

604
0:24:44.629,000 --> 0:24:47,000
if you don't get this right we don't

605
0:24:46.34,000 --> 0:24:5,000
have a timing for things like vaccines

606
0:24:48.279,000 --> 0:24:54,000
and effective treatments those things

607
0:24:51.08,000 --> 0:24:55,000
simply take time so I would say take the

608
0:24:54.409,000 --> 0:24:58,000
little breaks that you need to from

609
0:24:56.029,000 --> 0:25:01,000
you're helping roll help when you have

610
0:24:58.549,000 --> 0:25:03,000
the energy and you know and the

611
0:25:01.879,000 --> 0:25:05,000
resources to do so but also take time

612
0:25:03.919,000 --> 0:25:07,000
for yourself but understand that this is

613
0:25:06.2,000 --> 0:25:1,000
not going to be short and then the last

614
0:25:08.57,000 --> 0:25:12,000
thing I would say is remember that

615
0:25:10.759,000 --> 0:25:15,000
sometimes what we don't do is as

616
0:25:13.249,000 --> 0:25:17,000
important as what we do do and so people

617
0:25:16.519,000 --> 0:25:19,000
are always worried that they haven't

618
0:25:17.869,000 --> 0:25:2,000
done enough but remember that restraint

619
0:25:19.609,000 --> 0:25:23,000
is so important here and one example

620
0:25:21.559,000 --> 0:25:26,000
I'll give is every time there's a whiff

621
0:25:24.019,000 --> 0:25:29,000
of promise around a medication people

622
0:25:26.809,000 --> 0:25:3,000
are going out and they are they are

623
0:25:29.109,000 --> 0:25:33,000
trying to get people to prescribe it to

624
0:25:31.129,000 --> 0:25:35,000
them they're they're filling these

625
0:25:33.44,000 --> 0:25:38,000
prescriptions and in quantities that are

626
0:25:36.049,000 --> 0:25:4,000
much higher than than anybody needs and

627
0:25:38.96,000 --> 0:25:41,000
really there's some medication hoarding

628
0:25:40.7,000 --> 0:25:44,000
that's going on so I would ask people

629
0:25:42.619,000 --> 0:25:45,000
you know wait for the evidence and the

630
0:25:44.779,000 --> 0:25:47,000
recommendations please let health

631
0:25:46.46,000 --> 0:25:5,000
professionals guide how we use these

632
0:25:48.499,000 --> 0:25:52,000
resources and and please don't do the

633
0:25:51.44,000 --> 0:25:55,000
toilet-paper thing for any resource in

634
0:25:53.479,000 --> 0:25:58,000
healthcare we need to we need to have

635
0:25:56.179,000 --> 0:26:01,000
enough restraint that the limited

636
0:25:58.729,000 --> 0:26:02,000
resources we have yet to those who

637
0:26:01.22,000 --> 0:26:04,000
really need them that goes for a number

638
0:26:03.32,000 --> 0:26:06,000
of things also those you know hi Phil

639
0:26:05.179,000 --> 0:26:08,000
tration facemasks some people in the

640
0:26:07.039,000 --> 0:26:1,000
public do not need to be wearing those

641
0:26:08.599,000 --> 0:26:12,000
and those should go directly to health

642
0:26:10.249,000 --> 0:26:14,000
care workers one of the question and

643
0:26:13.489,000 --> 0:26:17,000
then I'll jump back into the comments

644
0:26:15.169,000 --> 0:26:19,000
but even there's a question around the

645
0:26:17.539,000 --> 0:26:2,000
risk of using a drug for something it

646
0:26:19.309,000 --> 0:26:22,000
wasn't intended and I guess this is a

647
0:26:21.08,000 --> 0:26:25,000
reference to Cora Queen which has become

648
0:26:23.09,000 --> 0:26:27,000
a kind of a word that non-medical

649
0:26:25.46,000 --> 0:26:29,000
professionals are now using liberally

650
0:26:27.32,000 --> 0:26:32,000
but what do you make of the kind of the

651
0:26:29.69,000 --> 0:26:34,000
sudden resurgence of people's awareness

652
0:26:32.33,000 --> 0:26:37,000
and knowledge of chloroquine and what

653
0:26:34.909,000 --> 0:26:4,000
should we actually think about it yeah

654
0:26:37.879,000 --> 0:26:42,000
there you know every time there is a

655
0:26:41.33,000 --> 0:26:44,000
pandemic there are a number of

656
0:26:43.669,000 --> 0:26:47,000
medications that have the

657
0:26:45.32,000 --> 0:26:52,000
radical benefit because they have in

658
0:26:48.649,000 --> 0:26:55,000
vitro action against against the virus

659
0:26:52.49,000 --> 0:26:57,000
and there have been many disappointments

660
0:26:55.759,000 --> 0:26:59,000
I mean all all these medications that

661
0:26:58.37,000 --> 0:27:01,000
we're talking about hydrochloric win and

662
0:26:59.84,000 --> 0:27:02,000
as if through Meissen and antivirals

663
0:27:02.09,000 --> 0:27:05,000
that are effective against different

664
0:27:03.289,000 --> 0:27:09,000
viruses we wonder can it work against

665
0:27:05.87,000 --> 0:27:11,000
this virus maybe the excitement about

666
0:27:09.559,000 --> 0:27:12,000
these medications hydroxychloroquine i

667
0:27:12.11,000 --> 0:27:15,000
think is the one that's been mentioned

668
0:27:13.309,000 --> 0:27:17,000
the most I mean really through the roof

669
0:27:15.38,000 --> 0:27:2,000
I'm excited too it would be nice to know

670
0:27:17.57,000 --> 0:27:22,000
if it works we have very little data on

671
0:27:20.69,000 --> 0:27:24,000
these we have not been able to do these

672
0:27:23.299,000 --> 0:27:28,000
randomized control trials that will

673
0:27:25.309,000 --> 0:27:3,000
allow us to know not only are they

674
0:27:28.519,000 --> 0:27:34,000
effective but is the is the good that

675
0:27:31.07,000 --> 0:27:36,000
they're doing does it exceed the harms

676
0:27:35.21,000 --> 0:27:4,000
because all these medications have

677
0:27:36.95,000 --> 0:27:4,000
potential toxicity on you know they have

678
0:27:40.429,000 --> 0:27:43,000
psychiatric side effects they have

679
0:27:41.87,000 --> 0:27:44,000
cardio toxicity particularly in

680
0:27:43.58,000 --> 0:27:47,000
combination with other medications that

681
0:27:45.799,000 --> 0:27:49,000
affect your heart they can cause very

682
0:27:48.049,000 --> 0:27:53,000
serious illness seizures and even death

683
0:27:50.33,000 --> 0:27:58,000
and we've seen we've seen an early death

684
0:27:53.259,000 --> 0:28:01,000
from from the use of chloroquine so so a

685
0:27:58.49,000 --> 0:28:03,000
lot of caution here in every sense there

686
0:28:01.94,000 --> 0:28:05,000
is no indication for people to go out

687
0:28:03.679,000 --> 0:28:07,000
and start using these medications as

688
0:28:06.379,000 --> 0:28:1,000
either prophylaxis or treatment I'm

689
0:28:08.6,000 --> 0:28:12,000
really worried about how people can hurt

690
0:28:10.669,000 --> 0:28:13,000
themselves and advertently particularly

691
0:28:12.649,000 --> 0:28:14,000
if they're taking these outside the

692
0:28:13.82,000 --> 0:28:16,000
recommendation of a health professional

693
0:28:15.23,000 --> 0:28:18,000
I mean that's just a nightmare waiting

694
0:28:17.33,000 --> 0:28:21,000
to happen and I'll also say I mean this

695
0:28:19.009,000 --> 0:28:23,000
goes in line with with the issue of

696
0:28:21.44,000 --> 0:28:25,000
medication shortages but I mean the the

697
0:28:23.36,000 --> 0:28:29,000
treatment for hydroxychloroquine or

698
0:28:26.21,000 --> 0:28:31,000
chloroquine overdoses is is generally

699
0:28:30.009,000 --> 0:28:33,000
benzodiazepines which is another

700
0:28:31.519,000 --> 0:28:34,000
medication that we're in very short

701
0:28:33.86,000 --> 0:28:37,000
supply of we need critically for

702
0:28:35.48,000 --> 0:28:42,000
intensive care unit patients and so you

703
0:28:38.809,000 --> 0:28:44,000
know everything has consequences that we

704
0:28:42.559,000 --> 0:28:47,000
will then have to grapple with so not

705
0:28:45.789,000 --> 0:28:49,000
you know unsupported you so these

706
0:28:47.929,000 --> 0:28:5,000
medications this really has the

707
0:28:49.909,000 --> 0:28:53,000
potential to be another disaster buried

708
0:28:51.47,000 --> 0:28:55,000
within this disaster we do not want that

709
0:28:54.559,000 --> 0:28:58,000
okay I'm jumping off thank you so much

710
0:28:56.299,000 --> 0:28:58,000
back to you Whitney

711
0:28:59.13,000 --> 0:29:05,000
Helen you know it's so you talked about

712
0:29:03.5,000 --> 0:29:07,000
sort of how you've been advocating for

713
0:29:05.52,000 --> 0:29:09,000
PPE and our need for that and you

714
0:29:08.34,000 --> 0:29:12,000
advocate for a lot of things in this

715
0:29:10.17,000 --> 0:29:13,000
public health space that I think are

716
0:29:12.75,000 --> 0:29:16,000
just really critically important at this

717
0:29:14.04,000 --> 0:29:19,000
time and one of those things is the work

718
0:29:17.31,000 --> 0:29:2,000
that you're doing with chip health and

719
0:29:19.44,000 --> 0:29:24,000
I'd love to talk a little bit about that

720
0:29:20.76,000 --> 0:29:26,000
as far as looking at building emergency

721
0:29:24.87,000 --> 0:29:29,000
health centers and creating these spaces

722
0:29:27.48,000 --> 0:29:32,000
at this time and as we're seeing that

723
0:29:30.51,000 --> 0:29:35,000
hospitals are overcrowded throughout the

724
0:29:33.12,000 --> 0:29:38,000
country the world you know I guess how

725
0:29:35.82,000 --> 0:29:41,000
how long before we get to a point where

726
0:29:38.13,000 --> 0:29:44,000
where we really are beyond capacity and

727
0:29:42.21,000 --> 0:29:48,000
and need to seek out alternative

728
0:29:44.76,000 --> 0:29:49,000
measures yeah we're already seeing it in

729
0:29:48.75,000 --> 0:29:52,000
New York and I think we will actually

730
0:29:50.07,000 --> 0:29:55,000
see this space shortage in every major

731
0:29:52.92,000 --> 0:29:57,000
city and then a different kind of space

732
0:29:55.23,000 --> 0:30:01,000
shortage actually in rural and critical

733
0:29:58.14,000 --> 0:30:02,000
access areas so you know in large cities

734
0:30:01.35,000 --> 0:30:03,000
we're running out of space in every

735
0:30:02.58,000 --> 0:30:05,000
single cup you know if every single kind

736
0:30:04.17,000 --> 0:30:07,000
so yes it is the intensive care units

737
0:30:06.03,000 --> 0:30:08,000
and it's the hospital wards and it's a

738
0:30:07.53,000 --> 0:30:1,000
space in the emergency department and

739
0:30:09,000 --> 0:30:13,000
you've seen these I think you've seen

740
0:30:10.8,000 --> 0:30:14,000
these pictures in in emergency medicine

741
0:30:13.62,000 --> 0:30:18,000
triage where people packed in there like

742
0:30:15.51,000 --> 0:30:2,000
sardines no doubt transmitting disease

743
0:30:19.41,000 --> 0:30:22,000
while they're waiting you know and so

744
0:30:21.45,000 --> 0:30:25,000
some hospitals are bumping out to large

745
0:30:23.13,000 --> 0:30:26,000
tents places where they can enforce try

746
0:30:25.65,000 --> 0:30:27,000
to enforce social distancing while

747
0:30:27.09,000 --> 0:30:31,000
people are waiting to be seen some of

748
0:30:28.62,000 --> 0:30:33,000
them very sick but there's also housing

749
0:30:32.07,000 --> 0:30:36,000
needs around health care so increasingly

750
0:30:34.05,000 --> 0:30:38,000
as we're seeing many many very static

751
0:30:36.66,000 --> 0:30:4,000
Ovid patients and particularly when you

752
0:30:38.4,000 --> 0:30:43,000
add in that layer of inadequate PPE our

753
0:30:41.61,000 --> 0:30:44,000
personal protective equipment um health

754
0:30:43.95,000 --> 0:30:47,000
care workers are not wanting to go home

755
0:30:45.51,000 --> 0:30:51,000
and that's a very reasonable thing to

756
0:30:48.06,000 --> 0:30:54,000
watch because we we want to we want to

757
0:30:52.26,000 --> 0:30:56,000
shield our families as we do this I mean

758
0:30:54.93,000 --> 0:30:57,000
a number of many many health care

759
0:30:57.18,000 --> 0:31:,000
workers I know are sick and have to go

760
0:30:58.89,000 --> 0:31:01,000
into quarantine away from their families

761
0:31:00.39,000 --> 0:31:05,000
and so where do we do that I mean

762
0:31:02.7,000 --> 0:31:07,000
hospitals are only equipped to handle a

763
0:31:05.58,000 --> 0:31:09,000
very small handful of health care

764
0:31:08.22,000 --> 0:31:12,000
workers spending the night you know so

765
0:31:10.14,000 --> 0:31:12,000
you go into any hospital in a regular

766
0:31:12.27,000 --> 0:31:14,000
time in the

767
0:31:12.97,000 --> 0:31:16,000
they're empty at night and you just have

768
0:31:14.5,000 --> 0:31:21,000
a tiny handful of physicians who are

769
0:31:17.559,000 --> 0:31:23,000
required to stay in house overnight this

770
0:31:21.61,000 --> 0:31:25,000
is to sleep there you know between

771
0:31:23.789,000 --> 0:31:27,000
between daytime hours and so you'll have

772
0:31:26.23,000 --> 0:31:32,000
a couple of call rooms and now we have

773
0:31:28.21,000 --> 0:31:34,000
this this situation where a large

774
0:31:32.32,000 --> 0:31:37,000
portion of our healthcare staff does not

775
0:31:35.11,000 --> 0:31:39,000
want to go home in between and so we're

776
0:31:37.75,000 --> 0:31:4,000
getting really generous offers I mean in

777
0:31:39.73,000 --> 0:31:43,000
the in New York City for example the

778
0:31:41.71,000 --> 0:31:46,000
Four Seasons offered its hotel rooms up

779
0:31:44.559,000 --> 0:31:48,000
to up to health care workers who wanted

780
0:31:47.08,000 --> 0:31:5,000
to stay there to keep their families

781
0:31:48.64,000 --> 0:31:52,000
safe or to avoid the commute between

782
0:31:50.65,000 --> 0:31:55,000
shifts and that's great but you know

783
0:31:53.26,000 --> 0:31:58,000
most hospitals aren't lucky enough to be

784
0:31:55.659,000 --> 0:32:,000
next door to a luxury hotel where they

785
0:31:58.539,000 --> 0:32:02,000
can spend a month and so how are we

786
0:32:01.15,000 --> 0:32:06,000
pumping out housing in addition to all

787
0:32:03.28,000 --> 0:32:08,000
the health care space we need and and so

788
0:32:07.059,000 --> 0:32:11,000
that's why I started working with this

789
0:32:09.1,000 --> 0:32:13,000
amazing team it's a project called Joop

790
0:32:11.919,000 --> 0:32:17,000
health and we're building three kinds of

791
0:32:13.87,000 --> 0:32:19,000
units as fast as we can so this this

792
0:32:18.159,000 --> 0:32:22,000
expanded housing for health care workers

793
0:32:19.929,000 --> 0:32:23,000
and actually for other people who have

794
0:32:22.299,000 --> 0:32:26,000
covin 19 or likely have codon koba 19

795
0:32:24.64,000 --> 0:32:28,000
and cannot go back to their their living

796
0:32:27.25,000 --> 0:32:3,000
situation for whatever reasons so you

797
0:32:28.78,000 --> 0:32:31,000
think of people living in homeless

798
0:32:30.7,000 --> 0:32:35,000
shelters domestic violence shelters

799
0:32:32.08,000 --> 0:32:38,000
group homes nursing homes correctional

800
0:32:36.039,000 --> 0:32:41,000
facilities psychiatric units basically

801
0:32:38.919,000 --> 0:32:42,000
all these places that we're calling

802
0:32:41.26,000 --> 0:32:45,000
coronavirus traps because people are

803
0:32:43.69,000 --> 0:32:48,000
held in there there is no option for

804
0:32:46.21,000 --> 0:32:5,000
social distancing and the infection is

805
0:32:49.179,000 --> 0:32:53,000
spreading like wildfire fire unless we

806
0:32:51.07,000 --> 0:32:55,000
take known cases and actually pull them

807
0:32:53.89,000 --> 0:32:57,000
out so expanded housing can be used for

808
0:32:55.9,000 --> 0:33:,000
any of those populations and then basic

809
0:32:58.57,000 --> 0:33:03,000
hospital beds and then and then actually

810
0:33:01.419,000 --> 0:33:06,000
these these mobile intensive care units

811
0:33:04.299,000 --> 0:33:08,000
that are being designed with

812
0:33:06.63,000 --> 0:33:1,000
architecture design teams engineering

813
0:33:08.77,000 --> 0:33:11,000
teams and a whole bunch of health

814
0:33:10.84,000 --> 0:33:13,000
professionals and also patients and

815
0:33:12.429,000 --> 0:33:16,000
patient advocates and we're trying to

816
0:33:14.02,000 --> 0:33:18,000
make a very functional space that can be

817
0:33:17.409,000 --> 0:33:2,000
shipped anywhere in the United States

818
0:33:18.669,000 --> 0:33:23,000
very quickly there are hospitals in

819
0:33:21.399,000 --> 0:33:25,000
remote areas that don't have hundreds of

820
0:33:23.83,000 --> 0:33:26,000
ICU beds that they can mobilize they

821
0:33:25.57,000 --> 0:33:28,000
might have two ICU

822
0:33:27.27,000 --> 0:33:3,000
but all of a sudden they're not able to

823
0:33:28.92,000 --> 0:33:31,000
transfer all the kovat patients that

824
0:33:30.6,000 --> 0:33:33,000
they need to take care of and so we want

825
0:33:32.46,000 --> 0:33:34,000
to see that their needs as well as we

826
0:33:33.9,000 --> 0:33:36,000
see that the needs of people and very

827
0:33:35.4,000 --> 0:33:38,000
densely populated areas that simply

828
0:33:37.08,000 --> 0:33:41,000
don't have room I mean I think the

829
0:33:38.64,000 --> 0:33:45,000
reality is we can't you know we can't

830
0:33:41.64,000 --> 0:33:47,000
run hospitals that have have endless

831
0:33:46.14,000 --> 0:33:49,000
capacity for surge I mean that's just

832
0:33:47.91,000 --> 0:33:5,000
not something that you can build and

833
0:33:49.32,000 --> 0:33:55,000
maintain so what are creative ways we

834
0:33:51.6,000 --> 0:33:59,000
can we can do this we can create very

835
0:33:55.74,000 --> 0:34:,000
deployable extra space not just for this

836
0:33:59.67,000 --> 0:34:05,000
crisis but but for every single other

837
0:34:01.65,000 --> 0:34:06,000
one that we face moving forward and you

838
0:34:06.03,000 --> 0:34:09,000
know when you think about these needs

839
0:34:07.56,000 --> 0:34:12,000
for health workers and and just for the

840
0:34:09.72,000 --> 0:34:15,000
broader community you know how much of

841
0:34:12.78,000 --> 0:34:17,000
this is on the government and I you know

842
0:34:15.96,000 --> 0:34:2,000
and I'm curious to hear I guess what you

843
0:34:18.54,000 --> 0:34:22,000
feel like in thinking about this crisis

844
0:34:21.36,000 --> 0:34:25,000
what the government has getting right

845
0:34:23.37,000 --> 0:34:27,000
both on the federal state level and then

846
0:34:25.71,000 --> 0:34:32,000
what are some of the areas that really

847
0:34:27.89,000 --> 0:34:34,000
still need more attention yeah I mean I

848
0:34:33.18,000 --> 0:34:37,000
I think it's pretty fair to say that the

849
0:34:35.54,000 --> 0:34:37,000
government response as a whole has been

850
0:34:37.65,000 --> 0:34:41,000
disappointing

851
0:34:38.48,000 --> 0:34:43,000
the biggest tragedy is that when that's

852
0:34:41.7,000 --> 0:34:46,000
those first cases came in the United

853
0:34:44.31,000 --> 0:34:5,000
States that we didn't get on top of the

854
0:34:46.86,000 --> 0:34:52,000
testing that day not even that day the

855
0:34:50.64,000 --> 0:34:53,000
month before when we knew that this was

856
0:34:53.07,000 --> 0:34:58,000
starting to spread and it was clear this

857
0:34:54.6,000 --> 0:35:01,000
was going to be a global pandemic it

858
0:34:58.37,000 --> 0:35:03,000
really I find it hard to even think

859
0:35:01.77,000 --> 0:35:06,000
about because I it's so upsetting that

860
0:35:04.26,000 --> 0:35:1,000
we didn't just roll out testing encase

861
0:35:07.5,000 --> 0:35:12,000
and contact identification very

862
0:35:10.26,000 --> 0:35:14,000
assertively from the beginning I mean

863
0:35:12.51,000 --> 0:35:15,000
that was the difference between what

864
0:35:14.49,000 --> 0:35:2,000
will ultimately be hundreds of thousands

865
0:35:16.5,000 --> 0:35:23,000
of lives lost and and and having saved

866
0:35:21.27,000 --> 0:35:25,000
all those lives will be that early thing

867
0:35:24.03,000 --> 0:35:3,000
and you know you're psychologically it's

868
0:35:25.86,000 --> 0:35:32,000
so bad to dwell I'm trying not to dwell

869
0:35:30.36,000 --> 0:35:34,000
on that first mistake but and really

870
0:35:32.94,000 --> 0:35:4,000
just kind of move forward and say okay

871
0:35:34.89,000 --> 0:35:42,000
how do we avoid that that that

872
0:35:41.2,000 --> 0:35:45,000
and that's kind of been where I'm trying

873
0:35:43.359,000 --> 0:35:46,000
to push the conversation like okay

874
0:35:45.279,000 --> 0:35:49,000
what's the next thing you know it's like

875
0:35:47.229,000 --> 0:35:5,000
okay we're kind of got behind testing we

876
0:35:49.63,000 --> 0:35:52,000
still aren't where we need to be with

877
0:35:50.65,000 --> 0:35:54,000
testing but then then what you know what

878
0:35:53.38,000 --> 0:35:55,000
are the other containment measures and

879
0:35:54.759,000 --> 0:35:56,000
then when we get to the you know

880
0:35:55.93,000 --> 0:35:58,000
downstream to the treatment everything's

881
0:35:57.67,000 --> 0:36:,000
really about containment and then

882
0:35:59.109,000 --> 0:36:03,000
treatment capacity and I I think

883
0:36:01.63,000 --> 0:36:05,000
containment is where I really wanted to

884
0:36:03.249,000 --> 0:36:07,000
focus and then it was like okay well we

885
0:36:05.829,000 --> 0:36:08,000
because we failed in containment we

886
0:36:07.63,000 --> 0:36:12,000
better shift quickly and think about

887
0:36:09.039,000 --> 0:36:15,000
here escalation so how do we expand our

888
0:36:13.239,000 --> 0:36:16,000
care capacity and it's sad to me that's

889
0:36:15.369,000 --> 0:36:17,000
that's where I need to be but since

890
0:36:16.63,000 --> 0:36:19,000
we're going to be doing large-scale care

891
0:36:18.309,000 --> 0:36:23,000
what are all the little gaps that we

892
0:36:20.499,000 --> 0:36:25,000
need to fill so and I think the really

893
0:36:23.469,000 --> 0:36:28,000
hard thing I mean I've been involved in

894
0:36:26.349,000 --> 0:36:33,000
in these organizations to try to improve

895
0:36:29.349,000 --> 0:36:35,000
our PPE supply and the and I can you

896
0:36:33.969,000 --> 0:36:36,000
know we're all so many hundreds of

897
0:36:36.069,000 --> 0:36:39,000
thousands of people are involved in this

898
0:36:37.359,000 --> 0:36:42,000
and and I think we're able to boost

899
0:36:39.219,000 --> 0:36:46,000
supply here and there and and have have

900
0:36:42.609,000 --> 0:36:47,000
some successes but what we can't do what

901
0:36:46.749,000 --> 0:36:52,000
is very hard to do on the grassroots

902
0:36:48.16,000 --> 0:36:55,000
level is to centralize our understanding

903
0:36:52.869,000 --> 0:36:57,000
of the problem I mean there should be in

904
0:36:55.569,000 --> 0:37:,000
an ideal world a national command center

905
0:36:58.749,000 --> 0:37:04,000
that has its fingers on the pulse across

906
0:37:00.999,000 --> 0:37:06,000
all 50 states that knows where are all

907
0:37:04.96,000 --> 0:37:11,000
of our hospitals and health systems and

908
0:37:07.599,000 --> 0:37:14,000
clinics what are their patient caseloads

909
0:37:12.009,000 --> 0:37:16,000
like and what do they need of every

910
0:37:14.89,000 --> 0:37:18,000
single resource whether it's human

911
0:37:16.869,000 --> 0:37:21,000
resources or or these concrete sees

912
0:37:19.17,000 --> 0:37:26,000
these recent these supply resources and

913
0:37:22.45,000 --> 0:37:29,000
then understands the national supply and

914
0:37:26.589,000 --> 0:37:31,000
can divert resources exactly where they

915
0:37:29.589,000 --> 0:37:33,000
need to go at the exact right time

916
0:37:32.069,000 --> 0:37:37,000
including identifying places that are

917
0:37:34.569,000 --> 0:37:38,000
getting over the you know the surge and

918
0:37:37.18,000 --> 0:37:4,000
are able to reallocate to other places

919
0:37:39.099,000 --> 0:37:42,000
where they're just entering their surge

920
0:37:40.719,000 --> 0:37:44,000
so that kind of centralized national

921
0:37:42.999,000 --> 0:37:45,000
coordinating role is something that

922
0:37:44.92,000 --> 0:37:48,000
we're really missing here

923
0:37:46.869,000 --> 0:37:49,000
and I think not only does it make it

924
0:37:49.119,000 --> 0:37:53,000
hard for all of us to get the resources

925
0:37:50.799,000 --> 0:37:53,000
we need but there's real equity issues

926
0:37:53.68,000 --> 0:37:55,000
here I

927
0:37:54.67,000 --> 0:37:57,000
worried all the time about who is

928
0:37:56.14,000 --> 0:37:59,000
getting the limited resources it's

929
0:37:58.12,000 --> 0:38:01,000
probably they're really enriched out

930
0:37:59.92,000 --> 0:38:02,000
systems that have a lot of political

931
0:38:01.75,000 --> 0:38:04,000
power in their communities and you know

932
0:38:03.85,000 --> 0:38:06,000
have already we're kind of well

933
0:38:05.53,000 --> 0:38:09,000
resourced going in they're likely to get

934
0:38:07.21,000 --> 0:38:11,000
more and smaller and less resource

935
0:38:09.58,000 --> 0:38:14,000
places are simply not going to get the

936
0:38:11.35,000 --> 0:38:16,000
attention the political will the the

937
0:38:14.71,000 --> 0:38:19,000
voice do to get what they need and that

938
0:38:17.08,000 --> 0:38:21,000
affects their their communities and so

939
0:38:19.9,000 --> 0:38:22,000
there's there's huge inequities that are

940
0:38:21.64,000 --> 0:38:25,000
going to be doubled down because we

941
0:38:23.53,000 --> 0:38:28,000
don't have a coordinated system that

942
0:38:26.11,000 --> 0:38:29,000
that has some you know some structure in

943
0:38:28.57,000 --> 0:38:33,000
place to make sure these decisions and

944
0:38:30.04,000 --> 0:38:35,000
resources are equitably made Helen has

945
0:38:34.48,000 --> 0:38:39,000
some got some more questions from online

946
0:38:35.74,000 --> 0:38:41,000
I do I have overweening love for you and

947
0:38:40.18,000 --> 0:38:45,000
gratitude but everything that you're

948
0:38:42.34,000 --> 0:38:48,000
doing and I have some questions too so

949
0:38:45.4,000 --> 0:38:51,000
one is someone has five and ninety five

950
0:38:49.3,000 --> 0:38:52,000
masks they want to donate them but

951
0:38:51.4,000 --> 0:38:55,000
they're not quite sure how to do that

952
0:38:52.84,000 --> 0:38:57,000
how how can how can they help how can

953
0:38:55.81,000 --> 0:38:59,000
they get those masks to you or to your

954
0:38:57.88,000 --> 0:39:03,000
colleagues thank you

955
0:39:00.58,000 --> 0:39:08,000
so most hospitals have listed drop-off

956
0:39:04.63,000 --> 0:39:11,000
locations for n95 and ours and actually

957
0:39:09.28,000 --> 0:39:13,000
have built methods for people to be able

958
0:39:11.77,000 --> 0:39:15,000
to drive by not get out of your car and

959
0:39:14.17,000 --> 0:39:17,000
risk yourself by coming into a health

960
0:39:16.33,000 --> 0:39:2,000
care center but to be able to do it on

961
0:39:17.8,000 --> 0:39:23,000
the outside with minimal contact and so

962
0:39:21.22,000 --> 0:39:26,000
I would encourage you to to either call

963
0:39:24.73,000 --> 0:39:28,000
your local hospital or health system

964
0:39:26.92,000 --> 0:39:3,000
almost everybody has a kovat hotline set

965
0:39:29.17,000 --> 0:39:33,000
up or the hospital operator can divert

966
0:39:31.63,000 --> 0:39:34,000
you to it also if you go on some of

967
0:39:34.06,000 --> 0:39:38,000
these coordinating websites the one I'm

968
0:39:35.56,000 --> 0:39:42,000
involved with is called get us PPE org

969
0:39:38.4,000 --> 0:39:45,000
we have by state a sorted list of

970
0:39:42.78,000 --> 0:39:47,000
hospitals that are accepting PPE

971
0:39:46,000 --> 0:39:5,000
donations including the address and

972
0:39:48.49,000 --> 0:39:51,000
hours of drop-off so you can go right

973
0:39:50.65,000 --> 0:39:54,000
there and hopefully find one that's

974
0:39:51.97,000 --> 0:39:57,000
close to you and then this is arguably a

975
0:39:55.54,000 --> 0:39:59,000
more personal question so apologies in

976
0:39:58,000 --> 0:40:03,000
advance but we've seen a really shocking

977
0:40:00.52,000 --> 0:40:06,000
rise in anti-asian discrimination

978
0:40:03.67,000 --> 0:40:07,000
through this and I just wonder what

979
0:40:07.06,000 --> 0:40:09,000
message you have for pew

980
0:40:08.2,000 --> 0:40:12,000
or who are turning inwards or who are

981
0:40:09.97,000 --> 0:40:15,000
allowing their fear and anger to turn

982
0:40:12.25,000 --> 0:40:2,000
outwards to another to another group if

983
0:40:16.57,000 --> 0:40:24,000
you have any words of wisdom on that

984
0:40:20.94,000 --> 0:40:26,000
yeah this is this is another one of

985
0:40:25.359,000 --> 0:40:28,000
those collateral damage pieces that is

986
0:40:27.369,000 --> 0:40:31,000
so disturbing with this virus I mean the

987
0:40:29.29,000 --> 0:40:34,000
virus from the minute we were aware of

988
0:40:31.63,000 --> 0:40:37,000
it came along with racism and hatred and

989
0:40:35.23,000 --> 0:40:4,000
I am a part of many Asian American

990
0:40:38.41,000 --> 0:40:42,000
communities and I mean the stories are

991
0:40:40.839,000 --> 0:40:44,000
not mine to tell but I will tell you

992
0:40:42.49,000 --> 0:40:47,000
that people have had very harrowing

993
0:40:45.49,000 --> 0:40:5,000
harrowing experiences directed at them

994
0:40:48.13,000 --> 0:40:53,000
and that their young children that are

995
0:40:50.77,000 --> 0:40:53,000
clearly linked to fear of kovat 19

996
0:40:53.14,000 --> 0:41:,000
because you know people will explicitly

997
0:40:54.73,000 --> 0:41:01,000
say things that that relate to the virus

998
0:41:00.369,000 --> 0:41:03,000
and and why they're people brought it

999
0:41:01.96,000 --> 0:41:06,000
into this country and it's a it's a

1000
0:41:04.3,000 --> 0:41:09,000
terrible time and I don't know what

1001
0:41:07.69,000 --> 0:41:1,000
advice I have except that we should all

1002
0:41:09.52,000 --> 0:41:12,000
be aware that it's happening I have a

1003
0:41:11.589,000 --> 0:41:13,000
number of friends who said I didn't see

1004
0:41:13.089,000 --> 0:41:17,000
it until you pointed it out and now it's

1005
0:41:14.56,000 --> 0:41:2,000
it's terribly obvious and so I think we

1006
0:41:17.8,000 --> 0:41:21,000
all I think just acknowledging it when

1007
0:41:21.43,000 --> 0:41:26,000
you see it even though you're not the

1008
0:41:22.69,000 --> 0:41:28,000
target of it being really explicit that

1009
0:41:26.74,000 --> 0:41:3,000
this is not acceptable right now I think

1010
0:41:29.47,000 --> 0:41:33,000
people being the best allies they can be

1011
0:41:31.42,000 --> 0:41:34,000
because very hard in the moment when

1012
0:41:33.91,000 --> 0:41:37,000
you're experiencing that kind of racism

1013
0:41:35.17,000 --> 0:41:39,000
to stand up for yourself or for your

1014
0:41:37.96,000 --> 0:41:4,000
family members so I think this is one of

1015
0:41:39.91,000 --> 0:41:42,000
those times where we really need people

1016
0:41:41.349,000 --> 0:41:47,000
to call it out and to tamp it down

1017
0:41:43.21,000 --> 0:41:5,000
quickly where they see it happening well

1018
0:41:47.53,000 --> 0:41:51,000
sit I mean it's at this point of

1019
0:41:50.53,000 --> 0:41:54,000
collateral damage I know that you've

1020
0:41:51.819,000 --> 0:41:57,000
also talked to about some of the other

1021
0:41:55,000 --> 0:42:,000
downstream medical effects that you've

1022
0:41:57.97,000 --> 0:42:,000
seen that are not even connected to

1023
0:42:00.369,000 --> 0:42:03,000
people contracted the virus at all you

1024
0:42:01.63,000 --> 0:42:05,000
know you've talked about domestic

1025
0:42:03.43,000 --> 0:42:06,000
violence and I'd love to hear you I

1026
0:42:05.65,000 --> 0:42:09,000
guess address that a little bit more

1027
0:42:07.27,000 --> 0:42:13,000
just what what are you seeing as it

1028
0:42:10.27,000 --> 0:42:15,000
relates to those sorts of issues yeah

1029
0:42:13.869,000 --> 0:42:18,000
this is one thing that's again been

1030
0:42:16.06,000 --> 0:42:21,000
traveling around my community my online

1031
0:42:19.39,000 --> 0:42:25,000
communities of physicians and nurse

1032
0:42:21.97,000 --> 0:42:26,000
is and this is only anecdotal now I

1033
0:42:25.54,000 --> 0:42:31,000
don't have the data but I think it will

1034
0:42:27.4,000 --> 0:42:36,000
come as we as we look back but when you

1035
0:42:31.75,000 --> 0:42:37,000
put people into their homes 24/7 and and

1036
0:42:36.49,000 --> 0:42:39,000
when you do that in a very economically

1037
0:42:38.38,000 --> 0:42:41,000
stressful time where people are losing

1038
0:42:40.359,000 --> 0:42:43,000
their jobs and feeling a lot of stress

1039
0:42:42.04,000 --> 0:42:46,000
about just getting meals on the table I

1040
0:42:43.93,000 --> 0:42:47,000
mean that is a setting in which in which

1041
0:42:46.45,000 --> 0:42:49,000
family violence child abuse into their

1042
0:42:48.67,000 --> 0:42:53,000
partner violence will increase and we're

1043
0:42:50.23,000 --> 0:42:56,000
seeing that in the hospital I mean I've

1044
0:42:53.71,000 --> 0:42:57,000
seen a number of cases where people fled

1045
0:42:56.77,000 --> 0:43:,000
to the hospital because their home was

1046
0:42:58.21,000 --> 0:43:03,000
simply not safe and became abruptly more

1047
0:43:01.42,000 --> 0:43:06,000
not safe because of stay at home orders

1048
0:43:04.2,000 --> 0:43:08,000
I've seen young children harmed because

1049
0:43:06.88,000 --> 0:43:11,000
in their regular lives they could escape

1050
0:43:09.19,000 --> 0:43:14,000
to school for a good chunk of the day or

1051
0:43:12.07,000 --> 0:43:17,000
they had these extended communities of

1052
0:43:15.09,000 --> 0:43:19,000
family members and friends floating

1053
0:43:17.32,000 --> 0:43:2,000
around and then stay at home orders went

1054
0:43:19.119,000 --> 0:43:22,000
to place and everybody retreated into

1055
0:43:20.56,000 --> 0:43:24,000
their homes and there was no that

1056
0:43:22.72,000 --> 0:43:25,000
barrier that always was the difference

1057
0:43:24.64,000 --> 0:43:28,000
between safety and harm was suddenly

1058
0:43:26.589,000 --> 0:43:32,000
removed and family violence went up and

1059
0:43:29.349,000 --> 0:43:34,000
and truly I mean I am a violence

1060
0:43:32.619,000 --> 0:43:36,000
researcher I'm always very attuned to

1061
0:43:35.2,000 --> 0:43:39,000
the patients who come in who are

1062
0:43:36.79,000 --> 0:43:41,000
experiencing violence and I have never

1063
0:43:39.28,000 --> 0:43:44,000
seen anything like this before and and I

1064
0:43:42.64,000 --> 0:43:47,000
think you will never attach a cope of 19

1065
0:43:45.04,000 --> 0:43:5,000
diagnosis to this know no review of

1066
0:43:48.22,000 --> 0:43:52,000
medical records may really may really

1067
0:43:50.71,000 --> 0:43:55,000
attach this to cope in nineteen but I

1068
0:43:52.359,000 --> 0:43:57,000
consider this a very a very sad part of

1069
0:43:56.44,000 --> 0:44:,000
the collateral damage that's happening

1070
0:43:58.27,000 --> 0:44:01,000
directly because of this disease

1071
0:44:02.08,000 --> 0:44:06,000
and you know as we wrap up here I think

1072
0:44:04.57,000 --> 0:44:07,000
I'm sure that this is something that a

1073
0:44:06.609,000 --> 0:44:08,000
lot of folks out there are thinking

1074
0:44:07.69,000 --> 0:44:11,000
about too is just you know what is I

1075
0:44:09.33,000 --> 0:44:14,000
guess the the big takeaway what are the

1076
0:44:12.31,000 --> 0:44:17,000
the big things that we should know that

1077
0:44:14.589,000 --> 0:44:19,000
we should do the ensure that we can get

1078
0:44:17.44,000 --> 0:44:23,000
to what is whatever the best case

1079
0:44:19.96,000 --> 0:44:26,000
scenario is at this point yeah well I

1080
0:44:23.589,000 --> 0:44:3,000
would say to to give people a measure of

1081
0:44:27.49,000 --> 0:44:32,000
hope and optimism your little actions

1082
0:44:31,000 --> 0:44:35,000
are working so I know there's nothing

1083
0:44:33.369,000 --> 0:44:38,000
glamorous about do nothing and

1084
0:44:35.43,000 --> 0:44:4,000
at home and I am so acutely aware of how

1085
0:44:39.359,000 --> 0:44:43,000
much people are sacrificing I mean

1086
0:44:41.4,000 --> 0:44:45,000
people are they're sacrificing their

1087
0:44:43.5,000 --> 0:44:48,000
businesses their livelihood people who

1088
0:44:46.109,000 --> 0:44:51,000
are just on the edge of being a feeling

1089
0:44:49.319,000 --> 0:44:54,000
financially secure are just giving it

1090
0:44:51.569,000 --> 0:44:55,000
all up to stay at home you couldn't ask

1091
0:44:54.329,000 --> 0:44:57,000
for a bigger sacrifice and yet those

1092
0:44:56.16,000 --> 0:45:,000
things are working look at what's

1093
0:44:57.839,000 --> 0:45:01,000
happening in Ohio in Oregon in other

1094
0:45:00.599,000 --> 0:45:04,000
states where we're really able to get

1095
0:45:02.25,000 --> 0:45:06,000
ahead of this we are protecting

1096
0:45:04.65,000 --> 0:45:08,000
ourselves our family members and also

1097
0:45:06.78,000 --> 0:45:1,000
importantly our really vulnerable

1098
0:45:08.76,000 --> 0:45:13,000
members of society are our older

1099
0:45:10.829,000 --> 0:45:16,000
citizens by doing these things and doing

1100
0:45:14.369,000 --> 0:45:18,000
that sacrifice so I think while we're

1101
0:45:17.64,000 --> 0:45:21,000
going through some really really tough

1102
0:45:19.349,000 --> 0:45:24,000
times in these hardest hit cities what

1103
0:45:22.589,000 --> 0:45:26,000
we're what everyday people are doing in

1104
0:45:25.17,000 --> 0:45:28,000
response is really working so I think it

1105
0:45:27.3,000 --> 0:45:3,000
can feel futile I think sometimes to

1106
0:45:29.099,000 --> 0:45:34,000
just kind of sit quietly and do your

1107
0:45:30.71,000 --> 0:45:35,000
social distancing thing and nobody you

1108
0:45:34.65,000 --> 0:45:37,000
know there's no glory in that and it's

1109
0:45:36.42,000 --> 0:45:4,000
also can be incredibly boring I'm

1110
0:45:38.13,000 --> 0:45:42,000
learning looking online and seeing how

1111
0:45:40.74,000 --> 0:45:45,000
creative people are getting with their

1112
0:45:42.15,000 --> 0:45:49,000
dance moves and their bread recipes but

1113
0:45:45.9,000 --> 0:45:5,000
it really is also heroic work and it is

1114
0:45:49.29,000 --> 0:45:54,000
saving lives for sure so thank you to

1115
0:45:51.18,000 --> 0:45:58,000
everybody for for that simple act it's

1116
0:45:54.45,000 --> 0:46:02,000
making everything better well thank you

1117
0:45:58.619,000 --> 0:46:05,000
dr. chu I think I speak for everyone and

1118
0:46:03.27,000 --> 0:46:07,000
how how much we appreciate you coming

1119
0:46:05.76,000 --> 0:46:09,000
spending time with us today

1120
0:46:07.5,000 --> 0:46:12,000
sharing your experiences and your wisdom

1121
0:46:10.29,000 --> 0:46:15,000
and knowledge Helen did you have any

1122
0:46:13.22,000 --> 0:46:18,000
last things that you wanted to share

1123
0:46:16.28,000 --> 0:46:2,000
only that it's kind of you to try and

1124
0:46:18.66,000 --> 0:46:23,000
deflect but we all know who the heroes

1125
0:46:20.79,000 --> 0:46:25,000

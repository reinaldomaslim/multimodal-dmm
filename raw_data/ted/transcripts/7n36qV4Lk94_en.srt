1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So he starts out with one line, and then two,

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and then four, and then 16, and so on.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
he ends up with an infinite number of lines,

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
each of which has an infinite number of points in it.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And when he came out of the sanitarium,

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.

15
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
He was a very religious man.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He was a mathematician on a mission.

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;

22
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we can use any seed shape we like.

23
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK --

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.

25
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So these all have the property of self-similarity:

26
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the part looks like the whole.

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's the same pattern at many different scales.

28
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange

29
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.

30
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,

31
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.

32
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This made no sense at all,

33
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.

34
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.

35
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And that worked for a hundred years.

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,

38
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,

39
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you get the shapes of nature.

40
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,

41
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you get these beautiful natural forms.

42
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet --

43
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
go ahead and do that now --

44
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,

45
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Your body is covered with fractals.

47
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?

48
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.

49
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.

50
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.

51
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.

52
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So nature has this self-similar structure.

53
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Nature uses self-organizing systems.

54
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice

55
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.

56
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"

57
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.

58
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year

59
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
asking people why they were building fractals,

60
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is a great job if you can get it.

61
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city

63
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
just to see how it would sort of unfold --

64
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,

65
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and my French is not very good; I said something like,

66
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."

67
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,

68
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we talked about fractals.

69
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,

70
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we know all about that."

71
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,

72
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.

73
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.

74
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.

76
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is a village in southern Zambia.

77
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.

78
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You have a huge ring.

79
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,

80
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back

81
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.

82
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So here's a little fractal model for it.

83
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Here's one house with the sacred altar,

84
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,

85
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,

86
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and then here's the village as a whole --

87
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,

88
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and here there's a tiny village only this big.

89
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?

90
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.

91
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?

92
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.

93
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.

94
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,

95
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"

96
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.

97
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I came up with this structure here.

98
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.

99
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now, after I did the simulation,

100
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,

101
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.

102
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.

103
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, when I got to the village,

104
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I said, "Can you take me to the square building?

105
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I think something's going on there."

106
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside

107
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year

108
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields."

109
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility

110
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.

111
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.

112
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So here's a Nankani village in Mali.

113
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --

114
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.

115
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,

116
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they're stacked recursively.

117
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.

118
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And when she dies, they have a ceremony

119
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.

120
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Once again, infinity is important.

121
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.

122
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?

123
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And that was actually my original hypothesis.

124
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
When I first saw those African fractals,

125
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,

126
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."

127
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But that turns out not to be true.

128
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;

129
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
only the African ones were fractal.

130
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.

131
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.

132
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You can see on the pottery and the baskets.

133
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;

134
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?

135
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It is not the same pattern at two different scales.

136
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Second, you might ask,

137
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"

138
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And three times, the answer is no.

139
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
First of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"

140
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,

141
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and then oppositional movements.

142
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
No, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture --

143
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and it definitely is not "in the DNA."

144
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity --

145
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other --

146
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you see very different uses for fractals.

147
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's a shared technology in Africa.

148
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?

149
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's not really mathematical knowledge.

150
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?

151
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.

152
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.

153
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar

154
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
asking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"

155
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and they'd say,

156
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)

157
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But sometimes, that's not the case.

158
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.

159
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.

160
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.

161
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,

162
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;

163
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we now call it an Eulerian path --

164
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you can never lift your stylus from the surface

165
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and you can never go over the same line twice.

166
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,

167
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,

168
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.

169
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And with each iteration of that algorithm,

170
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you learn the iterations of the myth.

171
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You learn the next level of knowledge.

172
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.

173
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;

174
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.

175
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Well, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.

176
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns

177
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and would use them strategically.

178
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So this is very conscious knowledge.

179
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Here's a wonderful fractal.

180
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.

181
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.

182
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.

183
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,

184
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,

185
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."

186
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And his answer was very interesting.

187
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw

188
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because they're very quick and they're very cheap.

189
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw."

190
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
He said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.

191
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.

192
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."

193
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"Now," he said, "we know from experience

194
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."

195
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.

196
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And I measured out the lengths of straw,

197
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,

198
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height

199
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in the wind engineering handbook.

200
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.

201
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found

202
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,

203
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and this was Bamana sand divination.

204
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.

205
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,

206
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and often the symbols are very well preserved,

207
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --

208
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,

209
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,

210
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.

211
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And they did this very rapidly,

212
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and I couldn't understand where they were getting --

213
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they only did the randomness four times --

214
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.

215
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And they wouldn't tell me.

216
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."

217
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,

218
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and I'll come each day and pay you."

219
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."

220
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And finally, out of desperation, I said,

221
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."

222
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,

223
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.

224
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
And one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."

225
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.

226
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And of course, I was only interested in the math,

227
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,

228
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"You know, I didn't learn it this way."

229
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,

230
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.

231
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.

232
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.

233
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.

234
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So even plus odd gives you odd.

235
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Odd plus even gives you odd.

236
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.

237
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.

238
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in

239
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.

240
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.

241
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Now, because it's a binary code,

242
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you can actually implement this in hardware --

243
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.

244
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.

245
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.

246
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:

247
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
divination through the earth.

248
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.

249
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Leibniz, the German mathematician,

250
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."

251
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,

252
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."

253
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.

254
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,

255
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.

256
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So all these little PDAs and laptops --

257
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa.

258
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,

259
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.

260
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

261
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.

262
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And you can go to our website,

263
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the applets are all free; they just run in the browser.

264
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Anybody in the world can use them.

265
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program

266
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,

267
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web

268
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.

269
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.

270
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class

271
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in comparison with a control group that did not have the software.

272
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,

273
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that it's not just about singing and dancing.

274
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.

275
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;

276
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.

277
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We've also been working in design.

278
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea

279
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,

280
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,

281
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it doesn't quite fit.

282
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.

283
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture

284
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in which he's used some of these fractal structures.

285
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,

286
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.

287
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.

288
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Actually, the reason that Google was such a success

289
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.

290
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's in ecological sustainability.

291
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,

292
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
the ethical power of democracy.

293
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It's also in some bad things.

294
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.

295
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,

296
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
you haven't opened your eyes enough.

297
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,

298
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the traditional African methods for doing self-organization.

299
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
These are robust algorithms.

300
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship --

301
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that are gentle, that are egalitarian.

302
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,

303
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.

304
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:13.8,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself

2
0:00:17.36,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that are hospitable to humans by any measure,

3
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but survive we have.

4
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered,

5
0:00:28.079,000 --> 0:00:31,000
they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories

6
0:00:31.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in search of better opportunities.

7
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And as the descendants of these explorers,

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.

9
0:00:40.04,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But at the same time,

10
0:00:41.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
distracted by our bread and circuses

11
0:00:43.64,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other,

12
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.

13
0:00:52.32,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely

14
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:01:,000
for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,

15
0:01:01.68,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and so content are we with our living conditions

16
0:01:04.84,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that we have grown complacent and just too busy

17
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to notice that its resources are finite,

18
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and that our Sun's life is also finite.

19
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:16,000
While Mars and all the movies made in its name

20
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:2,000
have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel,

21
0:01:20.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution

22
0:01:25.64,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.

23
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Let us take a trek to your local national forest

24
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for a quick reality check.

25
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So just a quick show of hands here:

26
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness

27
0:01:39.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for a few days?

28
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, that's a lot of you.

29
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How about a few weeks?

30
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That's a decent amount.

31
0:01:47.28,000 --> 0:01:48,000
How about a few months?

32
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That's pretty good too.

33
0:01:51.12,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, let us imagine that this local national forest

34
0:01:53.8,000 --> 0:01:55,000
experiences an eternal winter.

35
0:01:57.36,000 --> 0:02:,000
Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?

36
0:02:02.28,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's quite a lot.

37
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
How about a few weeks?

38
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available

39
0:02:11.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.

40
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found,

41
0:02:19.2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.

42
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face

43
0:02:29.4,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on a planet like Mars.

44
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed

45
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from a tropical vacation?

46
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?

47
0:02:42.88,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts

48
0:02:46.36,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that tether your planet of choice to our home planet?

49
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?

50
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

51
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun,

52
0:03:03.72,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we are more likely than not going to be spending much time

53
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in the journey itself,

54
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in space,

55
0:03:11.48,000 --> 0:03:13,000
on a ship, a hermetic flying can,

56
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
possibly for many generations.

57
0:03:17.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space

58
0:03:20.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.

59
0:03:24.6,000 --> 0:03:26,000
From astronauts' experiences in space,

60
0:03:26.96,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we know that spending time in a microgravity environment

61
0:03:30.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems,

62
0:03:35.36,000 --> 0:03:36,000
among many other complications

63
0:03:36.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that range for the physiological to the psychological.

64
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And what about macrogravity,

65
0:03:42.64,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or any other variation in gravitational pull

66
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the planet that we find ourselves on?

67
0:03:48.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers

68
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
both known and unknown.

69
0:03:54.96,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology

70
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or that great next generation robot

71
0:04:01.28,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.

72
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come

73
0:04:08.56,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for us to complement these bulky electronic giants

74
0:04:12.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with what nature has already invented:

75
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the microbe,

76
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing,

77
0:04:22.96,000 --> 0:04:23,000
living machine.

78
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It requires fairly little to maintain,

79
0:04:27.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
offers much flexibility in design

80
0:04:29.12,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.

81
0:04:33.399,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe

82
0:04:37.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is known as synthetic biology.

83
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines

84
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and better ways to observe the physiological nuances

85
0:04:46.88,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of the human body.

86
0:04:48.52,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

87
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism,

88
0:04:53.48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
microscopic or not,

89
0:04:55.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with incredible speed and fidelity.

90
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
Given the limitations of our man-made machines,

91
0:05:01.68,000 --> 0:05:04,000
synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food,

92
0:05:05.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
our fuel and our environment,

93
0:05:08.44,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but also ourselves

94
0:05:10.76,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to compensate for our physical inadequacies

95
0:05:13.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and to ensure our survival in space.

96
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
To give you an example

97
0:05:18.24,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration,

98
0:05:21.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
let us return to the Mars environment.

99
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,

100
0:05:28.92,000 --> 0:05:29,000
with trace amounts of organic material.

101
0:05:31.4,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Let's say, hypothetically,

102
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:35,000
what if martian soil could actually support plant growth

103
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:37,000
without using Earth-derived nutrients?

104
0:05:39.36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The first question we should probably ask is,

105
0:05:41.48,000 --> 0:05:43,000
how would we make our plants cold-tolerant?

106
0:05:43.88,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Because, on average, the temperature on Mars

107
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.

108
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The next question we should ask is,

109
0:05:51.8,000 --> 0:05:53,000
how do we make our plants drought-tolerant?

110
0:05:54.28,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Considering that most of the water that forms as frost

111
0:05:57.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
evaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate."

112
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.

113
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:07,000
By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish

114
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice

115
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and then stitching them into the plants that need them,

116
0:06:13.72,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.

117
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They're known on Earth as GMOs,

118
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
or genetically modified organisms,

119
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.

120
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Nature does stuff like this already,

121
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
without our help.

122
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We have simply found more precise ways to do it.

123
0:06:37.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?

124
0:06:42.12,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer

125
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
endless acres of land on an entirely new planet

126
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses

127
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.

128
0:06:56.48,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise

129
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.

130
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
One of the best ways to ensure

131
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need

132
0:07:07.84,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered

133
0:07:10.96,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to adapt to new and harsh environments.

134
0:07:14.76,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet

135
0:07:18.76,000 --> 0:07:2,000
both in the short and long term.

136
0:07:22.4,000 --> 0:07:26,000
These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.

137
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us,

138
0:07:31.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but what else can we do?

139
0:07:33.88,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species,

140
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.

141
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes

142
0:07:42.44,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that you were sitting here and I was standing there.

143
0:07:45.48,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute,

144
0:07:49.2,000 --> 0:07:52,000
even given ample food, water, air

145
0:07:52.72,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and a suit,

146
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems

147
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:08:,000
from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface

148
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.

149
0:08:05.28,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Unless we plan to stay holed up underground

150
0:08:07.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
for the duration of our stay on every new planet,

151
0:08:10.48,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we must find better ways of protecting ourselves

152
0:08:13.08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor

153
0:08:15.76,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that weighs something equal to your own body weight,

154
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.

155
0:08:22.24,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So let us appeal to nature for inspiration.

156
0:08:26.2,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Among the plethora of life here on Earth,

157
0:08:28.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles,

158
0:08:31.2,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or lovers of extreme living conditions,

159
0:08:33.2,000 --> 0:08:35,000
if you'll remember from high school biology.

160
0:08:35.68,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.

161
0:08:41.04,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid,

162
0:08:46.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and, most notably, radiation.

163
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known,

164
0:08:52.159,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.

165
0:08:55.52,000 --> 0:08:57,000
To do so is not particularly easy.

166
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance,

167
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and it's not as simple as transferring one gene.

168
0:09:03.96,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But given a little bit of human ingenuity

169
0:09:07.24,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and a little bit of time,

170
0:09:08.52,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I think to do so is not very hard either.

171
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation,

172
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
it would be infinitely better than what we already have,

173
0:09:21.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
which is just the melanin in our skin.

174
0:09:24.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

175
0:09:26.6,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability

176
0:09:29.64,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.

177
0:09:35.76,000 --> 0:09:36,000
As difficult as it is to see,

178
0:09:37.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
homo sapiens, that is humans,

179
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
evolves every day,

180
0:09:43.52,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and still continues to evolve.

181
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Thousands of years of human evolution

182
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
has not only given us humans like Tibetans,

183
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,

184
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,

185
0:09:58.72,000 --> 0:10:,000
the chemical element that can kill the average human being.

186
0:10:02.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations

187
0:10:06.08,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that equally accidentally allow certain humans

188
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to persevere in dismal situations.

189
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But, and this is a big but,

190
0:10:15.48,000 --> 0:10:19,000
such evolution requires two things that we may not always have,

191
0:10:19.68,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or be able to afford,

192
0:10:22.12,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and they are death and time.

193
0:10:25.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe,

194
0:10:28.6,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we may not always have the time necessary

195
0:10:31.08,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for the natural evolution of extra functions

196
0:10:33.64,000 --> 0:10:35,000
for survival on non-Earth planets.

197
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention,

198
0:10:40.88,000 --> 0:10:45,000
during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy

199
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
with temporary external supplements.

200
0:10:49.96,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But with every passing day,

201
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we approach the age of volitional evolution,

202
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
a time during which we as a species

203
0:10:56.72,000 --> 0:11:,000
will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.

204
0:11:02.72,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Augmenting the human body with new abilities

205
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is no longer a question of how,

206
0:11:07.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but of when.

207
0:11:10.24,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Using synthetic biology

208
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms,

209
0:11:14.64,000 --> 0:11:15,000
especially our own,

210
0:11:15.88,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is not without its moral and ethical quandaries.

211
0:11:19.28,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Will engineering ourselves make us less human?

212
0:11:22.96,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But then again, what is humanity

213
0:11:25.24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but star stuff that happens to be conscious?

214
0:11:29.2,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Where should human genius direct itself?

215
0:11:32.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.

216
0:11:37.8,000 --> 0:11:38,000
How do we use our knowledge

217
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to protect ourselves from the external dangers

218
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and then protect ourselves from ourselves?

219
0:11:46.4,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I pose these questions

220
0:11:47.84,000 --> 0:11:49,000
not to engender the fear of science

221
0:11:50.04,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but to bring to light the many possibilities

222
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that science has afforded and continues to afford us.

223
0:11:56.76,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions

224
0:12:00.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
not only with caution

225
0:12:02.64,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but also with courage.

226
0:12:06.2,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Mars is a destination,

227
0:12:10.44,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but it will not be our last.

228
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Our true final frontier is the line we must cross

229
0:12:15.88,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.

230
0:12:21.88,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.

231
0:12:27.12,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Our path to the stars will be rife with trials

232
0:12:29.56,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that will bring us to question not only who we are

233
0:12:32.56,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but where we will be going.

234
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology

235
0:12:38.76,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that we have gleaned from life itself,

236
0:12:40.88,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.

237
0:12:44.76,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Thank you.

238
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:5,000

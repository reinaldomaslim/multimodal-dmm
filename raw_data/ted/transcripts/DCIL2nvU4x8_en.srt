1
0:00:13.202,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Scientific breakthrough,

2
0:00:14.711,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the kind that can potentially save lives,

3
0:00:17.324,000 --> 0:00:19,000
can sometimes be lying right out in the open

4
0:00:19.388,000 --> 0:00:2,000
for us to discover,

5
0:00:20.95,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in the evolved, accumulated body

6
0:00:23.156,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of human anecdote, for example,

7
0:00:25.748,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or in the time-tested adaptations

8
0:00:27.774,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that we observe in the natural world around us.

9
0:00:31.236,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Science starts with observation,

10
0:00:33.856,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures

11
0:00:37.252,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that we might otherwise dismiss

12
0:00:39.197,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as myth or coincidence,

13
0:00:41.064,000 --> 0:00:44,000
isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.

14
0:00:44.917,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And when we do, the results will often surprise.

15
0:00:48.975,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Western Australia has had a particular problem

16
0:00:50.855,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with shark attacks over the last three years,

17
0:00:54.07,000 --> 0:00:56,000
unfortunately and tragically culminating

18
0:00:56.251,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period

19
0:00:59.331,000 --> 0:01:,000
during that time.

20
0:01:01.091,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But Western Australia is not alone in this.

21
0:01:03.22,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The incident of shark engagements on humans

22
0:01:06.125,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is escalating worldwide.

23
0:01:08.469,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so it's not surprising, perhaps,

24
0:01:10.213,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that in July of this year,

25
0:01:11.856,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration

26
0:01:14.335,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute

27
0:01:17.399,000 --> 0:01:19,000
made an announcement which captured the attention

28
0:01:20.173,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of the worldwide media and of ocean users

29
0:01:22.409,000 --> 0:01:23,000
worldwide,

30
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and that was around the development of technology

31
0:01:25.931,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack

32
0:01:28.572,000 --> 0:01:31,000
based on the science of what sharks can see.

33
0:01:31.72,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I have for you today

34
0:01:33.309,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the story of that journey,

35
0:01:35.176,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but also the notion that science can be

36
0:01:37.516,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as powerful as a translator

37
0:01:39.981,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as it can be for invention.

38
0:01:43.34,000 --> 0:01:44,000
When we began this process,

39
0:01:45.046,000 --> 0:01:48,000
we were looking, it was about three years ago,

40
0:01:48.228,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks

41
0:01:51.65,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in Western Australia,

42
0:01:53.421,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and by chance, in a previous role,

43
0:01:55.628,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.

44
0:01:58.551,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now Harry Butler, who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist,

45
0:02:02.258,000 --> 0:02:04,000
had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.

46
0:02:04.593,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,

47
0:02:06.699,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to the late Steve Irwin.

48
0:02:08.61,000 --> 0:02:09,000
When I asked him about

49
0:02:09.921,000 --> 0:02:12,000
what the solution to the problem might be,

50
0:02:13.219,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the answer was quite surprising.

51
0:02:14.731,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He said, "Take a black wetsuit,

52
0:02:16.606,000 --> 0:02:18,000
band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,

53
0:02:19.371,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you'll be mimicking the warning systems

54
0:02:21.659,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of most marine species."

55
0:02:23.968,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I didn't think about that much at the time,

56
0:02:25.866,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened,

57
0:02:29.456,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it caused me to think,

58
0:02:30.89,000 --> 0:02:32,000
maybe there's some merit to this idea.

59
0:02:33.021,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I turned to the web

60
0:02:34.486,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to see if there might be some clues.

61
0:02:36.741,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And it turns out the web is awash

62
0:02:39.018,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with this sort of evidence that supports

63
0:02:41.414,000 --> 0:02:42,000
this sort of thinking.

64
0:02:42.976,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So biologically, there are plenty of species

65
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,

66
0:02:47.556,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to either be cryptical in the water

67
0:02:49.258,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or warn against being attacked,

68
0:02:51.842,000 --> 0:02:53,000
not the least of which is the pilot fish

69
0:02:53.955,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which spends a big slab of its life

70
0:02:56.111,000 --> 0:02:58,000
around the business end of a shark.

71
0:02:58.39,000 --> 0:03:01,000
On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,

72
0:03:01.481,000 --> 0:03:03,000
has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,

73
0:03:04.343,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and anthropologically,

74
0:03:05.965,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands

75
0:03:09.595,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in a sea snake ceremony

76
0:03:11.376,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to ward off the shark god.

77
0:03:13.97,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So what's going on here?

78
0:03:15.412,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Is this an idea lying wide out in the open

79
0:03:18.29,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for us to consider and define?

80
0:03:21.421,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We know that sharks use a range of sensors

81
0:03:25.79,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when they engage, particularly for attack,

82
0:03:29.162,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but the sight sensor is the one that they use

83
0:03:31.122,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to identify the target, and particularly

84
0:03:32.686,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the last number of meters before the attack.

85
0:03:36.42,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote

86
0:03:39.378,000 --> 0:03:4,000
because that's time-tested evolution

87
0:03:41.23,000 --> 0:03:43,000
over many millennia.

88
0:03:43.703,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,

89
0:03:47.18,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the idea that there's a kernel of truth

90
0:03:48.911,000 --> 0:03:49,000
thought to be important,

91
0:03:50.503,000 --> 0:03:53,000
passed down from generation to generation,

92
0:03:53.788,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?

93
0:03:57.103,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I wanted to test this idea.

94
0:03:58.763,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I wanted to put some science

95
0:03:59.981,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to this anecdotal evidence,

96
0:04:02.317,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because if science could support this concept,

97
0:04:04.273,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then we might have at least part of the solution

98
0:04:06.368,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to shark attack right under our very nose.

99
0:04:09.426,000 --> 0:04:1,000
To do that, I needed some experts

100
0:04:11.221,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in shark vision and shark neurology,

101
0:04:13.074,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and a worldwide search, again,

102
0:04:14.883,000 --> 0:04:15,000
led to the University of W.A.

103
0:04:16.322,000 --> 0:04:18,000
on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.

104
0:04:18.725,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And professor Nathan Hart and his team

105
0:04:21.322,000 --> 0:04:23,000
had just written a paper which tells us,

106
0:04:23.982,000 --> 0:04:25,000
confirms that predatory sharks see

107
0:04:26.334,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in black and white, or grayscale.

108
0:04:29.197,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I called up Nathan,

109
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea

110
0:04:32.866,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes

111
0:04:34.747,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack,

112
0:04:38.253,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.

113
0:04:40.425,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research

114
0:04:42.887,000 --> 0:04:44,000
supported by the West Australian State Government.

115
0:04:45.511,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we did three key things.

116
0:04:48.07,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The first is that we mapped the characteristics,

117
0:04:50.79,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the physical characteristics of the eyes

118
0:04:52.81,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of the three main predatory sharks,

119
0:04:54.748,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so the great white, tiger and bull shark.

120
0:04:58.466,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We did that genetically

121
0:05:00.02,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we did that anatomically.

122
0:05:02.92,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The next thing we did was to understand,

123
0:05:04.762,000 --> 0:05:05,000
using complex computer modeling,

124
0:05:06.197,000 --> 0:05:08,000
what that eye can see

125
0:05:08.251,000 --> 0:05:09,000
at different depths, distances,

126
0:05:10.02,000 --> 0:05:14,000
light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.

127
0:05:14.261,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And from there, we were able to pinpoint

128
0:05:15.451,000 --> 0:05:16,000
two key characteristics:

129
0:05:17.251,000 --> 0:05:2,000
what patterns and shapes would present the wearer

130
0:05:20.284,000 --> 0:05:23,000
as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,

131
0:05:23.516,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and what patterns and shapes might provide

132
0:05:25.012,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the greatest contrast but provide the greatest

133
0:05:27.933,000 --> 0:05:28,000
breakup of profile

134
0:05:29.39,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey

135
0:05:33.034,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or shark food.

136
0:05:35.387,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The next thing we needed to do was to convert this

137
0:05:37.579,000 --> 0:05:39,000
into wetsuits that people might actually wear,

138
0:05:40.328,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,

139
0:05:42.95,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,

140
0:05:46.18,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo,

141
0:05:48.542,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to come over and sit with the science team

142
0:05:50.827,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and interpret that science

143
0:05:54.423,000 --> 0:05:57,000
into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear.

144
0:05:57.565,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And here's an example of one of the first drawings.

145
0:06:00.021,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.

146
0:06:03.025,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So this takes that banding idea,

147
0:06:07.294,000 --> 0:06:09,000
takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,

148
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:11,000
provides a highly disruptive profile,

149
0:06:11.885,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and is intended to prevent the shark

150
0:06:13.712,000 --> 0:06:15,000
from considering that you would be ordinary food,

151
0:06:16.38,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and potentially even create confusion for the shark.

152
0:06:19.726,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.

153
0:06:23.501,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,

154
0:06:26.114,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and it's particularly better for the surface,

155
0:06:28.841,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where being backlit and providing a silhouette

156
0:06:31.689,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is problematic.

157
0:06:33.301,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,

158
0:06:36.209,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or the one which attempts to hide the wearer

159
0:06:37.82,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the water column.

160
0:06:39.31,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There are three panels on this suit,

161
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and in any given conditions,

162
0:06:42.624,000 --> 0:06:43,000
one or more of those panels

163
0:06:43.979,000 --> 0:06:45,000
will match the reflective spectra of the water

164
0:06:46.569,000 --> 0:06:48,000
so as to disappear fully or partially,

165
0:06:49.168,000 --> 0:06:51,000
leaving the last panel or panels

166
0:06:51.36,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to create a disruptive profile in the water column.

167
0:06:54.247,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And this one's particularly well-suited

168
0:06:56.412,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to the dive configuration,

169
0:06:58.859,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so when you're deeper under the water.

170
0:07:01.927,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So we knew that we had

171
0:07:03.637,000 --> 0:07:04,000
some really solid science here.

172
0:07:05.407,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We knew, if you wanted to stand out,

173
0:07:07.033,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you needed to look stripy,

174
0:07:08.205,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,

175
0:07:09.629,000 --> 0:07:1,000
you needed to look like this.

176
0:07:11.181,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But the acid test is always going to be,

177
0:07:13.007,000 --> 0:07:14,000
how would sharks really behave

178
0:07:14.339,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in the context of these patterns and shapes.

179
0:07:17.07,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit

180
0:07:20.381,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the water with a predatory shark

181
0:07:21.929,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in a natural environment

182
0:07:23.295,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is actually a lot harder than you might think.

183
0:07:25.247,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:28.598,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So we have to bait the rig,

185
0:07:31.164,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because we need to get the statistical number

186
0:07:32.708,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of samples through to get the scientific evidence,

187
0:07:35.732,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and by baiting the rig,

188
0:07:36.521,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we're obviously changing shark behavior.

189
0:07:38.75,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We can't put humans in the water.

190
0:07:40.567,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We're ethically precluded from even using

191
0:07:43.453,000 --> 0:07:45,000
humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.

192
0:07:46.1,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But nevertheless, we started the testing process

193
0:07:48.372,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in January of this year,

194
0:07:50.22,000 --> 0:07:51,000
initially with tiger sharks

195
0:07:51.356,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and subsequently with great white sharks.

196
0:07:54.695,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The way we did that

197
0:07:56.13,000 --> 0:08:,000
was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,

198
0:08:00.885,000 --> 0:08:01,000
wrap it in a neoprene skin,

199
0:08:02.781,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and then run two stereo underwater cameras

200
0:08:05.344,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig.

201
0:08:08.693,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And because we use stereo,

202
0:08:10.381,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is,

203
0:08:13.173,000 --> 0:08:15,000
what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,

204
0:08:15.429,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and what its behavior is

205
0:08:17.285,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in an empirical rather than a subjective way.

206
0:08:20.491,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Because we needed to preserve the scientific method,

207
0:08:22.979,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we ran a control rig

208
0:08:24.677,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which was a black neoprene rig

209
0:08:28.389,000 --> 0:08:29,000
just like a normal black wetsuit

210
0:08:30.198,000 --> 0:08:31,000
against the, what we call,

211
0:08:31.677,000 --> 0:08:33,000
SAMS technology rig.

212
0:08:33.805,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And the results were not just exciting,

213
0:08:36.533,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but very encouraging,

214
0:08:37.971,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and today I would like to just give you a snapshot

215
0:08:40.519,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of two of those engagements.

216
0:08:44.181,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark

217
0:08:46.301,000 --> 0:08:49,000
engaging the black control rig,

218
0:08:49.388,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which it had encountered about

219
0:08:50.729,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a minute and a half before.

220
0:09:11.78,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now that exact same shark had engaged,

221
0:09:14.21,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or encountered this SAMS rig,

222
0:09:16.04,000 --> 0:09:17,000
which is the Elude SAMS rig,

223
0:09:17.652,000 --> 0:09:18,000
about eight minutes before,

224
0:09:18.831,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,

225
0:09:21.974,000 --> 0:09:23,000
looking for what it could smell and sense but not see,

226
0:09:24.779,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and this was the final engagement.

227
0:09:29.734,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers,

228
0:09:32.687,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and here you see great white shark

229
0:09:34.735,000 --> 0:09:35,000
engaging a control rig,

230
0:09:36.142,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so a black neoprene wetsuit,

231
0:09:37.975,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and going straight to the bottom,

232
0:09:39.559,000 --> 0:09:41,000
coming up

233
0:09:42.11,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and engaging.

234
0:09:46.257,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,

235
0:09:48.94,000 --> 0:09:49,000
this is the banded one,

236
0:09:50.409,000 --> 0:09:51,000
where it's more tactile,

237
0:09:52.35,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's more investigative,

238
0:09:53.86,000 --> 0:09:54,000
it's more apprehensive,

239
0:09:55.494,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.

240
0:10:08.297,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

241
0:10:18.601,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So, it's important for us that all the testing is done independently,

242
0:10:22.877,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.

243
0:10:25.195,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It'll be an ongoing process.

244
0:10:26.947,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.

245
0:10:29.356,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's so important that this concept

246
0:10:31.699,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is led with the science.

247
0:10:33.497,000 --> 0:10:35,000
From the perspective of Shark Attack Mitigation Systems,

248
0:10:35.741,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we're a biotechnology licensing company,

249
0:10:38.146,000 --> 0:10:4,000
so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.

250
0:10:40.433,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We'll license others to do that.

251
0:10:42.713,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But I thought you might be interested

252
0:10:43.672,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in seeing what SAMS technology looks like

253
0:10:45.673,000 --> 0:10:47,000
embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,

254
0:10:48.672,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for the first time, live, worldwide --

255
0:10:51.888,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter) —

256
0:10:53.862,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I can show you what biological adaptation,

257
0:10:56.758,000 --> 0:10:59,000
science and design looks like in real life.

258
0:11:00.285,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,

259
0:11:02.182,000 --> 0:11:04,000
from this side. Where are you, Sam?

260
0:11:04.89,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause)

261
0:11:06.686,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And Eduardo.

262
0:11:08.356,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

263
0:11:10.172,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Cheers, mate.

264
0:11:12.866,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Cheers.

265
0:11:14.956,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)

266
0:11:21.656,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So what have we done here?

267
0:11:22.943,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet

268
0:11:25.96,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and use science as a tool for invention,

269
0:11:29.28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we've paid attention to the biological evidence,

270
0:11:32.136,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we've put importance to the

271
0:11:33.826,000 --> 0:11:34,000
human anecdotal evidence,

272
0:11:35.536,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and we've used science as a tool

273
0:11:38.618,000 --> 0:11:39,000
for translation,

274
0:11:40.021,000 --> 0:11:42,000
translation of something that was already there

275
0:11:42.248,000 --> 0:11:45,000
into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind.

276
0:11:45.819,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it strikes me that this idea of science

277
0:11:47.743,000 --> 0:11:5,000
as a tool for translation rather than invention

278
0:11:50.799,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is one that we can apply much more widely than this

279
0:11:53.463,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in the pursuit of innovation.

280
0:11:55.41,000 --> 0:11:57,000
After all, did the Wright brothers

281
0:11:57.735,000 --> 0:11:59,000
discover manned flight,

282
0:11:59.787,000 --> 0:12:02,000
or did they observe the biological fact of flight

283
0:12:02.976,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and translate that mechanically, replicate it

284
0:12:06.168,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in a way that humans could use?

285
0:12:08.685,000 --> 0:12:09,000
As for the humble wetsuit,

286
0:12:10.219,000 --> 0:12:11,000
who knows what oceanwear will look like

287
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in two years' time, in five years' time

288
0:12:15.111,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,

289
0:12:18.203,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I'm guessing there's a fair chance

290
0:12:19.469,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it won't be pure black.

291
0:12:21.19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Thank you.

292
0:12:23.359,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

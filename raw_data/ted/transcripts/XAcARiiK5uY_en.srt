1
0:00:12.72,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There are a few things that all of us need.

2
0:00:17.8,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We all need air to breathe.

3
0:00:21.32,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We need clean water to drink.

4
0:00:23.72,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We need food to eat. We need shelter and love.

5
0:00:26.76,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You know. Love is great, too.

6
0:00:30.36,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And we all need a safe place to pee.

7
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter) Yeah?

8
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary,

9
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:41,000
if I could change the world tomorrow

10
0:00:43.04,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to make it easier for me to navigate,

11
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the very first thing I would do

12
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms

13
0:00:52.28,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in all public places.

14
0:00:54.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Applause)

15
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Trans people and trans issues,

16
0:01:03.68,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.

17
0:01:07.64,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And this is a great and necessary thing,

18
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but most of that attention has been focused

19
0:01:12.88,000 --> 0:01:14,000
on a very few individuals,

20
0:01:15.32,000 --> 0:01:16,000
most of whom are kinda rich

21
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and pretty famous,

22
0:01:19.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee

23
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in between classes at their community college,

24
0:01:25.56,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip

25
0:01:28.32,000 --> 0:01:29,000
at their public high school.

26
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Fame and money insulates these television star trans people

27
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:38,000
from most of the everyday challenges

28
0:01:39.28,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.

29
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Public bathrooms.

30
0:01:49.2,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember,

31
0:01:53.72,000 --> 0:01:56,000
first when I was just a little baby tomboy

32
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms

35
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.

36
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.

37
0:02:17.6,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.

38
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about,

39
0:02:24.76,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse

40
0:02:29.52,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day

41
0:02:32.12,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change

42
0:02:35.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and a large hard candy collection.

43
0:02:37.92,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:40.8,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I know what some of you are thinking,

45
0:02:44.8,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and you're mostly right.

46
0:02:47.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.

47
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?

48
0:02:59.52,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.

49
0:03:05.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'm a trans person.

50
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And now we've got these fearmongering politicians

51
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.

52
0:03:14.28,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Have you heard about these?

53
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They try to legislate to try and force people like myself

54
0:03:18.44,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate

55
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
according to the gender I was assigned at birth.

56
0:03:25.72,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if these politicians ever get their way,

57
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in Arizona or California or Florida

58
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
or just last week in Houston, Texas,

59
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or Ottawa,

60
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:41,000
well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.

61
0:03:43.88,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table,

62
0:03:47.619,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I can't help but wonder, you know,

63
0:03:49.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right?

64
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Panty checks?

65
0:03:57.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Really.

66
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?

67
0:04:06.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There's no legal or ethical or plausible way

68
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to enforce laws like these anyway.

69
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They exist only to foster fear

70
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and promote transphobia.

71
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They don't make anyone safer.

72
0:04:24.4,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.

73
0:04:28.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.

74
0:04:31.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.

75
0:04:36.44,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth

76
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms,

77
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but also universities,

78
0:04:48.6,000 --> 0:04:5,000
hospitals, libraries.

79
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.

80
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If we don't move now

81
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to make sure that these places

82
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
are truly open and accessible to everyone,

83
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
then we just need to get honest

84
0:05:09.64,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and quit calling them public places.

85
0:05:13.8,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We need to just admit

86
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that they are really only open for people

87
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes,

88
0:05:25.6,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which I do not.

89
0:05:28.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I never have.

90
0:05:32.24,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And this starts very early.

91
0:05:35.4,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.

92
0:05:39.44,000 --> 0:05:42,000
She's a self-identified tomboy.

93
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I'm talking about cowboy boots

94
0:05:44.96,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.

95
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
One time I asked her what her favorite color was.

96
0:05:52.24,000 --> 0:05:54,000
She told me, "Camouflage."

97
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:57.68,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So that awesome little kid,

99
0:05:59.84,000 --> 0:06:01,000
she came home from school last October

100
0:06:02.68,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from her half day of preschool

101
0:06:04.96,000 --> 0:06:08,000
with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her

102
0:06:09.04,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.

103
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.

104
0:06:17.32,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice

105
0:06:20.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
at the Halloween party,

106
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.

107
0:06:27.68,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.

108
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Her and her classmates were four years old.

109
0:06:34.64,000 --> 0:06:37,000
They already felt empowered enough

110
0:06:37.72,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.

111
0:06:44.44,000 --> 0:06:45,000
She was four years old.

112
0:06:45.76,000 --> 0:06:48,000
She had already been taught the brutal lesson

113
0:06:48.88,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that there was no bathroom door at preschool

114
0:06:53.24,000 --> 0:06:57,000
with a sign on it that welcomed people like her.

115
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem,

116
0:07:02.76,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and that problem started with her

117
0:07:06.56,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and was hers alone.

118
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter,

119
0:07:14.52,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and I did.

120
0:07:16.56,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I wanted to tell her

121
0:07:19.08,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that me and her mom were going to march on down

122
0:07:21.29,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away,

123
0:07:24.24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but I knew that wasn't true.

124
0:07:25.64,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older,

125
0:07:29.48,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but I couldn't.

126
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened,

127
0:07:37.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
asked her to tell me how it made her feel.

128
0:07:41.4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"Mad and sad,"

129
0:07:44.76,000 --> 0:07:45,000
she told me.

130
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So I told her

131
0:07:48.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that she wasn't alone

132
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and that it wasn't right what had happened to her,

133
0:07:53.4,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.

134
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I said yes, I had,

135
0:08:01.76,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but not for a really long time.

136
0:08:03.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Which of course was a lie,

138
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43,

139
0:08:09.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit

140
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:13,000
when you cough or sneeze,

141
0:08:14.08,000 --> 0:08:17,000
when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.

142
0:08:17.28,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Don't lie.

143
0:08:18.84,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It happens. Right?

144
0:08:20.6,000 --> 0:08:22,000
She doesn't need to know that, I figure.

145
0:08:22.8,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

146
0:08:25.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.

147
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
When you get old like me,

148
0:08:32.44,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer,

149
0:08:36.4,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I promised her.

150
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"Until you can get home?"

151
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
she asked me.

152
0:08:44.72,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I said, "Yes,

153
0:08:48.24,000 --> 0:08:49,000
until you can get home."

154
0:08:52.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
She seemed to take some comfort in that.

155
0:08:58.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms

156
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.

157
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We can't change the world overnight

158
0:09:12.4,000 --> 0:09:13,000
for our children,

159
0:09:13.64,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but we can give them a safe and private place

160
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to escape that world,

161
0:09:17.6,000 --> 0:09:2,000
if only for just a minute.

162
0:09:22.2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This we can do.

163
0:09:25.28,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So let's just do it.

164
0:09:27.84,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now

165
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority,

166
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:37,000
or it's too expensive,

167
0:09:37.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee

168
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or get changed in

169
0:09:42.68,000 --> 0:09:47,000
supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality,

170
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or your masculinity,

171
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or your religious beliefs,

172
0:09:52.28,000 --> 0:09:54,000
then let me just appeal

173
0:09:54.56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully,

174
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
does care about the rest of the population.

175
0:10:03.76,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me,

176
0:10:09.92,000 --> 0:10:11,000
then what about women and girls

177
0:10:12.24,000 --> 0:10:14,000
with body image issues?

178
0:10:14.8,000 --> 0:10:17,000
What about anyone with body image stuff going on?

179
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates,

180
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?

181
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Oh, grade eight,

182
0:10:30.84,000 --> 0:10:33,000
what a cruel master you can be.

183
0:10:34.04,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Right?

184
0:10:35.8,000 --> 0:10:38,000
What about people with anxiety issues?

185
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:42,000
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?

186
0:10:43.56,000 --> 0:10:46,000
What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason,

187
0:10:47.08,000 --> 0:10:51,000
don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?

188
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
How many of us still feel shy

189
0:10:54.64,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers,

190
0:10:58.2,000 --> 0:11:,000
and how many of us allow that fear

191
0:11:00.8,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to keep us from something as important

192
0:11:04.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
as physical exercise?

193
0:11:09.2,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Would all those people not benefit

194
0:11:12.72,000 --> 0:11:14,000
from these single stall facilities?

195
0:11:17.04,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We can't change transphobic minds overnight,

196
0:11:23.24,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but we can give everybody

197
0:11:26.24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
a place to get changed in

198
0:11:30.08,000 --> 0:11:32,000
so that we can all get to work

199
0:11:33.88,000 --> 0:11:34,000
making the world safer

200
0:11:36.8,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for all of us.

201
0:11:39.64,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you for listening.

202
0:11:40.88,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

203
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Thank you.

204
0:11:44.4,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

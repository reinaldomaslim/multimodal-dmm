2
0:00:16.244,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.

3
0:00:20.41,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy."

4
0:00:24.244,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I was very proud.

5
0:00:26.34,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,

6
0:00:29.889,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but we never learned much about the outside world,

7
0:00:34.241,000 --> 0:00:37,000
except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.

8
0:00:39.066,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Although I often wondered about the outside world,

9
0:00:42.479,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,

10
0:00:46.143,000 --> 0:00:48,000
until everything suddenly changed.

11
0:00:49.847,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.

12
0:00:54.844,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.

13
0:00:58.039,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My family was not poor,

14
0:00:59.977,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and myself, I had never experienced hunger.

15
0:01:03.674,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter

16
0:01:08.239,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from a coworker's sister.

17
0:01:10.263,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It read, "When you read this,

18
0:01:13.298,000 --> 0:01:17,000
our five family members will not exist in this world,

19
0:01:18.154,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks.

20
0:01:22.233,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We are lying on the floor together,

21
0:01:24.693,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die."

22
0:01:33.876,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was so shocked.

23
0:01:36.868,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.

24
0:01:43.431,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Soon after, when I was walking past a train station,

25
0:01:46.284,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory.

26
0:01:51.641,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,

27
0:01:54.661,000 --> 0:01:57,000
while an emaciated child in her arms

28
0:01:57.85,000 --> 0:02:,000
just stared helplessly at his mother's face.

29
0:02:02.776,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But nobody helped them,

30
0:02:04.682,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.

31
0:02:11.281,000 --> 0:02:14,000
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.

32
0:02:15.345,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,

33
0:02:20.05,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark.

34
0:02:26.943,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Power outages also became more and more frequent,

35
0:02:30.227,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so everything around me was completely dark at night,

36
0:02:34.666,000 --> 0:02:36,000
except for the sea of lights in China,

37
0:02:37.136,000 --> 0:02:39,000
just across the river from my home.

38
0:02:39.666,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.

39
0:02:45.511,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night,

40
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
compared to neighbors.

41
0:02:52.918,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This is the Amnok River,

42
0:02:54.639,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.

43
0:02:59.694,000 --> 0:03:03,000
As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,

44
0:03:03.833,000 --> 0:03:05,000
allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.

45
0:03:08.307,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But many die.

46
0:03:09.974,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.

47
0:03:17.585,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,

48
0:03:22.387,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine,

49
0:03:26.549,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.

50
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family

51
0:03:36.267,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for a short time.

52
0:03:37.859,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I could have never imagined

53
0:03:39.799,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that it would take 14 years to live together.

54
0:03:44.298,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.

55
0:03:48.346,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I had no idea what life was going to be like

56
0:03:51.689,000 --> 0:03:52,000
as a North Korean refugee.

57
0:03:53.736,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,

58
0:03:57.353,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it's also very dangerous,

59
0:03:59.775,000 --> 0:04:05,000
since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants.

60
0:04:07.422,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed,

61
0:04:12.017,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate,

62
0:04:15.392,000 --> 0:04:16,000
back in North Korea.

63
0:04:18.229,000 --> 0:04:2,000
One day, my worst nightmare came true,

64
0:04:20.951,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when I was caught by the Chinese police,

65
0:04:23.698,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and brought to the police station for interrogation.

66
0:04:27.789,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Someone had accused me of being North Korean,

67
0:04:31.471,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so they tested my Chinese language abilities,

68
0:04:34.876,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and asked me tons of questions.

69
0:04:38.17,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I was so scared.

70
0:04:40.612,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I thought my heart was going to explode.

71
0:04:43.424,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated.

72
0:04:49.257,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I thought my life was over.

73
0:04:51.892,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me,

74
0:04:54.792,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and answer the questions.

75
0:04:57.14,000 --> 0:04:58,000
After they finished questioning me,

76
0:04:58.922,000 --> 0:05:,000
one official said to another,

77
0:05:01.371,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"This was a false report. She's not North Korean."

78
0:05:05.273,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And they let me go. It was a miracle.

79
0:05:09.503,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies.

80
0:05:14.473,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But many can be caught by the Chinese police,

81
0:05:17.965,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and repatriated.

82
0:05:19.711,000 --> 0:05:2,000
These girls were so lucky.

83
0:05:21.451,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Even though they were caught,

84
0:05:23.14,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they were eventually released, after heavy international pressure.

85
0:05:28.059,000 --> 0:05:31,000
These North Koreans were not so lucky.

86
0:05:31.21,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China

87
0:05:35.232,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and repatriated to North Korea,

88
0:05:37.827,000 --> 0:05:42,000
where they can be tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed.

89
0:05:44.037,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Even though I was really fortunate to get out,

90
0:05:47.141,000 --> 0:05:49,000
many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.

91
0:05:50.41,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities

92
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and struggle so hard just to survive.

93
0:05:58.194,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Even after learning a new language and getting a job,

94
0:06:01.232,000 --> 0:06:04,000
their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant.

95
0:06:05.367,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,

96
0:06:09.043,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I decided to risk going to South Korea.

97
0:06:13.224,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I started a new life yet again.

98
0:06:16.206,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Settling down in South Korea

99
0:06:17.818,000 --> 0:06:2,000
was a lot more challenging than I had expected.

100
0:06:21.591,000 --> 0:06:24,000
English was so important in South Korea,

101
0:06:24.948,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so I had to start learning my third language.

102
0:06:28.694,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South.

103
0:06:33.281,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We are all Korean, but inside,

104
0:06:35.458,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we have become very different, due to 67 years of division.

105
0:06:41.191,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I even went through an identity crisis.

106
0:06:44.929,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Am I South Korean or North Korean?

107
0:06:48.219,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Where am I from? Who am I?

108
0:06:51.489,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own.

109
0:06:58.977,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,

110
0:07:02.738,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I made a plan -- I started studying for the university entrance exam.

111
0:07:07.583,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life,

112
0:07:11.345,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I received a shocking phone call.

113
0:07:13.805,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money

114
0:07:16.535,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that I sent to my family,

115
0:07:18.194,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed

116
0:07:23.24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to a desolate location in the countryside.

117
0:07:26.763,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They had to get out quickly.

118
0:07:29.143,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So I started planning how to help them escape.

119
0:07:32.859,000 --> 0:07:35,000
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances

120
0:07:36.389,000 --> 0:07:37,000
on the path to freedom.

121
0:07:38.929,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's almost impossible to cross the border

122
0:07:41.642,000 --> 0:07:43,000
between North Korea and South Korea.

123
0:07:44.599,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, ironically, I took a flight back to China

124
0:07:47.966,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and headed toward the North Korean border.

125
0:07:52.083,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,

126
0:07:54.805,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles

127
0:07:59.678,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in China, and then into Southeast Asia.

128
0:08:04.003,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The journey by bus took one week,

129
0:08:06.121,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we were almost caught several times.

130
0:08:09.461,000 --> 0:08:15,000
One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer.

131
0:08:16.615,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He took everyone's I.D. cards,

132
0:08:18.386,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and he started asking them questions.

133
0:08:21.127,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Since my family couldn't understand Chinese,

134
0:08:25.929,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I thought my family was going to be arrested.

135
0:08:29.092,000 --> 0:08:31,000
As the Chinese officer approached my family,

136
0:08:31.837,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I impulsively stood up, and I told him

137
0:08:34.515,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning.

138
0:08:39.277,000 --> 0:08:41,000
He looked at me suspiciously,

139
0:08:41.392,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but luckily, he believed me.

140
0:08:45.275,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We made it all the way to the border of Laos.

141
0:08:48.881,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But I had to spend almost all my money

142
0:08:53.252,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to bribe the border guards in Laos.

143
0:08:56.3,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But even after we got past the border,

144
0:08:58.611,000 --> 0:09:02,000
my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing.

145
0:09:04.069,000 --> 0:09:06,000
After I paid the fine and bribe,

146
0:09:06.241,000 --> 0:09:08,000
my family was released in one month.

147
0:09:09.83,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again,

148
0:09:13.836,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the capital of Laos.

149
0:09:16.828,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This was one of the lowest points in my life.

150
0:09:20.831,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I did everything to get my family to freedom,

151
0:09:26.042,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and we came so close,

152
0:09:28.416,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but my family was thrown in jail,

153
0:09:30.713,000 --> 0:09:32,000
just a short distance from the South Korean embassy.

154
0:09:34.557,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I went back and forth between the immigration office

155
0:09:37.337,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and the police station,

156
0:09:39.239,000 --> 0:09:41,000
desperately trying to get my family out.

157
0:09:42.176,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore.

158
0:09:46.359,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I lost all hope.

159
0:09:48.184,000 --> 0:09:51,000
At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me,

160
0:09:51.97,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"What's wrong?"

161
0:09:53.107,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask.

162
0:09:58.762,000 --> 0:10:,000
In my broken English, and with a dictionary,

163
0:10:01.191,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I explained the situation, and without hesitating,

164
0:10:05.145,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the man went to the ATM,

165
0:10:07.416,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and he paid the rest of the money for my family,

166
0:10:10.193,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and two other North Koreans to get out of jail.

167
0:10:14.452,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,

168
0:10:17.809,000 --> 0:10:18,000
"Why are you helping me?"

169
0:10:20.271,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"I'm not helping you," he said.

170
0:10:22.644,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"I'm helping the North Korean people."

171
0:10:25.581,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.

172
0:10:30.274,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people,

173
0:10:35.323,000 --> 0:10:36,000
when we needed it most.

174
0:10:37.274,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers

175
0:10:40.148,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and the support of the international community

176
0:10:43.152,000 --> 0:10:46,000
are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.

177
0:10:48.337,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Eventually, after our long journey,

178
0:10:50.568,000 --> 0:10:53,000
my family and I were reunited in South Korea.

179
0:10:54.305,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But getting to freedom is only half the battle.

180
0:10:57.837,000 --> 0:11:,000
Many North Koreans are separated from their families,

181
0:11:01.337,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and when they arrive in a new country,

182
0:11:03.921,000 --> 0:11:05,000
they start with little or no money.

183
0:11:07.71,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So we can benefit from the international community

184
0:11:10.766,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for education, English language training, job training, and more.

185
0:11:16.328,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We can also act as a bridge

186
0:11:18.169,000 --> 0:11:21,000
between the people inside North Korea and the outside world.

187
0:11:22.494,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside,

188
0:11:27.789,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and we send information and money

189
0:11:29.957,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that is helping to change North Korea from inside.

190
0:11:34.592,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life,

191
0:11:39.769,000 --> 0:11:42,000
so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans

192
0:11:43.014,000 --> 0:11:47,000
a chance to prosper with international support.

193
0:11:48.821,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans

194
0:11:52.15,000 --> 0:11:54,000
succeeding all over the world,

195
0:11:54.301,000 --> 0:11:55,000
including the TED stage.

196
0:11:56.483,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Thank you.

197
0:11:57.659,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

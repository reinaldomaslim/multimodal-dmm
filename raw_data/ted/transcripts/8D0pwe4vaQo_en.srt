1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I got a B+. (Laughter)

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I'm gonna try and do that within

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and to follow the TED commandments:

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that is, actually, something that creates

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
a near-death experience,

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but near-death is good for creativity.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter) OK.

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So, I also want to explain,

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;

17
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and the one that's in between that is the censor

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I'm going do that also by looking at

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
what I think is part of my creative process,

22
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which includes a number of things that happened, actually --

23
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the nothing started even earlier than the moment

24
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in which I'm creating something new.

25
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And that includes nature, and nurture,

26
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and what I refer to as nightmares.

27
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not

28
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we are innately equipped with something, perhaps

29
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in our brains, some abnormal chromosome

30
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that causes this muse-like effect.

31
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.

32
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And others, like my mother,

33
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
would say that I get my material from past lives.

34
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Some people would also say that creativity

35
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --

36
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.

37
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently

38
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,

39
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,

40
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --

41
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.

42
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I will mention that I actually developed

43
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,

44
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but it was during the time I was writing my last book,

45
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and some people say that book is quite different.

46
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:

47
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,

48
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
why am I not black like everybody else?

49
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And sometimes you're equipped with skills,

50
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.

51
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.

52
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I had a miniature poodle.

53
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.

54
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.

55
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.

56
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,

57
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,

58
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make

59
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
my living out of the artful arrangement of words.

60
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.

61
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,

62
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.

63
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
That figure right there, by the way,

64
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,

65
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.

66
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,

67
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
this was supposed to be my side occupation,

68
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it led to a sense of failure.

69
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But actually, there was something quite real in my life

70
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that happened when I was about 14.

71
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,

72
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
six months later, had brain tumors.

73
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,

74
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.

75
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,

76
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and that God's will would take care of that.

77
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.

78
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses

79
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe

80
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
why this would have happened.

81
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.

82
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
There was a reason for everything.

83
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,

84
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.

85
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so, I had this notion of death all around me,

86
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.

87
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,

88
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you begin to think very much about everything.

89
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You become very creative, in a survival sense.

90
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And this, then, led to my big questions.

91
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And they're the same ones that I have today.

92
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?

93
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?

94
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.

95
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,

96
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,

97
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in what order they happen. What are the influences?

98
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?

99
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.

100
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,

101
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as the creator of that universe.

102
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth

103
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out

104
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
-- years and years, oftentimes.

105
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability

106
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.

107
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on

108
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
throughout this conference,

109
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
almost everything that's been going on.

110
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:

111
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,

112
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but I'm still gonna use it as the process

113
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
for explaining how it is the metaphor.

114
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.

115
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.

116
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.

117
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But when you make those associations,

118
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,

119
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.

120
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.

121
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,

122
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as I understand it. (Laughter)

123
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And this happens constantly in the writing.

124
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,

125
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in which you're looking for something, and

126
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you know, things are happening simultaneously,

127
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you're looking at it in a different way,

128
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,

129
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,

130
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
then you will only write the about.

131
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You won't discover anything.

132
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And what you were supposed to find,

133
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,

134
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is no longer there.

135
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, I don't want to ignore

136
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the other side of what happens in our universe,

137
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
like many of our scientists have.

138
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,

139
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and just say that creative people are multidimensional,

140
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.

141
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.

142
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There is also a big question of ambiguity.

143
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.

144
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.

145
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable

146
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.

147
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It is constantly there. And, just as an example,

148
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
this is one that recently came to me.

149
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman

150
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,

151
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

152
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.

153
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there

154
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.

155
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, there was another one that I came across,

156
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it's "saving fish from drowning."

157
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,

158
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because they're not supposed to kill anything.

159
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.

160
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,

161
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.

162
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors

163
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,

164
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:

165
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

166
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,

167
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
or you're going to get stuck.

168
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.

169
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,

170
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.

171
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.

172
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And then we have intentions.

173
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,

174
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and then we do something.

175
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.

176
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?

177
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
What are we supposed to do?

178
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Do we stay in for life,

179
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,

180
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?

181
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
That is the ambiguity in my life

182
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called

183
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
"Saving Fish From Drowning."

184
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.

185
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I got these hints everywhere.

186
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.

187
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,

188
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.

189
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.

190
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And when I have the question, it is a focus.

191
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through

192
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.

193
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And it seems like it's happening all the time.

194
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,

195
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in which you're getting all this help from the universe.

196
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.

197
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And you are noticing it more often.

198
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But you apply this.

199
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.

200
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?

201
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Why or why not?

202
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It may be something that is perhaps more serious

203
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
-- as I said, human rights in Burma.

204
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show

205
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that I approved of the military regime there.

206
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,

207
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions

208
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that other people have given us?"

209
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,

210
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,

211
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who was a Baptist minister.

212
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,

213
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and still didn't know that if I went there,

214
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --

215
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.

216
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.

217
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?

218
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,

219
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?

220
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,

221
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and we talked about today, is genocide.

222
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This leads to this question.

223
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,

224
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and I consider what my intentions should be,

225
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child

226
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,

227
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and what is my place in the universe?

228
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.

229
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,

230
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and yet it is also absolutely necessary.

231
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.

232
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.

233
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,

234
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.

235
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,

236
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,

237
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,

238
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and that actually was the way it happened.

239
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.

240
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
There are also things, quite uncanny,

241
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.

242
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In this case, I was writing a story

243
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.

244
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.

245
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I took down this book, and I --

246
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,

247
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,

248
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,

249
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and a character who thought he was the son of God.

250
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You wonder, are these things random chance?

251
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?

252
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?

253
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And that goes into the story, too.

254
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.

255
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Especially when good things happen,

256
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and, in particular, when bad things happen.

257
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,

258
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and I do want to know what those elements are,

259
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.

260
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.

261
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place

262
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,

263
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and we ended up in this non-tourist location,

264
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
a beautiful village, pristine.

265
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
And we walked three valleys beyond,

266
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,

267
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.

268
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.

269
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.

270
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.

271
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,

272
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,

273
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
walking along the beach, I came across this.

274
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And it was a man, a Chinese man,

275
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.

276
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"

277
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."

278
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.

279
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,

280
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and I cannot explain it.

281
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence

282
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
in writing about these things?

283
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?

284
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.

285
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.

286
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
What is the nature of accidents?

287
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,

288
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
outside of a court of law?

289
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I was able to see that in a firsthand way,

290
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.

291
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.

292
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me

293
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
if I wanted to write anything about China.

294
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.

295
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,

296
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,

297
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.

298
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.

299
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Responsibility was assigned to the family.

300
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.

301
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.

302
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
It's the son, not the father."

303
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.

304
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.

305
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.

306
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And I began to sense something different about the history,

307
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,

308
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links

309
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.

310
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,

311
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men

312
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.

313
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,

314
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,

315
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and seeing the amazing things that happened,

316
0:19:18.33,000 --> 0:19:23,000
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,

317
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
determining how things happen.

318
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:29,000
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,

319
0:19:29.33,000 --> 0:19:33,000
the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me

320
0:19:33.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,

321
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
and that is where I'm gonna find the answers

322
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

323
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,

324
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.

325
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.

326
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.

327
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:05,000
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?

328
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
And how do I create my own life?

329
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And I think it is by questioning,

330
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.

331
0:20:15.33,000 --> 0:20:19,000
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,

332
0:20:19.33,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and the past, the specifics of that past,

333
0:20:22.33,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and what is happening in the story at that point.

334
0:20:26.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
I also believe that in thinking about things --

335
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,

336
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:37,000
God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --

337
0:20:37.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.

338
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:47,000
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,

339
0:20:47.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?

340
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --

341
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.

342
0:21:03.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.

343
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:13,000
And they have to be in all possibilities,

344
0:21:13.33,000 --> 0:21:16,000
including those I never considered before.

345
0:21:16.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
So, there are never complete answers.

346
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind

347
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
myself that there is uncertainty in everything,

348
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:33,000
and that is good, because then I will discover something new.

349
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,

350
0:21:37.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
it is to simply imagine.

351
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:44,000
And to imagine is to put myself in that story,

352
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:5,000
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.

353
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story

354
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:22:02,000
-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,

355
0:22:02.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.

356
0:22:06.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
Because for everything,

357
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:12,000
in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.

358
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:18,000
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.

359
0:22:18.33,000 --> 0:22:2,000
We've come to the end of the talk,

360
0:22:20.33,000 --> 0:22:24,000
and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,

361
0:22:24.33,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and it is the things that transform in our lives,

362
0:22:27.33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
that are wonderful and stay with us.

363
0:22:37.33,000 --> 0:22:38,000
There she is.

364
0:22:38.33,000 --> 0:22:4,000
Thank you very much!

365
0:22:40.33,000 --> 0:22:46,000
(Applause)

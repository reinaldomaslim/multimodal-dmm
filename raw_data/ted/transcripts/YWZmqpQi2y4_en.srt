1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
this idea that there is a narrative line,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and that music exists in time.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A film also exists in time; it's an experience

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that you should go through emotionally.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
were all about learning something,

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and really to follow my journey.

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we meet people along the way.

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We only meet them once.

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's something like life, that once you get in it

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
you can't get out.

19
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There are two clips I want to show you,

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the first one is a kind of hodgepodge,

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
its just three little moments, four little moments

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with three of the people who are here tonight.

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's not the way they occur in the film,

24
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because they are part of much larger scenes.

25
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They play off each other in a wonderful way.

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
talking about something that is very dear to him,

28
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which is the accidents of life.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,

30
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and perhaps not planned at all.

31
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And those three clips will be followed by a scene of

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

34
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He built the capital over there.

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen --

36
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.

37
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We were the first film crew in there.

38
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.

39
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it was built entirely by hand,

41
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I think they got a crane the last year.

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,

43
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,

44
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
dumping them in the forms.

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It is the capital of the country,

46
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and it took 23 years to build,

47
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.

48
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It took as long as the Taj Mahal.

49
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.

50
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
He died in 1974.

51
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The building was finished in 1983.

52
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So it continued on for many years

53
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
after he died.

54
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Think about that when you see that building,

55
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And that really struck me about my father,

57
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in the sense that he had such belief

58
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that somehow, doing these things

59
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,

60
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,

61
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the construction stopped totally and he kept working,

62
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because he felt, "Well when the war is done

63
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they'll need this building."

64
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.

65
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Roll that tape.

66
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.

68
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I came home and I said to my father and mother,

69
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,

70
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and he's sort of ugly, funny voice,

71
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and he's a teacher at school.

72
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day

73
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that someday you will hear of him,

74
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because he's really an amazing man."

75
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Frank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?

76
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
NK: Did you hear that, really?

79
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.

80
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.

81
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,

82
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office

83
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us

85
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.

86
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,

87
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it was so consistent with his life, you know?

88
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,

89
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or I'm going to die in an airport,

90
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or die jogging without an identification on me.

91
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I don't know why I sort of carry that

92
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from that memory of the way he died.

93
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But he was a sort of a nomad at heart.

94
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and how full of influence by circumstance.

96
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here

97
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere

98
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.

99
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We are proud of it.

100
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
NK: You're proud of it?

101
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.

102
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
NK: Do you know anything about the architect?

103
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.

104
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,

105
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
he was my father.

106
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?

107
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.

108
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Man: Louis Kahn, yes!

109
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Man: Your father, is he alive?

111
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.

112
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Man: Very pleased to welcome you back.

113
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
NK: Thank you.

114
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.

115
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
No, he never saw this.

116
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Shamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.

117
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,

118
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and since we invited him here,

119
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
he felt that he has got a responsibility.

120
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.

121
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He is not a political man,

122
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but in this guise he has given us

123
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the institution for democracy, from where we can rise.

124
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In that way it is so relevant.

125
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He didn't care for how much money this country has,

126
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
or whether he would be able to ever finish this building,

127
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.

128
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.

129
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
NK: It cost him his life.

130
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
SW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,

131
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that is why he is great and we'll remember him.

132
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But he was also human.

133
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now his failure to satisfy the family life,

134
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is an inevitable association of great people.

135
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But I think his son will understand this,

136
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and will have no sense of grudge,

137
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or sense of being neglected, I think.

138
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
He cared in a very different manner,

139
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but it takes a lot of time to understand that.

140
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In social aspect of his life

141
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.

142
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He could not say no to anything,

143
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that is why, that he cannot say no to things,

144
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we got this building today.

145
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You see, only that way you can be able to understand him.

146
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
There is no other shortcut,

147
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
no other way to really understand him.

148
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But I think he has given us this building

149
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we feel all the time for him,

150
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that's why, he has given love for us.

151
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He could not probably give the right kind of love for you,

152
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,

153
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that is important.

154
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You have to understand that.

155
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He had an enormous amount of love,

156
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
he loved everybody.

157
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
To love everybody, he sometimes did not see

1
0:00:12.971,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What I'm about to share with you are findings from a study

2
0:00:16.234,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of the brains of more than 1,000 children and adolescents.

3
0:00:20.038,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now, these were children who were recruited

4
0:00:22.062,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from diverse homes around the United States,

5
0:00:24.376,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and this picture is an average of all of their brains.

6
0:00:28.189,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The front of this average brain is on your left

7
0:00:30.427,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and the back of this average brain is on your right.

8
0:00:33.287,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now, one of the things we were very interested in

9
0:00:35.71,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was the surface area of the cerebral cortex,

10
0:00:38.849,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or the thin, wrinkly layer on the outer surface of the brain

11
0:00:41.887,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that does most of the cognitive heavy lifting.

12
0:00:46.673,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And that's because past work by other scientists has suggested

13
0:00:49.838,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that in many cases,

14
0:00:51.406,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a larger cortical surface area

15
0:00:53.684,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is often associated with higher intelligence.

16
0:00:57.221,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, in this study, we found one factor

17
0:01:00.282,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that was associated with the cortical surface area

18
0:01:02.879,000 --> 0:01:05,000
across nearly the entire surface of the brain.

19
0:01:07.891,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That factor was family income.

20
0:01:12.401,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, here, every point you see in color is a point where higher family income

21
0:01:16.943,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was associated with a larger cortical surface area in that spot.

22
0:01:21.592,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And there were some regions, shown here in yellow,

23
0:01:24.227,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where that association was particularly pronounced.

24
0:01:27.351,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And those are regions that we know support a certain set of cognitive skills:

25
0:01:31.919,000 --> 0:01:34,000
language skills like vocabulary and reading

26
0:01:35.353,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as well as the ability to avoid distraction

27
0:01:37.669,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and exert self-control.

28
0:01:39.525,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And that's important,

29
0:01:41.046,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because those are the very skills

30
0:01:43.049,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that children living in poverty are most likely to struggle with.

31
0:01:47.4,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In fact, a child living with poverty

32
0:01:50.053,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is likely to perform worse on tests of language and impulse control

33
0:01:54.543,000 --> 0:01:56,000
before they even turn two.

34
0:01:58.013,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now, there are a few points I'd like to highlight about this study.

35
0:02:01.51,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Number one:

36
0:02:02.701,000 --> 0:02:05,000
this link between family income and children's brain structure

37
0:02:06.383,000 --> 0:02:08,000
was strongest at the lowest income levels.

38
0:02:09.447,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So that means that dollar for dollar,

39
0:02:11.588,000 --> 0:02:13,000
relatively small differences in family income

40
0:02:13.976,000 --> 0:02:16,000
were associated with proportionately greater differences in brain structure

41
0:02:17.67,000 --> 0:02:19,000
among the most disadvantaged families.

42
0:02:20.137,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And intuitively, that makes sense, right?

43
0:02:22.321,000 --> 0:02:26,000
An extra 20,000 dollars for a family earning, say, 150,000 dollars a year

44
0:02:26.607,000 --> 0:02:3,000
would certainly be nice, but probably not game-changing,

45
0:02:30.941,000 --> 0:02:31,000
whereas an extra 20,000 dollars

46
0:02:32.789,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for a family only earning 20,000 dollars a year

47
0:02:35.214,000 --> 0:02:38,000
would likely make a remarkable difference in their day-to-day lives.

48
0:02:39.254,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, the second point I'd like to highlight

49
0:02:41.278,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is that this link between family income and children's brain structure

50
0:02:45.635,000 --> 0:02:47,000
didn't depend on the children's age,

51
0:02:47.824,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it didn't depend on their sex

52
0:02:50.069,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and it didn't depend on their race or ethnicity.

53
0:02:53.982,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the final point --

54
0:02:55.156,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and this one's key --

55
0:02:56.534,000 --> 0:03:,000
there was tremendous variability from one child to the next,

56
0:03:01.03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by which I mean there were plenty of children from higher-income homes

57
0:03:04.358,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with smaller brain surfaces

58
0:03:06.217,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and plenty of children from lower-income homes

59
0:03:09.021,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with larger brain surfaces.

60
0:03:11.553,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Here's an analogy.

61
0:03:12.875,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We all know that in childhood,

62
0:03:14.536,000 --> 0:03:16,000
boys tend to be taller than girls,

63
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but go into any elementary school classroom,

64
0:03:19.574,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and you'll find some girls who are taller than some boys.

65
0:03:23.778,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So while growing up in poverty is certainly a risk factor

66
0:03:26.509,000 --> 0:03:27,000
for a smaller brain surface,

67
0:03:28.261,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in no way can I know an individual child's family income

68
0:03:32.168,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and know with any accuracy

69
0:03:33.463,000 --> 0:03:35,000
what that particular child's brain would look like.

70
0:03:37.167,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I want you to imagine, for a moment, two children.

71
0:03:40.033,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One is a young child born into poverty in America;

72
0:03:42.967,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the other is also an American child,

73
0:03:45.508,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but one who was born into more fortunate circumstances.

74
0:03:49.286,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, at birth, we find absolutely no differences

75
0:03:53.252,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in how their brains work.

76
0:03:56.322,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But by the time those two kids are ready to start kindergarten,

77
0:03:59.357,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we know that the child living in poverty

78
0:04:01.734,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is likely to have cognitive scores that are, on average, 60 percent lower

79
0:04:06.631,000 --> 0:04:07,000
than those of the other child.

80
0:04:09.309,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Later on, that child living in poverty

81
0:04:11.24,000 --> 0:04:14,000
will be five times more likely to drop out of high school,

82
0:04:14.566,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and if she does graduate high school,

83
0:04:16.383,000 --> 0:04:18,000
she'll be less likely to earn a college degree.

84
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
By the time those two kids are 35 years old,

85
0:04:23.434,000 --> 0:04:26,000
if the first child spent her entire childhood living in poverty,

86
0:04:27.404,000 --> 0:04:31,000
she is up to 75 times more likely to be poor herself.

87
0:04:34.103,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But it doesn't have to be that way.

88
0:04:36.231,000 --> 0:04:41,000
As a neuroscientist, one of things I find most exciting about the human brain

89
0:04:41.517,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is that our experiences change our brains.

90
0:04:45.611,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, this concept, known as neuroplasticity,

91
0:04:49.459,000 --> 0:04:51,000
means that these differences in children's brain structure

92
0:04:52.238,000 --> 0:04:54,000
don't doom a child to a life of low achievement.

93
0:04:55.716,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The brain is not destiny.

94
0:04:59.51,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And if a child's brain can be changed,

95
0:05:01.714,000 --> 0:05:02,000
then anything is possible.

96
0:05:04.999,000 --> 0:05:08,000
As a society, we spend billions of dollars each year, educating our children.

97
0:05:09.934,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So what can we tell schools, teachers and parents

98
0:05:12.486,000 --> 0:05:14,000
who want to help support kids from disadvantaged backgrounds

99
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to do their best in school and in life?

100
0:05:17.919,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, emerging science suggests

101
0:05:19.772,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that growing up in poverty is associated with a host of different experiences

102
0:05:24.064,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and that these experiences in turn may work together

103
0:05:26.737,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to help shape brain development and ultimately help kids learn.

104
0:05:30.225,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And so if this is right,

105
0:05:31.604,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it begs the question:

106
0:05:32.952,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Where along this pathway can we step in and provide help?

107
0:05:36.47,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So let's consider first intervening at the level of learning itself --

108
0:05:39.896,000 --> 0:05:41,000
most commonly through school-based initiatives.

109
0:05:42.486,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, should we be encouraging teachers to focus on the kinds of skills

110
0:05:45.796,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that disadvantaged kids are most likely to struggle with?

111
0:05:48.794,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Of course.

112
0:05:49.969,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The importance of high-quality education based in scientific evidence

113
0:05:53.261,000 --> 0:05:54,000
really can't be overstated.

114
0:05:54.719,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And there are a number of examples of excellent interventions

115
0:05:57.601,000 --> 0:05:59,000
targeting things like literacy or self-regulation

116
0:06:00.053,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that do in fact improve kids' cognitive development and their test scores.

117
0:06:04.647,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But as any intervention scientist doing this work would tell you,

118
0:06:08.208,000 --> 0:06:09,000
this work is challenging.

119
0:06:09.598,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's hard to implement high-quality, evidence-based education.

120
0:06:12.847,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And it can be labor-intensive,

121
0:06:14.321,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it's sometimes costly.

122
0:06:16.778,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And in many cases, these disparities in child development emerge early --

123
0:06:20.635,000 --> 0:06:22,000
well before the start of formal schooling --

124
0:06:22.761,000 --> 0:06:24,000
sometimes when kids are just toddlers.

125
0:06:25.582,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so I would argue:

126
0:06:27.028,000 --> 0:06:28,000
school is very important,

127
0:06:29.004,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but if we're focusing all of our policy efforts

128
0:06:32.134,000 --> 0:06:33,000
on formal schooling,

129
0:06:33.733,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we're probably starting too late.

130
0:06:36.969,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So what about taking a step back

131
0:06:39.119,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and focusing on trying to change children's experiences?

132
0:06:42.685,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What particular experiences are associated with growing up in poverty

133
0:06:46.06,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and might be able to be targeted to promote brain development

134
0:06:48.949,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and learning outcomes for kids?

135
0:06:50.957,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Of course, there are many, right?

136
0:06:52.952,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Nutrition, access to health care,

137
0:06:56.179,000 --> 0:06:59,000
exposure to second-hand smoke or lead,

138
0:06:59.612,000 --> 0:07:01,000
experience of stress or discrimination,

139
0:07:01.761,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to name a few.

140
0:07:03.653,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In my laboratory,

141
0:07:04.827,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we're particularly focused on a few types of experiences

142
0:07:07.713,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that we believe may be able to be targeted

143
0:07:10.406,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to promote children's brain development

144
0:07:12.454,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and ultimately improve their learning outcomes.

145
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
As one example,

146
0:07:16.334,000 --> 0:07:19,000
take something I'll call the home language environment,

147
0:07:19.607,000 --> 0:07:22,000
by which I mean, we know that the number of words kids hear

148
0:07:23.266,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the number of conversations they're engaged in every day

149
0:07:26.1,000 --> 0:07:27,000
can vary tremendously.

150
0:07:28.067,000 --> 0:07:29,000
By some estimates,

151
0:07:29.375,000 --> 0:07:31,000
kids from more advantaged backgrounds

152
0:07:31.656,000 --> 0:07:34,000
hear an average of 30 million more spoken words

153
0:07:34.816,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in the first few years of life

154
0:07:36.517,000 --> 0:07:38,000
compared to kids from less advantaged backgrounds.

155
0:07:39.745,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, in our work, we're finding

156
0:07:41.309,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that kids who experience more back-and-forth,

157
0:07:44.254,000 --> 0:07:46,000
responsive conversational turns

158
0:07:46.505,000 --> 0:07:49,000
tend to have a larger brain surface in parts of the brain

159
0:07:49.892,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that we know are responsible for language and reading skills.

160
0:07:53.52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And in fact, the number of conversations they hear

161
0:07:55.878,000 --> 0:07:58,000
seems to matter a little bit more than the sheer number of words they hear.

162
0:08:00.432,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So one tantalizing possibility

163
0:08:02.408,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is that we should be teaching parents not just to talk a lot,

164
0:08:05.408,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but to actually have more conversations with their children.

165
0:08:08.752,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In this way, it's possible that we'll promote brain development

166
0:08:11.729,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and perhaps their kids' language and reading skills.

167
0:08:15.03,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And in fact, a number of scientists are testing

168
0:08:17.255,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that exciting possibility right now.

169
0:08:20.055,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But of course, we all know

170
0:08:21.329,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that growing up in poverty is associated with lots of different experiences

171
0:08:24.888,000 --> 0:08:26,000
beyond just how many conversations kids are having.

172
0:08:27.347,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So how do we choose what else to focus on?

173
0:08:30.679,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The list can be overwhelming.

174
0:08:32.79,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There are a number of high-quality interventions

175
0:08:35.176,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that do try to change children's experience,

176
0:08:37.442,000 --> 0:08:38,000
many of which are quite effective.

177
0:08:39.733,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But again, just like school-based initiatives,

178
0:08:41.9,000 --> 0:08:42,000
this is hard work.

179
0:08:43.104,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It can be challenging,

180
0:08:44.39,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it can be labor-intensive,

181
0:08:45.902,000 --> 0:08:47,000
sometimes costly ...

182
0:08:48.548,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and on occasion,

183
0:08:49.857,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it can be somewhat patronizing for scientists to swoop in

184
0:08:52.844,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and tell a family what they need to change in order for their child to succeed.

185
0:08:57.619,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So I want to share an idea with you.

186
0:09:01.639,000 --> 0:09:04,000
What if we tried to help young children in poverty

187
0:09:05.088,000 --> 0:09:07,000
by simply giving their families more money?

188
0:09:10.027,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I'm privileged to be working with a team of economists,

189
0:09:12.623,000 --> 0:09:14,000
social policy experts and neuroscientists

190
0:09:14.732,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in leading Baby's First Years,

191
0:09:16.949,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the first-ever randomized study

192
0:09:19.169,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to test whether poverty reduction causes changes in children's brain development.

193
0:09:25.846,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, the ambition of the study is large,

194
0:09:27.952,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but the premise is actually quite simple.

195
0:09:30.626,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In May of 2018,

196
0:09:31.8,000 --> 0:09:35,000
we began recruiting 1,000 mothers living below the federal poverty line

197
0:09:35.865,000 --> 0:09:38,000
shortly after they gave birth in a number of American hospitals.

198
0:09:40.076,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Upon enrolling in our study,

199
0:09:41.697,000 --> 0:09:45,000
all mothers receive an unconditional monthly cash gift

200
0:09:45.883,000 --> 0:09:48,000
for the first 40 months of their children's lives,

201
0:09:48.927,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and they're free to use this money however they like.

202
0:09:52.73,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But importantly, mothers are being randomized,

203
0:09:55.609,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so some mothers are randomized to receive a nominal monthly cash gift

204
0:10:00.273,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and others are randomized to receive several hundred dollars each month,

205
0:10:04.737,000 --> 0:10:05,000
an amount that we believe is large enough

206
0:10:06.734,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to make a difference in their day-to-day lives,

207
0:10:08.949,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in most cases increasing their monthly income by 20 to 25 percent.

208
0:10:13.357,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So in this way,

209
0:10:14.799,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we're hoping to finally move past questions

210
0:10:17.359,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of how poverty is correlated with child development

211
0:10:21.067,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and actually be able to test whether reducing poverty causes changes

212
0:10:25.775,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in children's cognitive, emotional and brain development

213
0:10:28.925,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in the first three years of life --

214
0:10:31.097,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the very time when we believe

215
0:10:32.502,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the developing brain may be most malleable to experience.

216
0:10:37.179,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now, we won't have definitive results from this study for several years,

217
0:10:41.031,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and if nothing else,

218
0:10:42.605,000 --> 0:10:45,000
1,000 newborns and their moms will have a bit more cash each month

219
0:10:45.725,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that they tell us they very much need.

220
0:10:48.106,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But what if it turns out that a cost-effective way

221
0:10:51.928,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to help young children in poverty

222
0:10:54.338,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is to simply give their moms more money?

223
0:10:58.982,000 --> 0:10:59,000
If our hypotheses are borne out,

224
0:11:00.957,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's our hope that results from this work will inform debates about social services

225
0:11:05.158,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that have the potential to effect millions of families with young children.

226
0:11:09.84,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Because while income may not be the only or even the most important factor

227
0:11:13.654,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in determining children's brain development,

228
0:11:16.217,000 --> 0:11:17,000
it may be one that,

229
0:11:17.484,000 --> 0:11:18,000
from a policy perspective,

230
0:11:19.427,000 --> 0:11:2,000
can be easily addressed.

231
0:11:22.327,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Put simply,

232
0:11:23.74,000 --> 0:11:28,000
if we can show that reducing poverty changes how children's brains develop

233
0:11:28.867,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and that leads to meaningful policy changes,

234
0:11:32.198,000 --> 0:11:35,000
then a young child born into poverty today

235
0:11:35.286,000 --> 0:11:38,000
may have a much better shot at a brighter future.

236
0:11:39.559,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you.

237
0:11:40.734,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

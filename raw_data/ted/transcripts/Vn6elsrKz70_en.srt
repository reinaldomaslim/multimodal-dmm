1
0:00:12.857,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to start by telling you two things about myself

2
0:00:15.524,000 --> 0:00:17,000
before I get into the full talk.

3
0:00:18.04,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And the first is that I've been writing about manners and civility

4
0:00:21.208,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for more than 20 years,

5
0:00:22.403,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as a book author and as a magazine columnist.

6
0:00:25.902,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The second is,

7
0:00:27.696,000 --> 0:00:31,000
my friends know to be very wary of inviting me over for dinner

8
0:00:32.554,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because any faux pas that happens at the table

9
0:00:34.888,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is likely to wind up in print.

10
0:00:36.563,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:37.681,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So, I'm watching, I can see back there and I can see through the portals, too.

12
0:00:41.506,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:43.855,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, speaking of dinner parties,

14
0:00:45.807,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I want to take you back to 2015 and a dinner party that I went to.

15
0:00:51.395,000 --> 0:00:52,000
To place this in time,

16
0:00:53.101,000 --> 0:00:56,000
this was when Caitlyn Jenner was first coming out,

17
0:00:56.23,000 --> 0:00:58,000
shedding her identity as a Kardashian

18
0:00:58.833,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and moving into her life as a transgender activist.

19
0:01:02.23,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wrote a column in People magazine at the time,

20
0:01:04.598,000 --> 0:01:05,000
talking about the importance of names

21
0:01:06.585,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and how names are our identity.

22
0:01:09.784,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that to misuse them or not to use them erases us in a certain way.

23
0:01:13.792,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And especially with Caitlyn Jenner,

24
0:01:15.736,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I talked about Caitlyn, but also the use of her pronouns.

25
0:01:19.125,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Her pronouns.

26
0:01:20.744,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I'm at this dinner -- delicious, wonderful, fun --

27
0:01:23.411,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when my host goes on a rant about Caitlyn Jenner.

28
0:01:28.706,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And she is saying that it is disrespectful for Caitlyn Jenner

29
0:01:33.866,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to force her to use a new name and to use these new pronouns.

30
0:01:39.53,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She's not buying it,

31
0:01:40.737,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I'm listening, and because I do meditation,

32
0:01:43.895,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I took my sacred pause before I responded.

33
0:01:46.738,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:49.962,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I reminded her that when she got married,

35
0:01:52.343,000 --> 0:01:53,000
she changed her name,

36
0:01:54.129,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and that she took the name of her husband.

37
0:01:56.446,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And that's the name all of us now use.

38
0:01:59.466,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We don't use it just because it's her legal name,

39
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but we use it because it's respectful.

40
0:02:04.053,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Ditto for Miss Jenner.

41
0:02:06.268,000 --> 0:02:08,000
She didn't buy it and we didn't speak for years.

42
0:02:08.553,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:10.887,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So ...

44
0:02:13.538,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I am known as the Civilist.

45
0:02:15.847,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it's probably a word that you're not that familiar with.

46
0:02:20.053,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's not in common parlance

47
0:02:21.539,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it comes from the Latin and the French,

48
0:02:24.585,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and it means an individual who tries to live by a moral code,

49
0:02:28.68,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who is striving to be a good citizen.

50
0:02:31.863,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The word "civility" is derived from that,

51
0:02:34.49,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the original definition of civility

52
0:02:36.776,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is citizens willing to give of themselves for the good of the city,

53
0:02:40.958,000 --> 0:02:42,000
for the good of the commonwealth, for the larger good.

54
0:02:44.427,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So, in this talk,

55
0:02:45.609,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you're going to learn three new ways to be civil, I hope,

56
0:02:49.535,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and it will be according to the original definition of civility.

57
0:02:54.394,000 --> 0:02:55,000
My first problem is:

58
0:02:57.403,000 --> 0:02:58,000
civility is an obsolete word.

59
0:02:59.684,000 --> 0:03:01,000
My second problem is:

60
0:03:01.787,000 --> 0:03:03,000
civility has become a dirty word in this country.

61
0:03:04.708,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that is whether you lean right or whether you lean left.

62
0:03:08.41,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And in part, that's because modern usage equates civility with decorum,

63
0:03:13.792,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with formal politeness, formal behavior.

64
0:03:17.196,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We've gotten away from the idea of citizenship.

65
0:03:20.792,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So, let me start by talking a little bit about my friends on the right,

66
0:03:24.696,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who have conflated civility with what they call political correctness.

67
0:03:28.982,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And to them, callouts for civility

68
0:03:31.071,000 --> 0:03:35,000
are really very much like what George Orwell wrote in "1984" --

69
0:03:35.419,000 --> 0:03:36,000
he called it "newspeak."

70
0:03:37.188,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And this was an attempt to change the way we talk

71
0:03:40.704,000 --> 0:03:42,000
by forcibly changing the language that we use.

72
0:03:43.093,000 --> 0:03:46,000
To change our ideas by changing the meaning of words.

73
0:03:46.784,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I think my dinner host might have had some of that

74
0:03:50.141,000 --> 0:03:51,000
rattling around there.

75
0:03:53.577,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I first personally understood, though,

76
0:03:55.737,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the right's problem with civility

77
0:03:57.408,000 --> 0:03:59,000
when I wrote a column about then-candidate Donald Trump.

78
0:04:01.284,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And he had just said

79
0:04:03.323,000 --> 0:04:06,000
he did not have time for total political correctness,

80
0:04:07.077,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and he did not believe the country did either.

81
0:04:09.34,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I took that to heart, it was very --

82
0:04:14.498,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The audience was very engaged about that online, as you can imagine.

83
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There was a thousand responses, and this one stood out to me

84
0:04:22.244,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because it was representative:

85
0:04:25.093,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Political correctness is a pathological system

86
0:04:28.363,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that lets liberals dominate a conversation,

87
0:04:30.831,000 --> 0:04:33,000
label, demonize and shout down the opposition."

88
0:04:35.228,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So I think, to the right, civility translates into censure.

89
0:04:41.117,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So that's the right.

90
0:04:43.211,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now, my friends on the left also have a problem with it.

91
0:04:47.323,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And for example, there have been those

92
0:04:49.174,000 --> 0:04:51,000
who have harassed Trump administration officials

93
0:04:51.585,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who support the President's border wall.

94
0:04:54.855,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They've been called out as rude, they've been called out as nasty,

95
0:04:58.054,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they've been called out as worse.

96
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And after one such incident last year,

97
0:05:01.936,000 --> 0:05:02,000
even the Washington Post --

98
0:05:03.834,000 --> 0:05:05,000
you know, left-leaning Washington Post --

99
0:05:05.916,000 --> 0:05:07,000
wrote an editorial and sided with decorum.

100
0:05:08.971,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And they argued that officials should be allowed to dine in peace.

101
0:05:13.828,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Hm.

102
0:05:15.574,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"You know, the wall is the real incivility here.

103
0:05:19.079,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The tear-gassing of kids, the separation of families."

104
0:05:22.595,000 --> 0:05:23,000
That's what the protestors say.

105
0:05:25.579,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And imagine if we had sided, in this country,

106
0:05:27.709,000 --> 0:05:3,000
with decorum and courtesy throughout our history.

107
0:05:31.306,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You know, I think about the suffragettes.

108
0:05:34.275,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They marched, they picketed.

109
0:05:37.101,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They were chastised, they were arrested

110
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for pursuing the vote for women in the 1920s.

111
0:05:42.934,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You know, I also think about the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.,

112
0:05:46.204,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the father of American nonviolent civil disobedience.

113
0:05:49.784,000 --> 0:05:54,000
He was labeled as uncivil in his attempt to promote racial and economic justice.

114
0:05:56.916,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So I think you get a sense

115
0:05:58.265,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of why civility has become a problem, a dirty word, here.

116
0:06:03.82,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, does this mean we can't disagree, that we can't speak our minds?

117
0:06:08.585,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Absolutely not.

118
0:06:10.775,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I recently spoke with Dr. Carolyn Lukensmeyer.

119
0:06:13.514,000 --> 0:06:15,000
She's kind of the guru of civility in this country,

120
0:06:16.371,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the executive director of a body

121
0:06:18.229,000 --> 0:06:2,000
called the National Institute for Civil Discourse.

122
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And she told me,

123
0:06:21.895,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Civility does not mean appeasement or avoiding important differences.

124
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It means listening and talking about those differences with respect."

125
0:06:32.696,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In a healthy democracy, we need to do that.

126
0:06:35.927,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I call that respectful engagement.

127
0:06:39.101,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But civil discourse also needs rules, it needs boundaries.

128
0:06:43.869,000 --> 0:06:45,000
For instance, there's a difference

129
0:06:46.163,000 --> 0:06:49,000
between language that is simply rude or demeaning,

130
0:06:49.528,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and speech that invokes hatred and intolerance.

131
0:06:53.117,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And specifically of groups.

132
0:06:55.053,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I'm thinking of racial and ethnic groups,

133
0:06:57.18,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'm thinking of the LGBTQ community,

134
0:06:59.403,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm thinking of the disabled.

135
0:07:02.523,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We snowflakes call this speech "hate speech."

136
0:07:06.318,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And hate speech can lead to violence.

137
0:07:11.048,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So, to that point, in the fall of 2018,

138
0:07:14.737,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I wrote a column about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.

139
0:07:18.269,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You may remember her,

140
0:07:19.507,000 --> 0:07:23,000
she was one of the women who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh

141
0:07:24.039,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of sexual assault.

142
0:07:25.737,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And among the responses,

143
0:07:27.236,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I received this message, a personal message,

144
0:07:30.968,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which you can see here on the slide.

145
0:07:33.309,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's been largely redacted.

146
0:07:35.079,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:36.323,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This message was 50 words long. 10 of them were the f-bomb.

148
0:07:40.498,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And the Democrats were called out, President Obama was called out,

149
0:07:44.202,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and I was referred to in a pretty darn vulgar and coarse way.

150
0:07:51.258,000 --> 0:07:53,000
There was an explicit threat in that message,

151
0:07:53.704,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and that is why my editors at The Post sent it to authorities.

152
0:07:58.108,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This came shortly before the pipe bombs were sent to other media outlets,

153
0:08:01.728,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so everybody was really kind of on guard there.

154
0:08:06.252,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And the larger context was, only a few months before,

155
0:08:09.236,000 --> 0:08:11,000
five staffers had been killed at a Maryland newspaper.

156
0:08:11.839,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They had been shot dead by a reader with a grudge.

157
0:08:16.174,000 --> 0:08:17,000
"Shut up or else."

158
0:08:20.34,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And it was around that same time

159
0:08:23.158,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that a different reader of mine started stalking me online.

160
0:08:26.308,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And at first, it was ...

161
0:08:28.737,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'll call it light and fluffy.

162
0:08:30.194,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It was around this time last year

163
0:08:31.809,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and I still had my Christmas decorations up

164
0:08:33.896,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and he sent me a message saying,

165
0:08:35.895,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"You should take your Christmas decorations down."

166
0:08:38.616,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And then he noticed that my dog was off leash one day,

167
0:08:41.342,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and then he commented that I had gone to the market.

168
0:08:45.576,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And then he wrote me one that said,

169
0:08:48.115,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"If anyone were to shoot and kill you,

170
0:08:50.352,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it would not be a loss at all."

171
0:08:54.45,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I wish that were the end of the story.

172
0:08:56.458,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Because then, a few months later, he came to my door, my front door,

173
0:08:59.734,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in a rage and tried to break the door down.

174
0:09:02.206,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I now own mace, a security system

175
0:09:05.174,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.

176
0:09:08.792,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Sighs)

177
0:09:10.539,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Shut up or else."

178
0:09:12.935,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So, what's to be done

179
0:09:14.133,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to forestall civility from turning ugly, from turning violent?

180
0:09:17.887,000 --> 0:09:19,000
My first rule is to deescalate language.

181
0:09:20.062,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I've stopped using trigger words in print.

182
0:09:24.332,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And by trigger words, I mean "homophobe," I mean "racist,"

183
0:09:27.319,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I mean "xenophobe," I mean "sexist."

184
0:09:30.165,000 --> 0:09:31,000
All of those words.

185
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They set people off.

186
0:09:34.561,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They're incendiary

187
0:09:35.737,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and they do not allow us to find common ground.

188
0:09:38.268,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They do not allow us to find a common heart.

189
0:09:41.553,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And so to this point, when John McCain died in 2018,

190
0:09:47.196,000 --> 0:09:5,000
his supporters noted that he never made personal attacks.

191
0:09:51.448,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But his opponents agreed as well,

192
0:09:53.131,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I though that was what was really noteworthy.

193
0:09:55.448,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He challenged people's policies, he challenged their positions,

194
0:09:58.448,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but he never made it personal.

195
0:10:00.289,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And so that's the second rule.

196
0:10:03.275,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So the problem of civility is not only an American one.

197
0:10:07.504,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In the Netherlands, there are calls for a civility offensive right now,

198
0:10:11.338,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and as one Dutch philosopher has put it,

199
0:10:13.701,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the country has fallen under a spell of "verhuftering."

200
0:10:17.614,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now, this is not a word that I knew before and I did quite a bit of research.

201
0:10:21.9,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It loosely means bullying and the disappearance of good manners.

202
0:10:26.552,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It actually means much worse than that, but that's what I'm saying here.

203
0:10:31.228,000 --> 0:10:34,000
When you have a specific word, though, to describe a problem like that,

204
0:10:34.878,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you know you really have a problem.

205
0:10:38.196,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And in the United Kingdom, the [2016] Brexit vote ...

206
0:10:42.838,000 --> 0:10:45,000
you know, has divided a nation even more so.

207
0:10:47.331,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And one critic of the breakup called those who favor it --

208
0:10:51.133,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I just love this phrase --

209
0:10:53.006,000 --> 0:10:55,000
"the frightened parochial lizard brain of Britain."

210
0:10:56.417,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The frightened parochial lizard brain of Britain.

211
0:10:59.212,000 --> 0:11:,000
That's personal.

212
0:11:01.22,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And it makes me miss "Downton Abbey"

213
0:11:04.6,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and its patina of civility.

214
0:11:08.871,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But therein lies the third rule:

215
0:11:11.204,000 --> 0:11:13,000
don't mistake decorum for civility.

216
0:11:14.165,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Even if you have a dowager countess as fabulous as Dame Maggie Smith.

217
0:11:18.006,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

218
0:11:19.038,000 --> 0:11:2,000
[Don't be defeatist. It's so middle class.]

219
0:11:20.982,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So let me end with one last story.

220
0:11:23.609,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Not that long ago, I was at a bakery, and they make these amazing scones.

221
0:11:27.321,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So, long line -- there are a lot of scones.

222
0:11:29.637,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And one by one, the scones were disappearing

223
0:11:31.757,000 --> 0:11:33,000
until there was one woman in between me and that last scone.

224
0:11:34.614,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

225
0:11:36.315,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Praise the Lord, she said, "I'll have a croissant."

226
0:11:39.081,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:40.339,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So when it became my turn, I said, "I'll take that scone."

228
0:11:44.814,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The guy behind me --

229
0:11:46.37,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I'd never turned around, never seen him --

230
0:11:48.886,000 --> 0:11:49,000
he shouted, "That's my scone!

231
0:11:51.291,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes."

232
0:11:53.156,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And I was like, "Who are you?

233
0:11:55.707,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes, and you're behind me."

234
0:11:58.776,000 --> 0:12:,000
So, I grew up here in New York,

235
0:12:01.259,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and went to high school not that far from here.

236
0:12:03.649,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I may seem, you know, very civil here and so on,

237
0:12:07.339,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but I can hip check anybody for a taxicab in this room, on these streets.

238
0:12:12.985,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So I was surprised when I said to this guy ...

239
0:12:16.398,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"Would you like half?"

240
0:12:18.025,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"Would you like half?"

241
0:12:19.482,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I didn't think about it, it just came out.

242
0:12:22.006,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And then, he was very puzzled, and I could see his face change

243
0:12:25.101,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and he said to me,

244
0:12:26.315,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"Well, how about if I buy another pastry and we'll share both of them?"

245
0:12:30.665,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And he did, and we did.

246
0:12:33.577,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And we sat and talked.

247
0:12:35.539,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We had nothing in common.

248
0:12:37.237,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:38.642,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We had nothing in common: nationality, sexual orientation, occupation.

250
0:12:43.332,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But through this moment of kindness, through this moment of connection,

251
0:12:47.729,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we developed a friendship, we have stayed in touch.

252
0:12:50.142,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Laughter)

253
0:12:51.316,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Although he was appalled to learn that I'm called the Civilist after that.

254
0:12:54.832,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:56.474,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But I call this the joy of civility.

256
0:12:59.276,000 --> 0:13:,000
The joy of civility.

257
0:13:00.466,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And it led me to wonder,

258
0:13:01.832,000 --> 0:13:04,000
what is the good we forgo, not just the trouble we avoid,

259
0:13:05.061,000 --> 0:13:06,000
when we choose to be uncivil.

260
0:13:07.958,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And by good, I mean friendship, I mean connection.

261
0:13:11.161,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I mean sharing 1000 calories.

262
0:13:14.336,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But I also mean it in a larger way.

263
0:13:16.36,000 --> 0:13:19,000
You know, as communities and as a country and as a world.

264
0:13:20.233,000 --> 0:13:21,000
What are we missing out on?

265
0:13:22.989,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So, today, we are engaged in a great civil war of ideas and identity.

266
0:13:27.91,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And we have no rules for them.

267
0:13:30.886,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You know, there are rules for war.

268
0:13:33.618,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Think about the Geneva Conventions.

269
0:13:35.341,000 --> 0:13:37,000
They ensure that every soldier is treated humanely,

270
0:13:37.817,000 --> 0:13:38,000
on and off the battlefield.

271
0:13:41.372,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So, frankly, I think we need a Geneva Convention of civility,

272
0:13:44.434,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to set the rules for discourse for the parameters of that.

273
0:13:47.776,000 --> 0:13:51,000
To help us become better citizens of our communities and of our countries.

274
0:13:53.395,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And if I have anything to say about it,

275
0:13:55.292,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I would base those rules on the original definition of civility,

276
0:13:59.093,000 --> 0:14:01,000
from the Latin and from the French.

277
0:14:01.236,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Civility:

278
0:14:03.006,000 --> 0:14:06,000
citizens willing to give of themselves for the greater good.

279
0:14:07.526,000 --> 0:14:08,000
For the good of the city.

280
0:14:09.811,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So I think civility, with that understanding, is not a dirty word.

281
0:14:13.534,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And I hope the civilist will not become, or will not stay, obsolete.

282
0:14:19.667,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

283
0:14:20.849,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.788,000 --> 0:00:13,000
To kick the bucket,

3
0:00:14.578,000 --> 0:00:15,000
bite the dust,

4
0:00:16.289,000 --> 0:00:18,000
cash in your chips,

5
0:00:18.436,000 --> 0:00:2,000
check out, depart, expire,

6
0:00:21.426,000 --> 0:00:22,000
launch into eternity ...

7
0:00:24.359,000 --> 0:00:27,000
These are all euphemisms we use in humor

8
0:00:27.566,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to describe the one life event we are all going to experience:

9
0:00:32.597,000 --> 0:00:33,000
death.

10
0:00:34.759,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But most of us don't want to acknowledge death,

11
0:00:37.77,000 --> 0:00:38,000
we don't want to plan for it,

12
0:00:39.668,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and we don't want to discuss it with the most important people in our lives.

13
0:00:44.551,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I grew up in an Australian community where people got old or sick

14
0:00:47.706,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and passed away,

15
0:00:48.881,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and only the adults attended the funeral.

16
0:00:51.495,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My parents would come home looking sad and drained,

17
0:00:54.075,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but they didn't discuss it with us.

18
0:00:56.306,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So I was ignorant to death and of the grieving process.

19
0:01:01.021,000 --> 0:01:03,000
At 15, I got my invitation.

20
0:01:03.872,000 --> 0:01:05,000
A dear neighbor who was like an aunt to me

21
0:01:06.254,000 --> 0:01:07,000
died suddenly of a heart attack,

22
0:01:08.127,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I attended my first funeral and did my first reading.

23
0:01:12.122,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I didn't know the tightness in my chest and the dryness in my mouth was normal.

24
0:01:18.376,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The celebrant got some of the facts wrong, and it made me really angry.

25
0:01:23.027,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He talked about how she loved knitting.

26
0:01:28.239,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Knitting.

27
0:01:29.414,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:30.732,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He didn't mention that, at 75, she still mowed her own lawn,

29
0:01:34.816,000 --> 0:01:36,000
built an amazing fish pond in her front yard

30
0:01:36.967,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and made her own ginger beer.

31
0:01:39.39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I'm pretty sure "keen knitter"

32
0:01:41.915,000 --> 0:01:43,000
isn't what she would have chosen for her eulogy.

33
0:01:44.255,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:46.262,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I believe if we discuss death as part of day-to-day living,

35
0:01:49.587,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we give ourselves the opportunity to reflect on our core values,

36
0:01:52.969,000 --> 0:01:53,000
share them with our loved ones,

37
0:01:54.938,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and then our survivors can make informed decisions

38
0:01:58.626,000 --> 0:02:01,000
without fear or regret of having failed to honor our legacy.

39
0:02:04.316,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I am blessed to lead a wonderful, culturally diverse team,

40
0:02:08.062,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and in the last 12 months,

41
0:02:09.746,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we've lost five parents,

42
0:02:11.889,000 --> 0:02:13,000
including my own father,

43
0:02:13.928,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and most recently, a former colleague who died at 41 from bowel cancer.

44
0:02:19.392,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We started having open and frank conversations

45
0:02:21.69,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about what we were experiencing.

46
0:02:24.027,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We talked about the practical stuff,

47
0:02:26.511,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the stuff no one prepares you for:

48
0:02:29.098,000 --> 0:02:31,000
dealing with government agencies,

49
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
hospitals, nursing homes,

50
0:02:33.238,000 --> 0:02:34,000
advanced care directives,

51
0:02:34.9,000 --> 0:02:35,000
funeral directors

52
0:02:36.357,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and extended family members,

53
0:02:39.079,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:40.676,000 --> 0:02:42,000
making decisions about coffins,

55
0:02:43.086,000 --> 0:02:44,000
headstones,

56
0:02:44.368,000 --> 0:02:45,000
headstone wording,

57
0:02:45.874,000 --> 0:02:46,000
headstone font size,

58
0:02:47.844,000 --> 0:02:48,000
all while sleep-deprived.

59
0:02:50.834,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We also discussed some of the issues

60
0:02:52.732,000 --> 0:02:54,000
triggered by our various cultural backgrounds,

61
0:02:55.318,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and we realized there can be some significant differences

62
0:02:58.048,000 --> 0:03:,000
in how we honor the passing of a loved one.

63
0:03:01.504,000 --> 0:03:03,000
A great example of this is "Sorry Business,"

64
0:03:04.235,000 --> 0:03:06,000
practiced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

65
0:03:07.895,000 --> 0:03:09,000
During Sorry Business,

66
0:03:10.004,000 --> 0:03:13,000
family members will take on specific roles and responsibilities,

67
0:03:13.789,000 --> 0:03:15,000
protocols such as limiting the use of photographs,

68
0:03:16.654,000 --> 0:03:18,000
saying the name of the deceased,

69
0:03:19.011,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and holding a smoking ceremony

70
0:03:21.25,000 --> 0:03:25,000
are all a sign of respect and allow for a peaceful transition of the spirit.

71
0:03:26.642,000 --> 0:03:27,000
These customs can be a complete contrast

72
0:03:28.626,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to those we might practice in Western cultures,

73
0:03:31.118,000 --> 0:03:33,000
where we would honor the memory of a loved one

74
0:03:33.309,000 --> 0:03:35,000
by talking about them and sharing photographs.

75
0:03:37.312,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So my lesson from this last year is,

76
0:03:39.906,000 --> 0:03:44,000
life would be a lot easier to live if we talked about death now,

77
0:03:45.074,000 --> 0:03:46,000
while we're healthy.

78
0:03:47.066,000 --> 0:03:5,000
For most of us, we wait until we are too emotional,

79
0:03:50.697,000 --> 0:03:51,000
too ill

80
0:03:52.221,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or too physically exhausted --

81
0:03:55.269,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and then it's too late.

82
0:03:57.933,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Isn't it time we started taking ownership of our finale on this earth?

83
0:04:03.06,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So let's get going.

84
0:04:05.581,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Do you know what you want when you die?

85
0:04:08.231,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Do you know how you want to be remembered?

86
0:04:10.834,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Is location important?

87
0:04:13.005,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Do you want to be near the ocean

88
0:04:15.226,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or in the ocean?

89
0:04:16.776,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:18.793,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Do you want a religious service or an informal party,

91
0:04:22.15,000 --> 0:04:24,000
or do you want to go out with a bang,

92
0:04:24.643,000 --> 0:04:26,000
literally, in a firework?

93
0:04:27.017,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:28.755,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When it comes to death, there's so much to discuss,

95
0:04:31.175,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but I want to focus on two aspects:

96
0:04:33.436,000 --> 0:04:38,000
why talking about and planning your death can help you experience a good death,

97
0:04:39.055,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and then reduce the stress on your loved ones;

98
0:04:41.548,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and how talking about death can help us support those who are grieving.

99
0:04:45.876,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So let's start with planning.

100
0:04:48.241,000 --> 0:04:49,000
How many of you have a will?

101
0:04:50.146,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Put your hand up.

102
0:04:51.898,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Oh, this is fantastic.

103
0:04:53.996,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In Australia, 45 percent of adults over the age of 18

104
0:04:58.203,000 --> 0:04:59,000
do not have a legal will.

105
0:05:01.133,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You're a little bit above average.

106
0:05:03.831,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is a startling statistic

107
0:05:06.201,000 --> 0:05:09,000
given that writing a will can actually be quite simple and inexpensive.

108
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So I started asking my friends and neighbors

109
0:05:12.87,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and was really surprised to learn many of them don't have a will,

110
0:05:16.101,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and some couples don't realize they need individual wills.

111
0:05:19.627,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The usual explanation was, well, it's all going to go to my partner anyway.

112
0:05:24.667,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So keep in mind that laws vary

113
0:05:26.518,000 --> 0:05:28,000
from state to state and country to country,

114
0:05:29.359,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but this is what happens in New South Wales

115
0:05:31.541,000 --> 0:05:33,000
if you die without leaving a legal will.

116
0:05:35.621,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Firstly, a suitable administrator must be appointed

117
0:05:38.843,000 --> 0:05:4,000
by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

118
0:05:41.854,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Chances are this is someone who would never have met the deceased.

119
0:05:45.814,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That person is then responsible for arranging your funeral,

120
0:05:49.249,000 --> 0:05:52,000
collecting assets and distributing them after paying debts and taxes.

121
0:05:54.042,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And one of those debts will be the bill for their services.

122
0:05:57.462,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is not someone who would have known

123
0:05:59.391,000 --> 0:06:01,000
you want the four-foot wooden giraffe in your living room

124
0:06:02.082,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to go to the person who helped you carry it halfway across the world,

125
0:06:05.561,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and yes, that's in my will.

126
0:06:07.898,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:10.251,000 --> 0:06:12,000
If you die leaving a spouse or a domestic partner,

128
0:06:12.963,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then chances are they will receive your estate,

129
0:06:15.806,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but if you are single, it's far more complicated,

130
0:06:18.75,000 --> 0:06:22,000
as parents, siblings, half-siblings and dependents all come into play.

131
0:06:24.101,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And did you know that if you make a regular donation to charity,

132
0:06:28.479,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that charity may have grounds to make a claim on your estate?

133
0:06:32.511,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The most important thing to know is the bigger your estate,

134
0:06:35.808,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the more complicated that will will be,

135
0:06:37.722,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and the more expensive that bill.

136
0:06:40.882,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So if you don't have a will, I ask you ...

137
0:06:45.406,000 --> 0:06:46,000
when else in your life

138
0:06:47.426,000 --> 0:06:5,000
have you willingly given money to the government

139
0:06:50.591,000 --> 0:06:51,000
when you didn't have to?

140
0:06:52.053,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:55.682,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I lost my father in February to a progressive lung disease.

142
0:06:59.706,000 --> 0:07:,000
When dad knew his death was imminent,

143
0:07:01.53,000 --> 0:07:02,000
he had three clear wishes.

144
0:07:03.698,000 --> 0:07:05,000
He wanted to die at home;

145
0:07:06.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
he wanted to die surrounded by family;

146
0:07:08.593,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and he wanted to die peacefully, not choking or gasping for air.

147
0:07:13.008,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And I'm pleased to say that my family were able to support dad's wishes,

148
0:07:17.207,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and he achieved his goals,

149
0:07:18.838,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and in that sense, he had a good death.

150
0:07:22.444,000 --> 0:07:23,000
He had the death he planned for.

151
0:07:25.538,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Because dad wanted to die at home,

152
0:07:27.261,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we had to have some pretty tough conversations

153
0:07:29.429,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and fill out a lot of paperwork.

154
0:07:31.853,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The questions on the forms cover everything from resuscitation to organ donation.

155
0:07:37.282,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Dad said, "Take whatever organs you can use."

156
0:07:41.226,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This was upsetting to my mum,

157
0:07:43.313,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as my dad's health was deteriorating rapidly,

158
0:07:45.762,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it was no longer the right time to talk about organ donation.

159
0:07:50.912,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I believe we need to discuss these issues when we are fit and healthy,

160
0:07:54.222,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so we can take the emotion out of it,

161
0:07:56.694,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then we can learn not just what is important,

162
0:07:59.496,000 --> 0:08:,000
but why it's important.

163
0:08:02.269,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So as part of my journey,

164
0:08:04.753,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I started engaging my family and friends to find out their thoughts on death,

165
0:08:09.301,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and how they wanted to be remembered.

166
0:08:12.406,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I discovered you can host a "Death Over Dinner,"

167
0:08:16.763,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or a "Death Cafe,"

168
0:08:18.747,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which is a great, casual way to introduce the topic ...

169
0:08:21.531,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:23.588,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and gain some wonderful insight.

171
0:08:25.366,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:27.085,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Did you know that your body has to be legally disposed of,

173
0:08:30.768,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and you can't just be shoved off a cliff

174
0:08:33.356,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or set fire to in the backyard?

175
0:08:35.07,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:36.327,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In Australia, you have three options.

177
0:08:38.228,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The two most common are burial and cremation,

178
0:08:40.499,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but you can also donate your body to science.

179
0:08:43.562,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And I am pleased to report that innovation has touched

180
0:08:46.515,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the world of corpse disposal.

181
0:08:48.133,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:49.258,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You can now opt for an eco-funeral.

183
0:08:51.338,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You can be buried at the base of a tree

184
0:08:53.43,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in recycled cardboard or a wicker basket,

185
0:08:56.258,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and for those who love the ocean,

186
0:08:57.924,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there are eco-friendly urns that will dissolve at sea.

187
0:09:01.448,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Personally, I plan to be cremated,

188
0:09:04.203,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but given that I get seasick,

189
0:09:06.741,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I can think of nothing worse

190
0:09:08.576,000 --> 0:09:11,000
than having my ashes flung into a huge ocean swell.

191
0:09:12.735,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I've actually bought a plot in the rose garden next to my dad.

192
0:09:16.314,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I call it my investment property.

193
0:09:18.291,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:20.775,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But sadly, there's no tax deduction.

195
0:09:23.924,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:26.185,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So if you plan for your death,

197
0:09:29.558,000 --> 0:09:33,000
then your survivors will know how to experience a healthy bereavement

198
0:09:33.678,000 --> 0:09:36,000
without fear or guilt of having failed to honor your legacy.

199
0:09:37.866,000 --> 0:09:39,000
As part of my research, I've been to seminars,

200
0:09:40.557,000 --> 0:09:43,000
read books and talked to palliative care nurses.

201
0:09:43.627,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I've come to understand

202
0:09:44.982,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as a consequence of not talking about death,

203
0:09:48.325,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we don't know how to be around grief.

204
0:09:51.591,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And on the flip side, if we talk about death more,

205
0:09:54.834,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we will become more comfortable with the emotions we experience around grief.

206
0:10:01.556,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I discovered, this year,

207
0:10:03.351,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it's actually a privilege to help someone exit this life,

208
0:10:07.248,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and although my heart is heavy with loss and sadness,

209
0:10:11.135,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it is not heavy with regret.

210
0:10:13.524,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I knew what dad wanted,

211
0:10:15.541,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and I feel at peace knowing I could support his wishes.

212
0:10:21.057,000 --> 0:10:24,000
My dad's last 24 hours were in a peaceful coma,

213
0:10:24.722,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and after days of around-the-clock care,

214
0:10:26.754,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we had time to sit, hold his hand,

215
0:10:29.191,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and say goodbye.

216
0:10:31.494,000 --> 0:10:34,000
He passed away on a Monday morning just before breakfast,

217
0:10:34.907,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and after the doctor came

218
0:10:36.598,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and we waited for the funeral home,

219
0:10:39.238,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I went into the kitchen, and I ate a big bowl of porridge.

220
0:10:45.041,000 --> 0:10:48,000
When I told some of my friends this, they were really shocked.

221
0:10:48.947,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"How could you eat at a time like that?"

222
0:10:53.164,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Well, I was hungry.

223
0:10:56.097,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:00.811,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You see, grief impacted my sleep and my ability to concentrate,

225
0:11:04.788,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but it never impacted my stomach. I was always hungry.

226
0:11:08.063,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:09.271,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's different for all of us,

228
0:11:10.905,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and it's really important that we acknowledge that.

229
0:11:14.698,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So if we don't talk about our death and the death of loved ones,

230
0:11:17.873,000 --> 0:11:21,000
how can we possibly support a friend, a colleague, a neighbor

231
0:11:22.028,000 --> 0:11:23,000
who is grieving?

232
0:11:23.669,000 --> 0:11:26,000
How do we support someone who has lost someone suddenly,

233
0:11:26.702,000 --> 0:11:27,000
like an accident or suicide?

234
0:11:29.685,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We tend to avoid them ...

235
0:11:32.359,000 --> 0:11:34,000
not because we don't care,

236
0:11:34.844,000 --> 0:11:35,000
because we don't know what to say.

237
0:11:37.912,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We know as a friend we can't fix it,

238
0:11:40.588,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we can't take away that pain,

239
0:11:43.207,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so we say things to fill that awkward silence,

240
0:11:46.422,000 --> 0:11:47,000
sometimes things we regret saying.

241
0:11:49.532,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Examples would be:

242
0:11:53.158,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"At least he isn't suffering anymore."

243
0:11:56.673,000 --> 0:11:57,000
"At least you've got your memories."

244
0:12:00.215,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"At least you don't have to pay for hospital parking anymore."

245
0:12:03.159,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:05.279,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Really, we don't need to say anything.

247
0:12:08.588,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We just need to be.

248
0:12:11.211,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Be patient,

249
0:12:13.079,000 --> 0:12:15,000
be understanding,

250
0:12:15.285,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and be a listener.

251
0:12:17.672,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And if you can't be any of those things,

252
0:12:20.93,000 --> 0:12:24,000
then please, be the person who makes the lasagna, the curry or the casserole,

253
0:12:25.165,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because your offerings will be greatly appreciated.

254
0:12:27.649,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:29.686,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I've been to 10 funerals in the last year,

256
0:12:32.052,000 --> 0:12:33,000
one of which I helped arrange.

257
0:12:34.046,000 --> 0:12:36,000
They ran the full gamut:

258
0:12:36.288,000 --> 0:12:38,000
a very solemn Greek Orthodox service,

259
0:12:38.773,000 --> 0:12:4,000
four Catholic requiem masses

260
0:12:41.408,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and a garden party

261
0:12:43.091,000 --> 0:12:47,000
where I made a toast while scattering my friend's ashes around her garden

262
0:12:47.552,000 --> 0:12:48,000
with a soup ladle.

263
0:12:48.901,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:50.451,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I have carried, kissed, written on and toasted coffins with a shot of ouzo.

265
0:12:55.783,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I have worn all black,

266
0:12:57.383,000 --> 0:12:59,000
all color and a party dress.

267
0:13:00.184,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Despite the vast differences in sendoff,

268
0:13:02.493,000 --> 0:13:04,000
despite me being at times out of my comfort zone

269
0:13:05.039,000 --> 0:13:07,000
doing something I've never done before,

270
0:13:07.905,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I drew comfort from one thing --

271
0:13:10.889,000 --> 0:13:12,000
knowing that this is what each person would have wanted.

272
0:13:15.187,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So what do I want?

273
0:13:17.218,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well, I like to be organized, so I have the will,

274
0:13:21.234,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I'm a registered organ donor, and I have my investment property.

275
0:13:25.186,000 --> 0:13:27,000
All that is left is planning my sendoff,

276
0:13:27.941,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a big party, lots of champagne,

277
0:13:31.306,000 --> 0:13:34,000
color, laughter, and of course, music to remember me by.

278
0:13:35.496,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

279
0:13:36.671,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

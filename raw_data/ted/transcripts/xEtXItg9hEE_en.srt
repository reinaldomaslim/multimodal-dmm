2
0:00:16.025,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So let me start by taking you back,

3
0:00:19.627,000 --> 0:00:21,000
back into the mists of your memory

4
0:00:21.863,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,

5
0:00:25.376,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but certainly the most anticipated year

6
0:00:28.012,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in all human history:

7
0:00:29.99,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the year 2000. Remember that?

8
0:00:32.928,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Y2K, the dotcom bubble,

9
0:00:36.481,000 --> 0:00:38,000
stressing about whose party you're going to go to

10
0:00:38.878,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as the clock strikes midnight,

11
0:00:41.1,000 --> 0:00:43,000
before the champagne goes flat,

12
0:00:43.142,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and then there's that inchoate yearning

13
0:00:46.461,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,

14
0:00:49.7,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that the year 2000, should mean more,

15
0:00:52.216,000 --> 0:00:55,000
more than just a two and some zeroes.

16
0:00:55.435,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders

17
0:00:59.193,000 --> 0:01:01,000
actually lived up to that millennium moment

18
0:01:01.815,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and back in 2000 agreed to some

19
0:01:03.964,000 --> 0:01:05,000
pretty extraordinary stuff:

20
0:01:06.371,000 --> 0:01:09,000
visionary, measurable, long-term targets

21
0:01:09.817,000 --> 0:01:11,000
called the Millennium Development Goals.

22
0:01:12.55,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals

23
0:01:14.795,000 --> 0:01:16,000
under your pillow, or by the bedside table,

24
0:01:17.577,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but just in case you don't,

25
0:01:19.663,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and your memory needs some jogging,

26
0:01:21.493,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the deal agreed then goes like this:

27
0:01:24.115,000 --> 0:01:26,000
developing countries promised to at least halve

28
0:01:26.69,000 --> 0:01:29,000
extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,

29
0:01:30.088,000 --> 0:01:32,000
alongside some other targets, by 2015,

30
0:01:32.868,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and developed nations promised to help them

31
0:01:35.723,000 --> 0:01:37,000
get that done by dropping debts,

32
0:01:38.121,000 --> 0:01:4,000
increasing smart aid, and trade reform.

33
0:01:40.842,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well, we're approaching 2015,

34
0:01:43.091,000 --> 0:01:45,000
so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?

35
0:01:45.89,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?

36
0:01:49.652,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide

37
0:01:52.891,000 --> 0:01:55,000
what we want to do on these goals going forward.

38
0:01:56.124,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What does the world want to do together?

39
0:01:58.303,000 --> 0:02:,000
We've got to decide a process by which we decide.

40
0:02:00.826,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on

41
0:02:03.724,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.

42
0:02:07.525,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Incredible partnerships between the private sector,

43
0:02:10.642,000 --> 0:02:12,000
political leaders, philanthropists

44
0:02:12.846,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and amazing grassroots activists

45
0:02:14.875,000 --> 0:02:15,000
across the developing world,

46
0:02:16.604,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but also 250,000 people marched in the streets

47
0:02:21.138,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of Edinburgh outside this very building

48
0:02:23.574,000 --> 0:02:24,000
for Make Poverty History.

49
0:02:24.918,000 --> 0:02:26,000
All together, they achieved these results:

50
0:02:27.609,000 --> 0:02:3,000
increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,

51
0:02:30.701,000 --> 0:02:32,000
life-saving anti-AIDS drugs;

52
0:02:32.874,000 --> 0:02:34,000
nearly halved deaths from malaria;

53
0:02:35.562,000 --> 0:02:39,000
vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.

54
0:02:40.324,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And combined, this is going to result

55
0:02:42.627,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in two million fewer children dying every year,

56
0:02:45.71,000 --> 0:02:47,000
last year, than in the year 2000.

57
0:02:47.755,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,

58
0:02:50.69,000 --> 0:02:53,000
ten times you lot not dead every day,

59
0:02:54.234,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because of all of these partnerships.

60
0:02:56.216,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress

61
0:02:59.319,000 --> 0:03:,000
that more people should know about,

62
0:03:01.276,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news

63
0:03:03.683,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.

64
0:03:06.723,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,

65
0:03:09.241,000 --> 0:03:12,000
thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.

66
0:03:12.452,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But there's still a lot of unfinished business.

67
0:03:15.069,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,

68
0:03:19.671,000 --> 0:03:21,000
treatable diseases,

69
0:03:21.742,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and 178 million kids are malnourished

70
0:03:24.475,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to the point of stunting, a horrible term

71
0:03:25.905,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.

72
0:03:29.683,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.

73
0:03:32.171,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But then, a lot of people think there are things

74
0:03:35.219,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that should have been in the original package

75
0:03:37.132,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that weren't agreed back then that should now be included,

76
0:03:39.404,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like sustainable development targets,

77
0:03:41.934,000 --> 0:03:43,000
natural resource governance targets,

78
0:03:44.196,000 --> 0:03:46,000
access to opportunity, to knowledge,

79
0:03:46.391,000 --> 0:03:47,000
equity, fighting corruption.

80
0:03:48.381,000 --> 0:03:5,000
All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.

81
0:03:51.037,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But the key thing here is,

82
0:03:53.005,000 --> 0:03:55,000
what do you think should be in the new goals?

83
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What do you want?

84
0:03:57.032,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality

85
0:03:59.476,000 --> 0:04:,000
or education?

86
0:04:01.353,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Should those be in the new package of goals?

87
0:04:03.739,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And quite frankly, that's a good question,

88
0:04:05.753,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs

89
0:04:07.699,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and choices here, so you want to hope

90
0:04:09.655,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that the process by which the world decides

91
0:04:11.592,000 --> 0:04:14,000
these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?

92
0:04:14.831,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh,

93
0:04:16.857,000 --> 0:04:18,000
technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,

94
0:04:19.839,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with the best intentions, are busying themselves

95
0:04:22.302,000 --> 0:04:24,000
designing a new package of goals,

96
0:04:24.701,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old

97
0:04:28.021,000 --> 0:04:31,000
late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.

98
0:04:31.754,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,

99
0:04:35.556,000 --> 0:04:37,000
along with ubiquitous reality TV formats

100
0:04:38.298,000 --> 0:04:4,000
have spread all around the world.

101
0:04:40.415,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So what we'd like to propose is that we use them

102
0:04:43.199,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to involve people from all around the world

103
0:04:46.221,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in an historic first: the world's first truly global

104
0:04:49.99,000 --> 0:04:52,000
poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere

105
0:04:53.58,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has an equal voice for the very first time.

106
0:04:56.928,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity

107
0:05:00.463,000 --> 0:05:02,000
not to do this, given that we can?

108
0:05:03.111,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,

109
0:05:08.01,000 --> 0:05:11,000
tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,

110
0:05:11.956,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and, I'd argue, the security and future

111
0:05:14.303,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of you and your family is also at stake.

112
0:05:16.766,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps

113
0:05:20.355,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in this crowdsourcing campaign:

114
0:05:22.71,000 --> 0:05:24,000
collecting, connecting and committing.

115
0:05:25.587,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign

116
0:05:27.759,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in core polling data.

117
0:05:29.883,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Let's go into every country that will let us in,

118
0:05:31.997,000 --> 0:05:33,000
ask 1,001 people what they want

119
0:05:34.585,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the new goals to be, making special efforts

120
0:05:36.645,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to reach the poorest, those without access

121
0:05:38.884,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views

122
0:05:41.933,000 --> 0:05:43,000
are at the center of the goals going forward.

123
0:05:44.217,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey

124
0:05:48.312,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals

125
0:05:50.552,000 --> 0:05:52,000
going forward. The original goals didn't really have

126
0:05:52.578,000 --> 0:05:53,000
good baseline survey data,

127
0:05:54.452,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure

128
0:05:58.844,000 --> 0:06:,000
we can really monitor the progress.

129
0:06:00.916,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.

130
0:06:03.621,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition

131
0:06:06.738,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of social media giants and upstarts,

132
0:06:09.708,000 --> 0:06:12,000
telecoms companies, reality TV show formats,

133
0:06:13.657,000 --> 0:06:16,000
gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together

134
0:06:17.155,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in kind of their "We Are The World" moment.

135
0:06:20.596,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Could they come together and help

136
0:06:22.903,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded

137
0:06:25.684,000 --> 0:06:28,000
into the Millennial Generation's Goals?

138
0:06:28.708,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And if just five percent of the five billion plus

139
0:06:31.521,000 --> 0:06:34,000
who are currently connected made a comment,

140
0:06:34.768,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and that comment turned into a commitment,

141
0:06:37.09,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people

142
0:06:40.226,000 --> 0:06:43,000
around the world to help see these goals through.

143
0:06:43.644,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,

144
0:06:47.146,000 --> 0:06:48,000
based upon our experience of campaigning

145
0:06:48.875,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and getting world leaders to commit,

146
0:06:50.516,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I think world leaders will commit

147
0:06:51.957,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.

148
0:06:54.364,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But the question really is, through this process

149
0:06:56.987,000 --> 0:06:58,000
will we all have become committed?

150
0:06:59.675,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor

151
0:07:02.576,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and provide feedback, make sure these promises

152
0:07:04.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
are really delivering results?

153
0:07:06.823,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,

154
0:07:10.024,000 --> 0:07:12,000
mostly piloted within Africa, actually.

155
0:07:12.736,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes

156
0:07:14.975,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and crowdsources information about where projects are,

157
0:07:17.427,000 --> 0:07:18,000
are they delivering results.

158
0:07:19.014,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Often, they're not in the right place.

159
0:07:20.79,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili,

160
0:07:24.244,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which geocodes and crowdsources information

161
0:07:26.642,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in complex emergencies to help target responses.

162
0:07:30.555,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is some of the most exciting stuff

163
0:07:33.964,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in development and democracy,

164
0:07:35.823,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where citizens on the edge of a network

165
0:07:37.922,000 --> 0:07:38,000
are helping to force open the process

166
0:07:39.863,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to make sure that the big global aid promises

167
0:07:42.574,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people

168
0:07:46.028,000 --> 0:07:5,000
at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.

169
0:07:50.184,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This openness, this forcing openness, is key,

170
0:07:53.696,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and if it wasn't entirely transparent already,

171
0:07:56.632,000 --> 0:08:,000
I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.

172
0:08:01.276,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Long-term trends suggest that this century

173
0:08:03.683,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is going to be a tough place to live,

174
0:08:05.939,000 --> 0:08:08,000
with population increases, consumption patterns increasing,

175
0:08:09.836,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and conflict over scarce natural resources.

176
0:08:13.27,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And look at the state of global politics today.

177
0:08:16.914,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,

178
0:08:20.015,000 --> 0:08:22,000
or the Mexican G20, also last week.

179
0:08:22.369,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Both, if we're honest, a bust.

180
0:08:25.28,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Our world leaders, our global politics,

181
0:08:27.443,000 --> 0:08:29,000
currently can't get it done.

182
0:08:30.132,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They need our help. They need the cavalry,

183
0:08:33.505,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.

184
0:08:35.738,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's got to come from us, and I see this process

185
0:08:38.973,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion

186
0:08:41.924,000 --> 0:08:43,000
what the world wants to work on together

187
0:08:44.318,000 --> 0:08:47,000
as one vital means by which we can crowdsource

188
0:08:47.685,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the force to really build that constituency

189
0:08:51.013,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that's going to reinvigorate global governance

190
0:08:53.444,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in the 21st century.

191
0:08:55.435,000 --> 0:09:,000
I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.

192
0:09:00.564,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago

193
0:09:04.063,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we had called Make Poverty History.

194
0:09:06.206,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It was a naive thought in many people's minds,

195
0:09:09.496,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan

196
0:09:12.265,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that worked for the moment. But look.

197
0:09:15.495,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25

198
0:09:19.64,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.

199
0:09:22.784,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's getting near zero.

200
0:09:25.111,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now sure, progress in China and India

201
0:09:27.351,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and poverty reduction there was key to that,

202
0:09:29.573,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.

203
0:09:32.706,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It will get harder as we get towards zero,

204
0:09:35.54,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as the poor will be increasingly located

205
0:09:37.678,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in post-conflict, fragile states,

206
0:09:39.968,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or maybe in middle income states

207
0:09:41.944,000 --> 0:09:43,000
where they don't really care about the marginalized.

208
0:09:44.598,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning

209
0:09:48.545,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and creative and technological innovation combined

210
0:09:51.707,000 --> 0:09:53,000
working together more and more as one,

211
0:09:54.126,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I think we can get this and other goals done.

212
0:09:57.749,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Thank you. (Applause)

213
0:10:00.435,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Applause)

214
0:10:05.76,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.

215
0:10:07.92,000 --> 0:10:1,000
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids

216
0:10:11.696,000 --> 0:10:14,000
died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids

217
0:10:15.221,000 --> 0:10:17,000
were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,

218
0:10:18.112,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?

219
0:10:21.366,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there,

220
0:10:23.986,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that 5,000 -- is that the number?

221
0:10:27.068,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.

222
0:10:29.06,000 --> 0:10:3,000
CA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.

223
0:10:30.731,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything

224
0:10:34.044,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.

225
0:10:37.396,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This must drive you crazy.

226
0:10:39.23,000 --> 0:10:41,000
JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country

227
0:10:42.069,000 --> 0:10:44,000
about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not

228
0:10:44.584,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.

229
0:10:46.902,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,

230
0:10:51.456,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.

231
0:10:53.925,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march

232
0:10:57.556,000 --> 0:11:,000
outside this very building knew these results.

233
0:11:00.81,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way

234
0:11:03.689,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to better communicate it, because we have not.

235
0:11:05.941,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.

236
0:11:09.223,000 --> 0:11:12,000
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice

237
0:11:12.431,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact

238
0:11:14.94,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we'd get better policy.

239
0:11:16.941,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.

240
0:11:19.462,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment,

241
0:11:22.003,000 --> 0:11:24,000
need not have been a bust, okay?

242
0:11:24.345,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But these conferences are going on,

243
0:11:26.215,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I know people get skeptical and cynical

244
0:11:27.912,000 --> 0:11:28,000
about the big global summits and the promises

245
0:11:29.688,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and their never being kept, but actually,

246
0:11:31.435,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the bits that are, are making a difference,

247
0:11:33.818,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and what the politicians need

248
0:11:35.267,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is more permission from the public.

249
0:11:37.508,000 --> 0:11:39,000
CA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.

250
0:11:39.597,000 --> 0:11:4,000
by which this might happen.

251
0:11:41.557,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I mean, if the people here who've had experience

252
0:11:43.444,000 --> 0:11:46,000
using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them

253
0:11:46.604,000 --> 0:11:47,000
this week and try to take this forward.

254
0:11:48.23,000 --> 0:11:49,000
JD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,

255
0:11:50.2,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if this conference led in some way

256
0:11:52.812,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,

257
0:11:55.821,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,

258
0:11:58.178,000 --> 0:11:59,000
so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.

259
0:11:59.619,000 --> 0:12:,000
CA: Thank you, thank you.

260
0:12:01.567,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

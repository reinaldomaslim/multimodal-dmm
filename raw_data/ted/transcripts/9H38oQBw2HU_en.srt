1
0:00:12.639,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So this is a picture of my dad and me, at the beach in Far Rockaway,

2
0:00:19.178,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or actually Rockaway Park.

3
0:00:20.664,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm the one with the blond hair.

4
0:00:23.354,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My dad's the guy with the cigarette.

5
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was the 60's.

6
0:00:26.495,000 --> 0:00:27,000
A lot of people smoked back then.

7
0:00:28.157,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In the summer of 2009, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

8
0:00:34.302,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody.

9
0:00:38.049,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If you're a man in the US,

10
0:00:40.701,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you've got about a one in two chance

11
0:00:42.771,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime.

12
0:00:45.73,000 --> 0:00:47,000
If you're a woman, you've got about a one in three chance

13
0:00:48.539,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of being diagnosed with cancer.

14
0:00:51.025,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Everybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer.

15
0:00:55.355,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, my dad's doing better today,

16
0:00:56.959,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial

17
0:01:02.016,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated

18
0:01:05.273,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and very good for his particular kind of cancer.

19
0:01:07.55,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There are over 200 kinds of cancer.

20
0:01:10.66,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And what I want to talk about today

21
0:01:12.944,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is how we can help more people like my dad,

22
0:01:15.84,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because we have to change the way we think about raising money

23
0:01:18.818,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to fund cancer research.

24
0:01:21.273,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So a while after my dad was diagnosed,

25
0:01:23.231,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo.

26
0:01:26.407,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT,

27
0:01:29.697,000 --> 0:01:3,000
where I also have a position,

28
0:01:31.659,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we were talking about cancer.

29
0:01:33.285,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And Andrew had been doing his own bits of research,

30
0:01:35.703,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and one of the things that he had been told

31
0:01:37.821,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that he'd learned from studying the literature

32
0:01:42.29,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was that there's actually a big bottleneck.

33
0:01:44.395,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's very difficult to develop new drugs,

34
0:01:46.559,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs

35
0:01:48.943,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is because in the early stages of drug development,

36
0:01:51.388,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the drugs are very risky, and they're very expensive.

37
0:01:53.917,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,

38
0:01:56.814,000 --> 0:01:58,000
work on some of the math and the analytics

39
0:01:58.948,000 --> 0:02:,000
and see if we could figure out something we could do.

40
0:02:02.116,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now I'm not a scientist.

41
0:02:03.609,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You know, I don't know how to build a drug.

42
0:02:05.681,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --

43
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
none of those guys are scientists either.

44
0:02:13.339,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug.

45
0:02:16.828,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But we know a little bit about risk mitigation

46
0:02:19.051,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and a little bit about financial engineering,

47
0:02:21.191,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and so we started thinking, what could we do?

48
0:02:24.079,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm going to tell you about some work

49
0:02:25.913,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we've been doing over the last couple years

50
0:02:28.022,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that we think could fundamentally change the way

51
0:02:30.317,000 --> 0:02:32,000
research for cancer and lots of other things gets done.

52
0:02:33.75,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We want to let the research drive the funding,

53
0:02:36.163,000 --> 0:02:37,000
not the other way around.

54
0:02:38.446,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So in order to get started,

55
0:02:39.764,000 --> 0:02:41,000
let me tell you how you get a drug financed.

56
0:02:41.911,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Imagine that you're in your lab -- you're a scientist, you're not like me --

57
0:02:46.336,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and you've developed a new compound

58
0:02:48.332,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer.

59
0:02:52.212,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Well, what you do is, you test in animals, you test in test tubes,

60
0:02:55.892,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside,

61
0:02:58.976,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and in order to get from the bench, the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,

62
0:03:02.652,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you've got to get the drug tested.

63
0:03:04.506,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And the way the drug gets tested

64
0:03:06.134,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is through a series of, basically, experiments,

65
0:03:08.379,000 --> 0:03:1,000
through these large, they're called trials,

66
0:03:10.434,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that they do to determine whether the drug is safe

67
0:03:12.813,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and whether it works and all these things.

68
0:03:14.85,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So the FDA has a very specific protocol.

69
0:03:16.954,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In the first phase of this testing,

70
0:03:18.669,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which is called testing for toxicity, it's called Phase I.

71
0:03:22.675,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In the first phase, you give the drug to healthy people

72
0:03:25.393,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you see if it actually makes them sick.

73
0:03:28.578,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In other words, are the side effects just so severe

74
0:03:30.996,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that no matter how much good it does,

75
0:03:32.808,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it's not going to be worth it?

76
0:03:34.29,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Does it cause heart attacks, kill people, liver failure?

77
0:03:37.005,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And it turns out, that's a pretty high hurdle.

78
0:03:39.182,000 --> 0:03:41,000
About a third of all drugs drop out at that point.

79
0:03:41.663,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective,

80
0:03:44.546,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and you give it to people with cancer

81
0:03:46.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and you see if it makes them better.

82
0:03:48.115,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out.

83
0:03:50.457,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And in the third phase, you test it on a very large sample,

84
0:03:53.287,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and you're trying to determine what the right dose is,

85
0:03:56.419,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is it better than what's available today? If not, then why build it?

86
0:03:59.891,000 --> 0:04:,000
When you're done with all that,

87
0:04:01.96,000 --> 0:04:03,000
what you have is a very small percentage of drugs

88
0:04:04.469,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that start the process actually come out the other side.

89
0:04:07.319,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So those blue bottles -- those blue bottles save lives,

90
0:04:11.057,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they're also worth billions, sometimes billions a year.

91
0:04:14.8,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So now here's a question:

92
0:04:16.399,000 --> 0:04:19,000
if I were to ask you, for example,

93
0:04:19.665,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to make a one-time investment of, say, 200 million dollars

94
0:04:23.654,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to buy one of those bottles,

95
0:04:25.322,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so 200 million dollars up front, one time, to buy one of those bottles,

96
0:04:28.698,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I won't tell you which one it is,

97
0:04:30.338,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones.

98
0:04:34.263,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Does that sound like a good deal for anybody?

99
0:04:36.418,000 --> 0:04:37,000
No. No, right?

100
0:04:37.68,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And of course, it's a very, very risky trial position,

101
0:04:40.238,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's why it's very hard to get funding,

102
0:04:42.404,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but to a first approximation, that's actually the proposal.

103
0:04:45.224,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You have to fund these things from the early stages on.

104
0:04:47.858,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It takes a long time.

105
0:04:49.149,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So Andrew said to me, he said,

106
0:04:52.59,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"What if we stop thinking about these as drugs?

107
0:04:55.06,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What if we start thinking about them as financial assets?"

108
0:04:57.87,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They've got really weird payoff structures and all that,

109
0:05:00.538,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them.

110
0:05:03.902,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade

111
0:05:06.386,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets.

112
0:05:10.344,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let's create a giant fund.

113
0:05:12.289,000 --> 0:05:14,000
In finance, we know what to do with assets that are risky.

114
0:05:15.057,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns.

115
0:05:18.193,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So we did some math, and it turned out you could make this work,

116
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but in order to make it work, you need about 80 to 150 drugs.

117
0:05:24.716,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now the good news is, there's plenty of drugs

118
0:05:26.905,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that are waiting to be tested.

119
0:05:28.389,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We've been told that there's a backlog of about 20 years of drugs

120
0:05:32.346,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that are waiting to be tested but can't be funded.

121
0:05:34.823,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In fact, that early stage of the funding process,

122
0:05:37.244,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that Phase I and preclinical stuff,

123
0:05:39.24,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that's actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Death

124
0:05:42.133,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because it's where drugs go to die.

125
0:05:43.894,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's very hard to for them to get through there,

126
0:05:46.172,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and of course, if you can't get through there,

127
0:05:48.423,000 --> 0:05:49,000
you can't get to the later stages.

128
0:05:50.081,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So we did this math, and we figured out, OK,

129
0:05:52.157,000 --> 0:05:55,000
well, you need about 80 to, say, 150, or something like that, drugs.

130
0:05:55.767,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And then we did a little more math, and we said, OK,

131
0:05:58.577,000 --> 0:06:01,000
well, that's a fund of about three to 15 billion dollars.

132
0:06:01.863,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one.

133
0:06:05.905,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We got rid of the risk, but now we need a lot of capital,

134
0:06:08.612,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets.

135
0:06:11.747,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Venture capitalists and philanthropies don't have it.

136
0:06:14.264,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets,

137
0:06:17.495,000 --> 0:06:2,000
who traditionally don't invest in this, to want to invest in this stuff.

138
0:06:21.011,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So again, financial engineering was helpful here.

139
0:06:23.353,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Imagine the megafund starts empty,

140
0:06:25.177,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity,

141
0:06:29.21,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and that generates cash flow.

142
0:06:30.964,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That cash flow is used, then, to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need,

143
0:06:34.733,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and those drugs start working their way through that approval process,

144
0:06:38.07,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and each time they go through a phase of approval,

145
0:06:40.485,000 --> 0:06:41,000
they gain value.

146
0:06:41.704,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Most of them don't make it, but a few of them do,

147
0:06:44.086,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and with the ones that gain value, you can sell some,

148
0:06:46.616,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and when you sell them,

149
0:06:47.878,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you have money to pay the interest on those bonds,

150
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but also to fund the next round of trials.

151
0:06:52.315,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's almost self-funding.

152
0:06:53.564,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You do that for the course of the transaction,

153
0:06:55.868,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio,

154
0:06:58.321,000 --> 0:07:01,000
pay back the bonds, and you can give the equity holders a nice return.

155
0:07:01.667,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That was the theory, and we talked about it,

156
0:07:03.866,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we did a bunch of experiments,

157
0:07:05.36,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and then we said, let's really try to test it.

158
0:07:07.552,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We spent the next two years doing research.

159
0:07:10.915,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital.

160
0:07:15.721,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We talked to people who have developed drugs.

161
0:07:17.997,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We talked to pharmaceutical companies.

162
0:07:19.856,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We actually looked at the data for drugs,

163
0:07:22.71,000 --> 0:07:26,000
over 2,000 drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn,

164
0:07:26.906,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and we also ran millions of simulations.

165
0:07:30.23,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And all that actually took a lot of time.

166
0:07:32.784,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But when we were done, we found something that was sort of surprising.

167
0:07:36.101,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It was feasible to structure that fund

168
0:07:37.951,000 --> 0:07:39,000
such that when you were done structuring it,

169
0:07:40.067,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you could actually produce low-risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders,

170
0:07:44.03,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that would give you yields of about five to eight percent,

171
0:07:46.794,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and you could produce equity

172
0:07:48.283,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that would give equity holders about a 12 percent return.

173
0:07:51.002,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist.

174
0:07:54.408,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They want to make those big bets

175
0:07:55.965,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and get those billion dollar payoffs.

176
0:07:57.995,000 --> 0:08:,000
But it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested.

177
0:08:01.457,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401(k) plans

178
0:08:05.06,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and all this other stuff.

179
0:08:06.687,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So we published some articles in the academic press,

180
0:08:09.183,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in medical journals, in finance journals.

181
0:08:14.022,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this

182
0:08:17.491,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that we began to get some traction.

183
0:08:20.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We wanted to do more than just make people aware of it.

184
0:08:22.98,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We wanted people to get involved.

185
0:08:24.584,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So we took all of our computer code and made that available online

186
0:08:27.721,000 --> 0:08:29,000
under an open-source license to anybody that wanted it.

187
0:08:30.433,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And you guys can download it today

188
0:08:32.152,000 --> 0:08:35,000
if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work.

189
0:08:35.303,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And that was really effective,

190
0:08:36.812,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because people that didn't believe our assumptions

191
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:41,000
could try their own and see how it would work.

192
0:08:41.375,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,

193
0:08:43.385,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is there enough money in the world to fund this?

194
0:08:45.684,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I've told you there's enough drugs, but is there enough money?

195
0:08:48.625,000 --> 0:08:49,000
There's 100 trillion dollars of capital

196
0:08:50.555,000 --> 0:08:52,000
currently invested in fixed-income securities.

197
0:08:54.632,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's a hundred thousand billion.

198
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:08:59,000
There's plenty of money.

199
0:08:59.951,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:04.088,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But we realized it's more than just money that's required.

201
0:09:06.855,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We had to get people motivated, involved,

202
0:09:08.879,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and get them to understand this.

203
0:09:10.775,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong.

204
0:09:14.334,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What are all the challenges that might get in the way?

205
0:09:17.22,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we had a long list.

206
0:09:18.464,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves,

207
0:09:21.467,000 --> 0:09:22,000
different pieces of this problem.

208
0:09:23.91,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And we said, could you start a work stream on credit risk?

209
0:09:26.745,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects?

210
0:09:29.414,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Could you start a work stream on how you would manage so many projects?

211
0:09:33.471,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams,

212
0:09:37.167,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and then we held a conference.

213
0:09:39.039,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The conference was held over this past summer.

214
0:09:41.293,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It was an invitation-only conference.

215
0:09:43.097,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It was sponsored by the American Cancer Society

216
0:09:45.371,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute.

217
0:09:48.804,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We had experts from every field we thought would be important,

218
0:09:51.786,000 --> 0:09:53,000
including the government, and people that run research centers,

219
0:09:54.807,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and for two days they heard the reports

220
0:09:57.268,000 --> 0:09:59,000
from those five work streams, and talked about it.

221
0:09:59.884,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It was the first time the people who could make this happen

222
0:10:02.746,000 --> 0:10:05,000
sat across the table from each other and had these conversations.

223
0:10:05.837,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner,

224
0:10:09.358,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and at that dinner, you get to know each other,

225
0:10:12.154,000 --> 0:10:13,000
sort of like what we're doing here.

226
0:10:13.919,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I happened to look out the window,

227
0:10:15.589,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and hand on my heart,

228
0:10:16.909,000 --> 0:10:18,000
on the night of this conference -- it was the summertime --

229
0:10:19.745,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.

230
0:10:22.013,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So I'd like to think it was a good sign.

231
0:10:24.082,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Since the conference, we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco,

232
0:10:28.307,000 --> 0:10:29,000
lots of different folks working on this

233
0:10:30.2,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to try to see if we can really make it happen.

234
0:10:32.932,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We're not looking to start a fund, but we want somebody else to do this.

235
0:10:36.359,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because, again, I'm not a scientist.

236
0:10:38.553,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I can't build a drug.

237
0:10:40.456,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials.

238
0:10:44.443,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,

239
0:10:47.292,000 --> 0:10:49,000
with our 529 plans, with our pension plans,

240
0:10:49.884,000 --> 0:10:51,000
all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials

241
0:10:52.791,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and get paid well for doing it

242
0:10:54.399,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and save millions of lives like my dad.

243
0:10:57.17,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Thank you.

244
0:10:58.345,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

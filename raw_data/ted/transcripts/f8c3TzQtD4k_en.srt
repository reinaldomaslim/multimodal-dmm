0:00:12.529,000 --> 0:00:13,000
[As of the morning February 27, 2020,

2
0:00:14.333,000 --> 0:00:17,000
there were at least 82,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the coronavirus

3
0:00:17.834,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and 2,810 deaths from it.

4
0:00:19.159,000 --> 0:00:22,000
TED invited Dr. David Heymann to share the latest findings about the outbreak.]

5
0:00:22.97,000 --> 0:00:24,000
[What happens if you get infected with the coronavirus?]

6
0:00:25.635,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This looks like a very mild disease, like a common cold,

7
0:00:28.459,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the majority of people.

8
0:00:30.252,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There are certain people who get infected and have very serious illness;

9
0:00:34.776,000 --> 0:00:35,000
among them are health workers.

10
0:00:36.251,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's a very serious infection in them,

11
0:00:38.085,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as they get a higher dose than normal people,

12
0:00:40.434,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and at the same time, they have no immunity.

13
0:00:42.855,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So in the general population,

14
0:00:46.934,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's likely that the dose of virus that you receive when you are infected

15
0:00:51.157,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is much less than the dose that a health worker would receive,

16
0:00:54.395,000 --> 0:00:56,000
health workers having more serious infections.

17
0:00:56.704,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So your infection would be less serious, hopefully.

18
0:00:59.728,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So that leaves the elderly and those with comorbidities

19
0:01:03.081,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to really be the ones that we have to make sure

20
0:01:05.657,000 --> 0:01:07,000
are taken care of in hospitals.

21
0:01:07.846,000 --> 0:01:11,000
[Who are the people who should be most concerned about this?]

22
0:01:12.395,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, the most concerned are people

23
0:01:14.645,000 --> 0:01:17,000
who are, first of all, in developing countries

24
0:01:17.784,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and who don't have access to good medical care

25
0:01:20.593,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and may not have access at all to a hospital,

26
0:01:23.316,000 --> 0:01:26,000
should an epidemic occur in their country.

27
0:01:26.474,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Those people would be at great risk,

28
0:01:28.252,000 --> 0:01:29,000
especially the elderly.

29
0:01:29.688,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Elderly in all populations are at risk,

30
0:01:32.339,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but especially those who can't get to oxygen.

31
0:01:35.038,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In industrialized countries,

32
0:01:36.694,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's the very elderly who have comorbidities,

33
0:01:39.428,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who have diabetes, who have other diseases,

34
0:01:41.706,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who are at risk.

35
0:01:42.942,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The general population doesn't appear to be at great risk.

36
0:01:45.983,000 --> 0:01:49,000
[What pre-existing medical conditions put people at higher risk?]

37
0:01:50.15,000 --> 0:01:51,000
First of all,

38
0:01:51.333,000 --> 0:01:54,000
pulmonary disease existing as a comorbidity is also important.

39
0:01:55.157,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In general, the elderly are at greater risk,

40
0:01:57.685,000 --> 0:01:59,000
especially those over 70,

41
0:01:59.792,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because their immune systems are not as effective

42
0:02:02.884,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as they might have once been,

43
0:02:04.471,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they are more susceptible to infections.

44
0:02:07.313,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In addition, in some instances in China,

45
0:02:10.797,000 --> 0:02:13,000
there's been a coinfection with influenza

46
0:02:14.099,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and at the same time,

47
0:02:15.282,000 --> 0:02:17,000
there have been some bacterial superinfections

48
0:02:17.599,000 --> 0:02:18,000
on the pneumonias that are occurring.

49
0:02:19.532,000 --> 0:02:22,000
[Where can we find up-to-date information?]

50
0:02:22.559,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta keeps track

51
0:02:25.499,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and has updates on a regular basis on its website.

52
0:02:29.237,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Also, the World Health Organization in Geneva,

53
0:02:31.872,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is coordinating many of the activities

54
0:02:34.014,000 --> 0:02:35,000
going on internationally,

55
0:02:35.506,000 --> 0:02:37,000
also has a website with daily updates.

56
0:02:37.886,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's our responsibility to get that information as individuals,

57
0:02:41.49,000 --> 0:02:42,000
so we understand

58
0:02:42.895,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and can make sure that we can contribute in our own way

59
0:02:45.665,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to prevention of major spread.

60
0:02:48.011,000 --> 0:02:5,000
[You led the global response to the SARS outbreak in 2003.

61
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How does this outbreak compare?]

62
0:02:52.408,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's the same problem with all new infections.

63
0:02:54.678,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is an infection that's coming to humans

64
0:02:57.234,000 --> 0:03:,000
who have never been exposed to this virus before.

65
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They don't have any antibody protection,

66
0:03:02.752,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and it's not clear whether their immune system

67
0:03:05.306,000 --> 0:03:06,000
can handle this virus or not.

68
0:03:07.292,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a virus that usually finds itself in bats or in other animals,

69
0:03:11.983,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and all of a sudden, it's in humans.

70
0:03:13.824,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And humans just don't have experience with this virus.

71
0:03:17.006,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But gradually,

72
0:03:18.188,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we are beginning to learn a lot, as we did with SARS.

73
0:03:21.021,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And you know, there are certainly a larger number of deaths

74
0:03:24.911,000 --> 0:03:25,000
than there were with SARS.

75
0:03:26.752,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But when you divide that by a denominator of persons who are infected,

76
0:03:30.974,000 --> 0:03:33,000
there are many, many more persons infected than there were with SARS.

77
0:03:34.577,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The case fatality ratio,

78
0:03:36.136,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that is the ratio of deaths to the numbers of cases in SARS,

79
0:03:40.672,000 --> 0:03:41,000
was about 10 percent.

80
0:03:42.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
With the current coronavirus, COVID-19,

81
0:03:45.379,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it is two percent or probably less.

82
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So it's a much less virulent virus,

83
0:03:51.188,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but it's still a virus that causes mortality,

84
0:03:53.649,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that's what we don't want entering human populations.

85
0:03:56.618,000 --> 0:03:59,000
[Have we responded adequately at border crossings, such as airports?]

86
0:04:00.407,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's clearly understood that airports or any land borders

87
0:04:04.724,000 --> 0:04:06,000
cannot prevent a disease from entering.

88
0:04:06.978,000 --> 0:04:08,000
People in the incubation period can cross that border,

89
0:04:09.792,000 --> 0:04:1,000
can enter countries

90
0:04:11.141,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and can then infect others when they become sick.

91
0:04:14.339,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So borders are not a means of preventing infections from entering a country

92
0:04:20.347,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by checking temperatures.

93
0:04:22.355,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Borders are important because you can provide to people arriving

94
0:04:26.069,000 --> 0:04:29,000
from areas that might be at risk of having had infection,

95
0:04:29.721,000 --> 0:04:31,000
provide them with an understanding,

96
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:34,000
either a printed understanding or a verbal understanding,

97
0:04:34.958,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of what the signs and symptoms are of this infection,

98
0:04:37.847,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and what they should do if they feel that they might be infected.

99
0:04:41.587,000 --> 0:04:44,000
[What's the timeline for a vaccine?]

100
0:04:44.749,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Vaccines are under development right now,

101
0:04:46.837,000 --> 0:04:48,000
there's a lot of research going on.

102
0:04:48.995,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That research requires first that the vaccine be developed,

103
0:04:52.932,000 --> 0:04:56,000
then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals,

104
0:04:57.354,000 --> 0:05:,000
who are challenged with the virus after they are vaccinated,

105
0:05:00.885,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and then it must go into human studies.

106
0:05:03.258,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The animal studies have not yet begun,

107
0:05:05.395,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but will soon begin for certain vaccines.

108
0:05:07.966,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And it's thought that by the end of the year,

109
0:05:10.133,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or early next year,

110
0:05:11.315,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there may be some candidate vaccines

111
0:05:13.762,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that can then be studied for licensing by regulatory agencies.

112
0:05:18.609,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So we're talking about at least a year until there's vaccine available

113
0:05:22.752,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that can be used in many populations.

114
0:05:25.338,000 --> 0:05:28,000
[What questions about the outbreak are still unanswered?]

115
0:05:29.347,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's clear we know how it transmits,

116
0:05:31.188,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we don't know how easily it transmits in humans,

117
0:05:33.851,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in communities or in unenclosed areas.

118
0:05:38.244,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We know, for example,

119
0:05:39.982,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that in the enclosed area of a cruise ship, it spread very easily.

120
0:05:43.871,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We need to better understand

121
0:05:45.522,000 --> 0:05:48,000
how it will spread once it gets into more open areas

122
0:05:49.013,000 --> 0:05:52,000
where people are exposed to people who might be sick.

123
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
[What about the global response could be improved?]

124
0:05:56.51,000 --> 0:05:59,000
A major problem in the world today is that we look at outbreaks

125
0:06:00.261,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in developing countries

126
0:06:01.839,000 --> 0:06:03,000
as something that we need to go and stop.

127
0:06:04.728,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So when there's an outbreak of Ebola,

128
0:06:06.53,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we think "How can we go and stop this outbreak in the country?"

129
0:06:09.554,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We don't think about "How can we help that country

130
0:06:13.141,000 --> 0:06:14,000
strengthen its capacity,

131
0:06:15.068,000 --> 0:06:18,000
so that it can detect and respond to infections?"

132
0:06:18.653,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So we haven't invested enough

133
0:06:21.122,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in helping countries develop their core capacity in public health.

134
0:06:25.411,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What we've done is invested in many mechanisms globally,

135
0:06:29.315,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which can provide support to other countries

136
0:06:32.276,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to go and help stop outbreaks.

137
0:06:34.331,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But we want to see a world where every country

138
0:06:36.593,000 --> 0:06:38,000
can do its best to stop its own outbreaks.

139
0:06:38.834,000 --> 0:06:41,000
[Will we see more emerging disease outbreaks in the future?]

140
0:06:41.95,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Today, there are over seven billion people.

141
0:06:43.982,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And when those people come into the world,

142
0:06:46.046,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they demand more food,

143
0:06:47.316,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they demand a whole series of things

144
0:06:49.125,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and they live closer together.

145
0:06:50.586,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In fact, we're an urban world, where people live in urban areas.

146
0:06:54.196,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And at the same time, we're growing more animals,

147
0:06:57.129,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and those animals are contributing food to humans as well.

148
0:07:01.677,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So what we see

149
0:07:02.852,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is that that animal-human interface is becoming closer and closer together.

150
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And this intensive agriculture of animals

151
0:07:11.703,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and this intensive increase in human populations

152
0:07:14.521,000 --> 0:07:16,000
living together on the same planet

153
0:07:16.561,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur.

154
0:07:21.792,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks.

155
0:07:24.827,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So an emerging infection today is just a warning

156
0:07:28.765,000 --> 0:07:29,000
of what will happen in the future.

157
0:07:30.573,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We have to make sure

158
0:07:31.802,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that that technical collaboration in the world

159
0:07:34.879,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is there to work together

160
0:07:36.927,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to make sure that we can understand these outbreaks when they occur

161
0:07:40.3,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them.

162
0:07:44.182,000 --> 0:07:46,000
[Is the worst behind us?]

163
0:07:46.455,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I can't predict with accuracy.

164
0:07:48.043,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So all I can say is that we must all be prepared

165
0:07:51.09,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for the worst-case scenario.

166
0:07:52.974,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And at the same time,

167
0:07:54.641,000 --> 0:07:57,000
learn how we can protect ourselves and protect others

168
0:07:57.712,000 --> 0:07:59,000
should we become a part of that epidemic.

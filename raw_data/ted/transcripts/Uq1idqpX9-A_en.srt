1
0:00:13.055,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man

2
0:00:16.708,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in a cowboy hat and chaps,

3
0:00:18.389,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is in the ring

4
0:00:19.567,000 --> 0:00:21,000
as the arena full of fans cheer him on.

5
0:00:21.998,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Their hero:

6
0:00:23.471,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Cowboy" Gator Magraw.

7
0:00:25.66,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Gator bounces off the ropes and is quickly body-slammed to the mat.

8
0:00:29.229,000 --> 0:00:31,000
His wild opponent leaps into the air,

9
0:00:31.494,000 --> 0:00:33,000
crashing down onto Gator's rib cage.

10
0:00:34.021,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Gator struggles to breathe, wondering:

11
0:00:37.047,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"Is this really what my father wanted for me?"

12
0:00:39.873,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:41.982,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That wild man in the chaps ...

14
0:00:44.74,000 --> 0:00:45,000
was me.

15
0:00:45.924,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:47.008,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Applause)

17
0:00:48.673,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Cheers)

18
0:00:57.085,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the answer to the question, surprisingly,

19
0:01:00.185,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is yes.

20
0:01:01.368,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:03.224,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I grew up watching professional wrestling

22
0:01:05.527,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with my dad.

23
0:01:07.252,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And like him, I loved everything about it:

24
0:01:09.409,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the showmanship, the athletic skill,

25
0:01:11.477,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the drama.

26
0:01:13.062,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'd be this little boy, bouncing all over our living room,

27
0:01:16.538,000 --> 0:01:18,000
pretending to be my favorite wrestlers from TV.

28
0:01:19.53,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My dad actually reminded me a little bit of Hulk Hogan,

29
0:01:22.185,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but I was Hulk Hogan and he was Andre the Giant.

30
0:01:24.764,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'd get all serious on him and say things like, "Dad ...

31
0:01:27.751,000 --> 0:01:3,000
someday I am going to be world heavyweight champion."

32
0:01:32.443,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And he would usually smile and very calmly say,

33
0:01:36.183,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"OK, then I guess I can count on you to be my retirement fund."

34
0:01:40.647,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:42.019,000 --> 0:01:43,000
When I was 16,

36
0:01:43.198,000 --> 0:01:45,000
a small wrestling show came to my little town in Minnesota.

37
0:01:46.071,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I couldn't believe it.

38
0:01:47.265,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Nothing like that had ever come to my town before.

39
0:01:49.905,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So I got to the arena early in the morning the day of the show,

40
0:01:52.986,000 --> 0:01:55,000
waiting out in the parking lot to see if I could spot some wrestlers

41
0:01:56.249,000 --> 0:01:57,000
pulling up in their cars.

42
0:01:58.121,000 --> 0:02:,000
It wasn't as creepy as it sounds.

43
0:02:01.229,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But I could definitely tell who the wrestlers were,

44
0:02:03.664,000 --> 0:02:04,000
just the way they walked.

45
0:02:04.918,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They were tall and confident and intimidating,

46
0:02:07.126,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with their tank tops and Zubaz and fanny packs.

47
0:02:10.733,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Why wouldn't I want to be them?

48
0:02:12.595,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:13.852,000 --> 0:02:15,000
All I could think about was who are these people,

50
0:02:16.467,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and what are they like?

51
0:02:17.941,000 --> 0:02:18,000
How did they become wrestlers?

52
0:02:20.429,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So before the show started,

53
0:02:21.739,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I walked into this tiny arena --

54
0:02:24.03,000 --> 0:02:25,000
more like a gymnasium --

55
0:02:25.843,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I asked them if I could help set up the wrestling ring.

56
0:02:28.656,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"Sure, kid. No problem."

57
0:02:31.203,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And then I pleaded with them to show me some wrestling moves.

58
0:02:34.264,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Sure, kid. No problem."

59
0:02:37.074,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Man, they would just punch and kick me -- hard!

60
0:02:39.65,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I never complained.

61
0:02:41.491,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They would come to my town for one night every couple of months that year,

62
0:02:45.051,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and then -- poof! -- next day, they were gone.

63
0:02:47.248,000 --> 0:02:48,000
By the next year,

64
0:02:48.43,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they finally told me about an actual wrestling training camp

65
0:02:51.319,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that one of the wrestlers was running,

66
0:02:53.17,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I begged my parents to sign me up.

67
0:02:55.545,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Next thing I knew, I was a high school senior by day

68
0:02:58.437,000 --> 0:03:,000
and wrestling in front of live audiences by night.

69
0:03:01.383,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I had this giant poster of an alligator hanging on my bedroom wall.

70
0:03:04.999,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So when I needed to come up with a wrestling name at the last minute

71
0:03:08.258,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and Jesse "The Body" Ventura was already taken --

72
0:03:10.582,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:11.624,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I went with "Gator."

74
0:03:12.928,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I also wrestled in a t-shirt and camouflage pants

75
0:03:15.239,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because that's what I had in my closet.

76
0:03:18.444,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I hadn't quite figured out how to develop my own persona yet,

77
0:03:21.364,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but I was learning.

78
0:03:22.539,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was sort of like an apprenticeship.

79
0:03:24.397,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But I was a wrestler.

80
0:03:25.588,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And my dad would come to all my matches

81
0:03:27.584,000 --> 0:03:29,000
wearing a t-shirt that said, "Papa Gator" across the front.

82
0:03:30.487,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:31.662,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And he'd brag to his friends

84
0:03:33.024,000 --> 0:03:35,000
about how his son was going to pay for his retirement someday.

85
0:03:36.012,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:37.059,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I would've.

87
0:03:39.768,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Not long after I started wrestling,

88
0:03:41.469,000 --> 0:03:43,000
my dad unexpectedly passed away.

89
0:03:46.254,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And as you can imagine,

90
0:03:48.403,000 --> 0:03:5,000
especially as a teenage boy,

91
0:03:50.483,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it destroyed me.

92
0:03:54.913,000 --> 0:03:55,000
If you've ever lost someone,

93
0:03:56.359,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you know what a difficult time that can be.

94
0:03:58.648,000 --> 0:04:,000
Your mind -- it's not working right.

95
0:04:01.142,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The whole thing is just so surreal.

96
0:04:05.505,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I wanted to feel normal again, even if it was for just a second,

97
0:04:08.697,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so I went back to wrestling almost immediately.

98
0:04:11.813,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Wrestling belonged to me and my dad, you know?

99
0:04:15.278,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So there I was,

100
0:04:16.681,000 --> 0:04:17,000
sitting in the locker room,

101
0:04:18.05,000 --> 0:04:21,000
getting ready for a match within days of my dad passing away.

102
0:04:22.127,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He was gone.

103
0:04:24.433,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And sitting there alone --

104
0:04:27.532,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it felt like I was hiding.

105
0:04:29.68,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But it also felt like I needed to be there.

106
0:04:33.23,000 --> 0:04:35,000
One of the wrestlers who'd been on the scene a long time

107
0:04:35.944,000 --> 0:04:36,000
knew what I was going through,

108
0:04:37.427,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and he came over to see how I was holding up.

109
0:04:39.719,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I couldn't get the words out.

110
0:04:41.419,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I just said, "I don't know what I'm doing."

111
0:04:45.381,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then we just sat there in silence --

112
0:04:47.397,000 --> 0:04:48,000
just ... silence.

113
0:04:51.123,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Before he got up to get ready for his own match,

114
0:04:53.406,000 --> 0:04:54,000
he gave me this piece of advice

115
0:04:54.946,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that would change the entire direction of my life.

116
0:04:57.568,000 --> 0:05:01,000
He told me the best wrestlers are just themselves, but "turned up."

117
0:05:03.058,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He said successful wrestlers find the traits within themselves

118
0:05:06.462,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they're the strongest at

119
0:05:07.804,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and make those the focus of who they become in the ring.

120
0:05:11.902,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So there I sat --

121
0:05:13.385,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a scared teenager who didn't know who he was

122
0:05:15.48,000 --> 0:05:17,000
or why he was even wrestling anymore.

123
0:05:18.375,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I looked around the locker room at some of the other wrestlers,

124
0:05:21.396,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I thought,

125
0:05:22.594,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"I look so different. How can I ever be like them?"

126
0:05:25.826,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then it hit me.

127
0:05:27.422,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's the moment I realized I didn't have to be like them.

128
0:05:31.269,000 --> 0:05:33,000
What I did have to do was find out: What did it mean to be me?

129
0:05:34.699,000 --> 0:05:35,000
What made me unique,

130
0:05:36.345,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and how could I use it to my advantage?

131
0:05:39.005,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I knew I wasn't a chiseled athlete like some of these guys,

132
0:05:41.843,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I really didn't care.

133
0:05:43.157,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So the first thing I thought was,

134
0:05:44.766,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"How can I amplify something as simple as: comfortable with my own body?"

135
0:05:49.37,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I didn't know.

136
0:05:51.121,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then I thought:

137
0:05:53.353,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Speedo.

138
0:05:54.542,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:57.649,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

140
0:06:04.635,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or "trunks,"

141
0:06:05.809,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as we call them in wrestling.

142
0:06:07.904,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Yeah, trunks.

143
0:06:09.078,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I could be this big guy

144
0:06:10.262,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who was comfortable wearing these little trunks

145
0:06:12.537,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in front of a bunch of strangers.

146
0:06:14.153,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I ditched the t-shirt and camouflage pants,

147
0:06:16.34,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and Gator's new wardrobe was born.

148
0:06:18.11,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:19.487,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I was also pretty good at drawing cartoons,

150
0:06:21.586,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so I wondered if I could turn that up.

151
0:06:23.869,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I could design my own wrestling costumes,

152
0:06:26.291,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so each pair of trunks would have its own unique design and color,

153
0:06:29.563,000 --> 0:06:31,000
all of them completely different --

154
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and extremely comfortable, by the way.

155
0:06:33.886,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

156
0:06:35.672,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I was also the funny kid in school,

157
0:06:37.634,000 --> 0:06:38,000
believe it or not.

158
0:06:39.198,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So I thought maybe I could turn that up.

159
0:06:41.84,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Maybe I could go from the boy who made his buddies laugh

160
0:06:45.752,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to the man who could rally hundreds or thousands.

161
0:06:48.81,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So I committed to the idea

162
0:06:50.121,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that my character wasn't going to be as scary as some of the others.

163
0:06:53.416,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'd be hilarious from the moment I walked into the arena.

164
0:06:56.256,000 --> 0:06:58,000
With every wrestling match, I dug deeper.

165
0:06:59.14,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I found out that I could laugh at myself.

166
0:07:01.167,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So this guy would dance and sing his entrance music

167
0:07:03.605,000 --> 0:07:04,000
all the way to the ring.

168
0:07:05.142,000 --> 0:07:06,000
That was dancing, by the way.

169
0:07:06.796,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:08.137,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I found out that I was an OK wrestler,

171
0:07:09.988,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but I was an even better entertainer.

172
0:07:11.846,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And turning myself up made me unforgettable to the fans.

173
0:07:14.932,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I was trying to find those things about me --

174
0:07:17.135,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the simple things that were special,

175
0:07:18.989,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and then ask, "How can I turn them up?"

176
0:07:21.884,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now, I knew I wanted my character to be a man's man like my dad was.

177
0:07:25.586,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I thought, "What's more of a man's man than a cowboy?"

178
0:07:30.427,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And that's when Gator became "Cowboy" ... Gator ...

179
0:07:35.865,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Yeah, I needed a last name.

180
0:07:37.77,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I thought about it until my head hurt. I couldn't come up with anything.

181
0:07:41.21,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I'm sitting there watching TV one night, flipping through the channels,

182
0:07:44.604,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and this commercial comes on

183
0:07:45.976,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about a country singer who had just won an Entertainer of the Year award.

184
0:07:49.456,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Tim McGraw.

185
0:07:50.638,000 --> 0:07:52,000
He's a cool cowboy with a great last name.

186
0:07:52.669,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I liked his music.

187
0:07:53.868,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It was just all part of my process.

188
0:07:55.899,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But I just kept turning myself up

189
0:07:57.658,000 --> 0:08:,000
until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw!

190
0:08:02.304,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:04.224,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:10.351,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I knew that if I kept turning myself up

193
0:08:13.881,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and pushing myself harder,

194
0:08:15.414,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the opportunities would come.

195
0:08:17.971,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And then it finally happened.

196
0:08:20.093,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In the middle of the night,

197
0:08:21.495,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I got a phone call.

198
0:08:24.235,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It was the call I wish my dad was around to hear.

199
0:08:28.415,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The WWE,

200
0:08:30.099,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the biggest wrestling organization in the world,

201
0:08:32.863,000 --> 0:08:35,000
wanted me to come and be a part of Monday Night Raw.

202
0:08:36.435,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Yes -- all of my hard work and miles on the road were finally paying off.

203
0:08:42.14,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I got to walk down the WWE Raw entrance ramp on live television --

204
0:08:47.176,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:49.046,000 --> 0:08:51,000
dressed up as a fake security guard --

206
0:08:51.842,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

207
0:08:52.874,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to escort another wrestler to the ring.

208
0:08:54.851,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

209
0:08:57.264,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Sure, I was disappointed I didn't get to wrestle,

210
0:08:59.65,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but very few wrestlers get any kind of call from the WWE.

211
0:09:02.587,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Maybe one in a few hundred.

212
0:09:05.255,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw is what got me there.

213
0:09:08.949,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So instead of walking away that day,

214
0:09:11.733,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I decided to turn myself up again

215
0:09:13.698,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and become the best security guard I could.

216
0:09:16.232,000 --> 0:09:17,000
In fact, I did it so well,

217
0:09:17.756,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I was the only guard to get a close-up on TV that night.

218
0:09:21.725,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That's a big deal, you know?

219
0:09:23.402,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:26.503,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I got to sit backstage that entire day

221
0:09:28.921,000 --> 0:09:3,000
with some of the most famous pro wrestlers in the world,

222
0:09:31.643,000 --> 0:09:33,000
some of which were heroes of mine as a kid.

223
0:09:33.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I got to listen to them and learn from them,

224
0:09:36.587,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and for that day,

225
0:09:38.637,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I was accepted as one of them.

226
0:09:41.831,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Maybe my experience with the WWE wasn't ideal.

227
0:09:44.634,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I mean, I didn't get to wrestle.

228
0:09:46.838,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But it made me work harder,

229
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
turning myself up louder year after year.

230
0:09:52.055,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was becoming the biggest version of myself in the ring,

231
0:09:55.117,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and other people took notice.

232
0:09:57.411,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Before I knew it,

233
0:09:58.673,000 --> 0:10:,000
I'd gone from wrestling maybe once a month in Minnesota

234
0:10:01.627,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to as often as four times a week all over the United States

235
0:10:04.575,000 --> 0:10:06,000
on the independent wrestling circuit.

236
0:10:06.747,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I was literally living my dream.

237
0:10:11.131,000 --> 0:10:13,000
While wrestling over the next few years,

238
0:10:13.179,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I suffered a pretty bad shoulder injury

239
0:10:15.109,000 --> 0:10:17,000
right around the same time my wife and I found out

240
0:10:17.502,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that we were expecting our first child.

241
0:10:19.427,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I know what you're thinking,

242
0:10:20.794,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but believe me when I say those two events are completely unrelated.

243
0:10:24.092,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:30.168,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But I needed shoulder surgery,

245
0:10:33.296,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I wanted to be home with my family.

246
0:10:35.763,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It was my turn to be a dad.

247
0:10:38.383,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So on July 27, 2007,

248
0:10:41.562,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I wrestled my final match,

249
0:10:43.504,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and walked away from professional wrestling

250
0:10:45.55,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to pursue the next chapter of my life.

251
0:10:48.268,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And as time passed,

252
0:10:49.502,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the strangest thing started to happen.

253
0:10:51.814,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I found out that once someone has been turned up,

254
0:10:54.193,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it's pretty hard to turn them down.

255
0:10:57.035,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I left the ring but Gator stayed with me,

256
0:10:59.047,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I use the turned-up version of myself every day.

257
0:11:02.854,000 --> 0:11:05,000
My beautiful wife has been with me through this entire journey.

258
0:11:05.997,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And by the way -- she does not like pro wrestling.

259
0:11:09.243,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:10.488,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Like, at all.

261
0:11:12.567,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But she was always my biggest fan.

262
0:11:14.787,000 --> 0:11:15,000
She still is.

263
0:11:16.621,000 --> 0:11:19,000
She knows there's always going to be some part of Gator Magraw in here,

264
0:11:20.066,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and she wants our daughter and twin sons to discover themselves

265
0:11:23.114,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the way that I did,

266
0:11:24.297,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but probably with fewer body slams and steel chair shots to the head.

267
0:11:27.616,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I mean, do you know how many times she's had to remind me

268
0:11:30.331,000 --> 0:11:32,000
not to clothesline the referees at my kid's soccer games?

269
0:11:33.099,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:34.138,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I mean, it was just the one time,

271
0:11:35.766,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and my daughter was clearly fouled!

272
0:11:37.468,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

273
0:11:40.608,000 --> 0:11:43,000
As a parent now, I've begun to realize that my dad wanted something

274
0:11:43.879,000 --> 0:11:45,000
much more valuable than a retirement fund.

275
0:11:46.092,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Like most parents,

276
0:11:47.398,000 --> 0:11:49,000
he just wanted his kids to reach their fullest potential.

277
0:11:50.888,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I'm trying to teach my children

278
0:11:52.463,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that turning yourself up is just not some perfect idea of how to be great,

279
0:11:56.108,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it's a way of living --

280
0:11:57.829,000 --> 0:11:59,000
constantly looking for what makes you different

281
0:12:00.126,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and how you can amplify it for the world to see.

282
0:12:02.923,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And by the way, my kids don't like wrestling, either.

283
0:12:05.829,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

284
0:12:06.963,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But that's OK with me,

285
0:12:08.155,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because they each have their own unique talents that can be turned up

286
0:12:11.489,000 --> 0:12:12,000
just like the rest of us.

287
0:12:12.827,000 --> 0:12:14,000
My one son -- he's a whiz at electronics.

288
0:12:15.573,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So maybe helping him turn up makes him become the next Steve Jobs.

289
0:12:20.062,000 --> 0:12:22,000
My other son and my daughter -- they're great at art,

290
0:12:22.855,000 --> 0:12:24,000
so maybe helping them turn up their gifts

291
0:12:24.936,000 --> 0:12:26,000
helps them become the next Pablo Picasso.

292
0:12:28.208,000 --> 0:12:3,000
You never know what you have the ability to do

293
0:12:30.471,000 --> 0:12:31,000
until you dig.

294
0:12:32.669,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And don't be afraid to put yourself out there.

295
0:12:34.914,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I mean, look around.

296
0:12:36.092,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They say that if you get nervous in front of an audience,

297
0:12:38.811,000 --> 0:12:39,000
just imagine them in their underwear.

298
0:12:40.802,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But then I think, "Hey, I've wrestled in less."

299
0:12:43.066,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Laughter)

300
0:12:44.993,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

301
0:12:53.272,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Look, the wrestling circus doesn't need to come to your town

302
0:12:56.186,000 --> 0:12:58,000
before you get an invitation to be the real you --

303
0:12:58.562,000 --> 0:13:,000
the bigger, more stunning version of yourself.

304
0:13:01.25,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It doesn't even necessarily come from our parents.

305
0:13:03.995,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Turning yourself up means looking inward toward our true selves

306
0:13:07.253,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and harnessing the voice that says,

307
0:13:08.992,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"Maybe, just maybe,

308
0:13:11.015,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I am more than I thought I was."

309
0:13:13.509,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Thank you.

310
0:13:14.684,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Cartoons are basically short stories.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Not all of them have happy endings.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So how did I get started cartooning?

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I doodled a lot as a kid,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and if you spend enough time doodling,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
sooner or later, something happens:

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
all your career options run out.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So you have to make a living cartooning.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
when I was about eight or nine.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is some of my early work.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so it was [unclear].

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that really made me see the ocean differently,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and it's become the foundation of my work

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because, I feel like, if in a day,

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I can see the ocean differently,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
especially kids.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's just a big blue surface.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's a mystery.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There's been a lot of folklore

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
developed around the ocean,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
mostly negative.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And that prompted people to make maps like this,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but when you get to the waters edge,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as if to say, "All geography and science lessons

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
stop at water's edge.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This part's not going to be on the test."

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But that day I flew low over the islands --

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I saw forests and meadows.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I saw grottoes and secret gardens

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and places I'd love to hide as a kid,

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
if I could only breathe underwater.

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And best of all, I saw the animals.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
walking around on dry land,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but my head was down there, underwater.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Up until that day,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
these were the animals that were most common in my life.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These were the ones I'd like to draw --

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all variations of four legs and fur.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But when you got to the ocean,

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
my imagination was no competition for nature.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and this enormous humpback whale

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was like something out of a science-fiction movie.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
animals as big as office buildings

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
still swimming around out there in our ocean.

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the same fish they were 300 million years ago.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that's what a dinosaur looks like.

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So you have living dinosaurs

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and space aliens,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
could come up with something more interesting than that.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
make it look like it's floating in outer space.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and we saw that?

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It would start a whole new space race.

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
as a society.

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We say to ourselves,

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."

89
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So, what I'd like to do now

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is try a little drawing.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I love to draw the deep sea fish,

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because they are so ugly,

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but beautiful in their own way.

95
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --

96
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
give him a headlight,

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
maybe a brake light,

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
turn signals.

99
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But it's easy to see why these animals

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
make such great cartoon characters,

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
their shapes and sizes.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So some of them actually seem to have powers

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
like superheroes in a comic book.

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
For instance,

105
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
take these sea turtles.

106
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They kind of have a sixth sense

107
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like Superman's x-ray vision.

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And they can use that sense

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.

111
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I kind of give my turtle hands

112
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.

113
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Or take this sea cucumber.

114
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of

115
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or draw at all.

116
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
He's like an underwater Spiderman.

117
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He shoots out these sticky webs

118
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to entangle his enemy.

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,

120
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.

123
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Or the blowfish.

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.

126
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It can change its body

127
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
into a big, intimidating fish

128
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in a matter of seconds.

129
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.

130
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then I'm going to attempt

131
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
onscreen animation here.

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Let's see.

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Try and inflate it.

134
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself

136
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
when he wants to be intimidating.

137
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Or take this swordfish.

138
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?

139
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,

140
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Somebody's getting stabbed today."

141
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Or this lionfish for instance.

142
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Imagine trying to make friends

143
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.

144
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?

145
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
My characters are --

146
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
my lead character's a shark named Sherman.

147
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
He's a great white shark.

148
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.

149
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I didn't want to go with this ruthless

150
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
predator image.

151
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He's kind of just out there making a living.

152
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.

153
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then his sidekick

154
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.

155
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation

156
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.

157
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And he does manage to find them,

158
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.

159
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He never seems

160
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to settle on

161
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
any particular girl.

162
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,

163
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,

164
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so he kind of wishes

165
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
he were a great white shark.

166
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then I'll introduce you to one more character,

167
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
this guy, Ernest,

168
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
who is basically a juvenile delinquent

169
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in a fish body.

170
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So with characters, you can make stories.

171
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Sometimes making a story is as easy

172
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as putting two characters in a room

173
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and seeing what happens.

174
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.

175
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Or, sometimes I take them to places

177
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that people have never heard of because they're underwater.

178
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,

179
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.

180
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,

181
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where they met giant jellyfish.

182
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.

183
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This next one here,

184
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I did a story on the census of marine life.

185
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,

186
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it's a real project we've heard about.

187
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers

188
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to a lot of crazy undersea characters.

189
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So we start off the story with Ernest,

190
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
who volunteers as a census taker.

191
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.

192
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Then he meets the yeti crab,

193
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --

194
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life

195
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.

196
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I did another story on marine debris.

197
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was speaking to a lot of my friends

198
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in the conservation business,

199
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and they --

200
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"

201
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And they said -- this one friend of mine said,

202
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"I've got one word for you: plastic."

203
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.

204
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Plastic just is not going to do it."

205
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We sort of worked things out.

206
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,

207
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.

208
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I couldn't fit them in.

209
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.

210
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.

211
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What I'm trying to tell readers

212
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
is that plastic doesn't really go away;

213
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
it just continues to wash downstream.

214
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,

215
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,

216
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.

217
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,

218
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where they dropped a plastic bottle

219
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
into the Boise sewer system.

220
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And it ended up in the Boise River

221
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and then on to the Columbia River

222
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and then to the mouth of the Columbia

223
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and to the Pacific Ocean

224
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

225
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,

226
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --

227
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and then back onto the lagoon.

228
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So that was basically a buddy story

229
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with a plastic bottle following along.

230
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,

231
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but we really talked about marine debris and plastic

232
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in the course of that one.

233
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago

234
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
was probably my most difficult.

235
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly

236
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
about this issue.

237
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,

238
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.

239
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, finning is the act

240
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off

241
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and throwing the live animal back in the water.

242
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's cruel, it's wasteful.

243
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,

244
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but I really wanted to take this issue on.

245
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.

246
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,

247
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,

248
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
which he does.

249
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then he dies.

250
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.

251
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Ostensibly, he's dead now.

252
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.

253
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.

254
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.

255
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I do three or four strips after that

256
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where we explore the finning issue

257
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the shark fin soup issue.

258
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Sherman's up in shark heaven.

259
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is what I love about comic strips, you know.

260
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief

261
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because, if you start with a talking shark,

262
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.

263
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You can kind of do anything.

264
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.

265
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.

266
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
There was a real website based in China

267
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that actually sold shark fins,

268
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so I kind of exposed that.

269
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And he clicks the "buy now" button.

270
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And voila, next-day air, they show up,

271
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and they surgically reattach them.

272
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition

273
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,

274
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to force other countries

275
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to have a stronger stance with shark management.

276
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Applause)

277
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thanks.

278
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.

279
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,

280
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and this is what I came up with.

281
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Imagine you're in an enormous room,

282
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and it's as dark as a cave.

283
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,

284
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but you can't see anything.

285
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You've been given one tool, a hammer.

286
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,

287
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and it feels like it's made of stone.

288
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,

289
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.

290
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And you take the piece out into the daylight.

291
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.

292
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."

293
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So you go back into the room,

294
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.

295
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.

296
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.

297
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And you hear other people doing the same thing.

298
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So you get this sense of urgency,

299
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.

300
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And then some yells, "Stop!"

301
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And they turn up the lights.

302
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.

303
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,

304
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.

305
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And that's what we're doing with the ocean.

306
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And part of what Mission Blue is about

307
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is yelling, "Stop!"

308
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
so that each of us --

309
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --

310
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
can turn up the lights in their own way.

311
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.

312
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
That's why I like what I do.

313
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thanks for listening.

314
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person

2
0:00:15.927,000 --> 0:00:17,000
by looking at what's on their bookshelves.

3
0:00:19.679,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What do my bookshelves say about me?

4
0:00:22.402,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago,

5
0:00:26.11,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I made an alarming discovery.

6
0:00:29.131,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured,

7
0:00:32.159,000 --> 0:00:34,000
cosmopolitan sort of person.

8
0:00:34.608,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But my bookshelves told a rather different story.

9
0:00:38.439,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Pretty much all the titles on them

10
0:00:40.115,000 --> 0:00:42,000
were by British or North American authors,

11
0:00:42.998,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and there was almost nothing in translation.

12
0:00:46.327,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading

13
0:00:50.201,000 --> 0:00:51,000
came as quite a shock.

14
0:00:52.026,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame.

15
0:00:55.543,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there

16
0:00:58.939,000 --> 0:01:01,000
by writers working in languages other than English.

17
0:01:02.34,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant

18
0:01:05.666,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I would probably never encounter them.

19
0:01:08.435,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, I decided to prescribe myself

20
0:01:11.325,000 --> 0:01:13,000
an intensive course of global reading.

21
0:01:14.602,000 --> 0:01:17,000
2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK;

22
0:01:18.364,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it was the year of the London Olympics.

23
0:01:20.46,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so I decided to use it as my time frame

24
0:01:24.006,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to try to read a novel, short story collection

25
0:01:27.237,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or memoir from every country in the world.

26
0:01:32.771,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so I did.

27
0:01:34.128,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it was very exciting

28
0:01:35.779,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I learned some remarkable things

29
0:01:37.699,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and made some wonderful connections

30
0:01:39.838,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that I want to share with you today.

31
0:01:42.088,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But it started with some practical problems.

32
0:01:45.849,000 --> 0:01:49,000
After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world

33
0:01:50.54,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to use for my project,

34
0:01:52.77,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations,

35
0:01:55.944,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to which I added Taiwan,

36
0:01:57.191,000 --> 0:02:,000
which gave me a total of 196 countries.

37
0:02:01.143,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging

38
0:02:04.022,000 --> 0:02:06,000
about, roughly, four books a week

39
0:02:06.356,000 --> 0:02:09,000
around working five days a week,

40
0:02:09.491,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able

41
0:02:13.219,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to get books in English from every country.

42
0:02:16.546,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published

43
0:02:20.315,000 --> 0:02:22,000
each year in the UK are translations,

44
0:02:22.99,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world.

45
0:02:26.64,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Although, the proportion of translated books published

46
0:02:29.617,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in many other countries is a lot higher.

47
0:02:33.101,000 --> 0:02:36,000
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,

48
0:02:36.433,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but what that figure doesn't tell you

49
0:02:38.292,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is that many of those books will come from countries

50
0:02:40.989,000 --> 0:02:42,000
with strong publishing networks

51
0:02:43.187,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles

52
0:02:47.378,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to English-language publishers.

53
0:02:49.711,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French

54
0:02:54.307,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and published in the UK each year,

55
0:02:56.234,000 --> 0:03:,000
most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland.

56
0:03:01.107,000 --> 0:03:03,000
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,

57
0:03:03.869,000 --> 0:03:04,000
will rarely ever get a look-in.

58
0:03:06.284,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations

59
0:03:09.631,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that may have little or even no commercially available literature

60
0:03:13.286,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in English.

61
0:03:15.074,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Their books remain invisible to readers

62
0:03:18.164,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of the world's most published language.

63
0:03:22.002,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But when it came to reading the world,

64
0:03:23.844,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the biggest challenge of all for me

65
0:03:25.638,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was that fact that I didn't know where to start.

66
0:03:29.201,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British

67
0:03:32.583,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and North American books,

68
0:03:34.256,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories

69
0:03:37.869,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and choosing them from much of the rest of the world.

70
0:03:40.604,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland.

71
0:03:44.013,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.

72
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:48,000
There was no hiding it --

73
0:03:48.742,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was a clueless literary xenophobe.

74
0:03:52.541,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So how on earth was I going to read the world?

75
0:03:55.777,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I was going to have to ask for help.

76
0:03:57.658,000 --> 0:04:,000
So in October 2011, I registered my blog,

77
0:04:01.181,000 --> 0:04:02,000
ayearofreadingtheworld.com,

78
0:04:02.976,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I posted a short appeal online.

79
0:04:05.863,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I explained who I was,

80
0:04:07.116,000 --> 0:04:09,000
how narrow my reading had been,

81
0:04:09.148,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I asked anyone who cared to

82
0:04:11.029,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to leave a message suggesting what I might read

83
0:04:13.618,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from other parts of the planet.

84
0:04:15.913,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested,

85
0:04:20.01,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online,

86
0:04:23.148,000 --> 0:04:25,000
people started to get in touch.

87
0:04:25.608,000 --> 0:04:27,000
At first, it was friends and colleagues.

88
0:04:28.466,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Then it was friends of friends.

89
0:04:30.383,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And pretty soon, it was strangers.

90
0:04:33.399,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Four days after I put that appeal online,

91
0:04:36.225,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.

92
0:04:40.292,000 --> 0:04:42,000
She said she loved the sound of my project,

93
0:04:42.991,000 --> 0:04:44,000
could she go to her local English-language bookshop

94
0:04:45.914,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me?

95
0:04:49.912,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I accepted enthusiastically,

96
0:04:51.689,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and a few weeks later,

97
0:04:53.215,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a package arrived containing not one, but two books --

98
0:04:59.263,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,

99
0:05:02.908,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me.

100
0:05:08.428,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, at the time, I was amazed

101
0:05:10.889,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away

102
0:05:14.489,000 --> 0:05:15,000
would go to such lengths to help someone

103
0:05:16.438,000 --> 0:05:18,000
she would probably never meet.

104
0:05:19.1,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year.

105
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Time and again, people went out of their way to help me.

106
0:05:27.226,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Some took on research on my behalf,

107
0:05:29.859,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and others made detours on holidays and business trips

108
0:05:32.906,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to go to bookshops for me.

109
0:05:35.526,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It turns out, if you want to read the world,

110
0:05:38.786,000 --> 0:05:41,000
if you want to encounter it with an open mind,

111
0:05:42.211,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the world will help you.

112
0:05:45.118,000 --> 0:05:46,000
When it came to countries

113
0:05:46.357,000 --> 0:05:49,000
with little or no commercially available literature in English,

114
0:05:49.887,000 --> 0:05:5,000
people went further still.

115
0:05:52.689,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Books often came from surprising sources.

116
0:05:56.536,000 --> 0:05:59,000
My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation

117
0:05:59.599,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.

118
0:06:03.497,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account.

119
0:06:07.731,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And when I tweeted at it about my project,

120
0:06:10.129,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work

121
0:06:13.532,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan.

122
0:06:16.898,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message,

123
0:06:19.492,000 --> 0:06:21,000
asking if any of his Spanish-language novels

124
0:06:21.948,000 --> 0:06:22,000
had been translated into English.

125
0:06:24.432,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And he said that nothing had been published,

126
0:06:26.887,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but he did have an unpublished translation

127
0:06:29.341,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of his novel "The Golden Horse."

128
0:06:31.887,000 --> 0:06:32,000
He emailed this to me,

129
0:06:33.249,000 --> 0:06:36,000
allowing me to become one of the first people ever

130
0:06:36.407,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to read that book in English.

131
0:06:38.929,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith

132
0:06:41.603,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to share his work with me in this way.

133
0:06:44.015,000 --> 0:06:45,000
From Sweden to Palau,

134
0:06:45.801,000 --> 0:06:48,000
writers and translators sent me self-published books

135
0:06:49.816,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and unpublished manuscripts of books

136
0:06:51.57,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers

137
0:06:54.474,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or that were no longer available,

138
0:06:56.52,000 --> 0:07:,000
giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds.

139
0:07:02.008,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I read, for example,

140
0:07:03.183,000 --> 0:07:07,000
about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance

141
0:07:07.797,000 --> 0:07:09,000
against the Portuguese in the 19th century;

142
0:07:11.113,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and about marriage rituals in a remote village

143
0:07:13.908,000 --> 0:07:15,000
on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan.

144
0:07:18.524,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.

145
0:07:22.45,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:25.301,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.

147
0:07:32.87,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But perhaps the most amazing example

148
0:07:35.046,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of the lengths that people were prepared to go to

149
0:07:37.474,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to help me read the world,

150
0:07:39.125,000 --> 0:07:41,000
came towards the end of my quest,

151
0:07:41.598,000 --> 0:07:44,000
when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking

152
0:07:45.456,000 --> 0:07:48,000
African island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe.

153
0:07:49.364,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find

154
0:07:53.037,000 --> 0:07:56,000
a book that had been translated into English from the nation,

155
0:07:56.4,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it seemed as though the only option left to me

156
0:07:58.666,000 --> 0:08:01,000
was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch.

157
0:08:02.404,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now, I was really dubious

158
0:08:03.929,000 --> 0:08:05,000
whether anyone was going to want to help with this,

159
0:08:06.349,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and give up their time for something like that.

160
0:08:09.525,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook

161
0:08:13.812,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for Portuguese speakers,

162
0:08:15.79,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I had more people than I could involve in the project,

163
0:08:19.385,000 --> 0:08:23,000
including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field,

164
0:08:23.767,000 --> 0:08:28,000
who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.

165
0:08:30.443,000 --> 0:08:31,000
With my nine volunteers in place,

166
0:08:32.402,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I managed to find a book by a São Toméan author

167
0:08:35.014,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that I could buy enough copies of online.

168
0:08:37.548,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Here's one of them.

169
0:08:39.268,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers.

170
0:08:42.856,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection,

171
0:08:46.054,000 --> 0:08:49,000
stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me,

172
0:08:49.705,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.

173
0:08:54.422,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world,

174
0:08:58.908,000 --> 0:09:02,000
my not knowing and being open about my limitations

175
0:09:03.017,000 --> 0:09:05,000
had become a big opportunity.

176
0:09:05.935,000 --> 0:09:07,000
When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,

177
0:09:08.146,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it was a chance not only to learn something new

178
0:09:11.516,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and discover a new collection of stories,

179
0:09:14.215,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but also to bring together a group of people

180
0:09:17.185,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.

181
0:09:20.901,000 --> 0:09:23,000
My weakness had become the project's strength.

182
0:09:25.929,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things.

183
0:09:29.509,000 --> 0:09:31,000
As those who enjoy reading will know,

184
0:09:31.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself

185
0:09:35.524,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and into someone else's mindset,

186
0:09:37.692,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so that, for a while at least,

187
0:09:39.558,000 --> 0:09:41,000
you look at the world through different eyes.

188
0:09:42.39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That can be an uncomfortable experience,

189
0:09:44.877,000 --> 0:09:45,000
particularly if you're reading a book

190
0:09:46.673,000 --> 0:09:49,000
from a culture that may have quite different values to your own.

191
0:09:50.601,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But it can also be really enlightening.

192
0:09:53.402,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking.

193
0:09:57.742,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And it can also show up blind spots

194
0:09:59.933,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in the way you might have been looking at the world.

195
0:10:03.072,000 --> 0:10:05,000
When I looked back at much of the English-language literature

196
0:10:05.978,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I'd grown up with, for example,

197
0:10:07.688,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,

198
0:10:10.749,000 --> 0:10:12,000
compared to the richness that the world has to offer.

199
0:10:14.886,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And as the pages turned,

200
0:10:17.072,000 --> 0:10:19,000
something else started to happen, too.

201
0:10:20.15,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Little by little,

202
0:10:21.325,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed

203
0:10:25.634,000 --> 0:10:29,000
from a rather dry, academic register of place names

204
0:10:30.017,000 --> 0:10:32,000
into living, breathing entities.

205
0:10:33.475,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible

206
0:10:36.222,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book.

207
0:10:41.01,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But cumulatively, the stories I read that year

208
0:10:44.623,000 --> 0:10:47,000
made me more alive than ever before

209
0:10:47.707,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet.

210
0:10:54.654,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It was as though the world's stories

211
0:10:56.671,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them

212
0:11:00.595,000 --> 0:11:01,000
had made it real to me.

213
0:11:04.086,000 --> 0:11:06,000
These days, when I look at my bookshelves

214
0:11:06.645,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or consider the works on my e-reader,

215
0:11:09.794,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they tell a rather different story.

216
0:11:12.649,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's the story of the power books have to connect us

217
0:11:16.019,000 --> 0:11:2,000
across political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides.

218
0:11:21.422,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together.

219
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And, it's testament

220
0:11:27.686,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet,

221
0:11:32.333,000 --> 0:11:33,000
it's easier than ever before

222
0:11:34.274,000 --> 0:11:38,000
for a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book

223
0:11:38.727,000 --> 0:11:41,000
with someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet.

224
0:11:43.595,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come.

225
0:11:47.074,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And I hope many more people will join me.

226
0:11:49.947,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive

227
0:11:52.585,000 --> 0:11:54,000
for publishers to translate more books,

228
0:11:55.156,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we would all be richer for that.

229
0:11:57.713,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Thank you.

230
0:11:58.894,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.303,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years

3
0:00:19.868,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.

4
0:00:24.567,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.

5
0:00:28.564,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:30.629,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."

7
0:00:35.202,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"

8
0:00:40.357,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, yeah.

9
0:00:42.378,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.

10
0:00:46.375,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Let's go back before Christ, three millennia,

11
0:00:50.11,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,

12
0:00:54.477,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the march against inequality and poverty really began.

13
0:00:58.504,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Three thousand years ago,

14
0:00:59.987,000 --> 0:01:02,000
civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,

15
0:01:03.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,

16
0:01:06.945,000 --> 0:01:08,000
smelling of sheep shit, I guess,

17
0:01:09.853,000 --> 0:01:13,000
proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,

18
0:01:14.432,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."

19
0:01:19.916,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.

20
0:01:23.297,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."

21
0:01:26.565,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And they say, "No, no, that's what it says here

22
0:01:30.377,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in our holy book."

23
0:01:32.388,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids,

24
0:01:35.216,000 --> 0:01:37,000
another people spreading the same idea

25
0:01:37.454,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of equality with a different book.

26
0:01:39.445,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This time it's called the Facebook.

27
0:01:43.004,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.

28
0:01:44.896,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They turn a social network from virtual to actual,

29
0:01:47.309,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and kind of rebooted the 21st century.

30
0:01:50.799,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Not to undersell how messy and ugly

31
0:01:53.282,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,

32
0:01:56.03,000 --> 0:01:58,000
neither to oversell the role of technology,

33
0:01:58.805,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but these things have given a sense of what's possible

34
0:02:02.172,000 --> 0:02:06,000
when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,

35
0:02:06.531,000 --> 0:02:08,000
gets turned upside down, putting the people on top

36
0:02:09.343,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.

37
0:02:13.143,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's also shown us that something as powerful

38
0:02:16.218,000 --> 0:02:2,000
as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,

39
0:02:20.243,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because facts, like people,

40
0:02:23.206,000 --> 0:02:25,000
want to be free, and when they're free,

41
0:02:25.556,000 --> 0:02:26,000
liberty is usually around the corner,

42
0:02:27.227,000 --> 0:02:29,000
even for the poorest of the poor --

43
0:02:29.899,000 --> 0:02:31,000
facts that can challenge cynicism

44
0:02:32.444,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the apathy that leads to inertia,

45
0:02:35.326,000 --> 0:02:36,000
facts that tell us what's working and,

46
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,

47
0:02:39.893,000 --> 0:02:41,000
facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us

48
0:02:42.443,000 --> 0:02:45,000
meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made

49
0:02:45.977,000 --> 0:02:47,000
back in 2005,

50
0:02:48.502,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when he asked us to be that great generation

51
0:02:51.19,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,

52
0:02:54.253,000 --> 0:02:55,000
extreme poverty,

53
0:02:56.228,000 --> 0:03:,000
facts that build a powerful momentum.

54
0:03:00.327,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I thought, forget the rock opera,

55
0:03:02.915,000 --> 0:03:07,000
forget the bombast, my usual tricks.

56
0:03:08.041,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The only thing singing today would be the facts,

57
0:03:12.065,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for I have truly embraced by inner nerd.

58
0:03:17.503,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So exit the rock star.

59
0:03:23.791,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.

60
0:03:32.951,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Because what the facts are telling us

61
0:03:37.615,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is that the long, slow journey,

62
0:03:40.892,000 --> 0:03:42,000
humanity's long, slow journey of equality,

63
0:03:43.184,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is actually speeding up.

64
0:03:44.947,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Look at what's been achieved.

65
0:03:47.031,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Look at the pictures these data sets print.

66
0:03:50.381,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,

67
0:03:53.305,000 --> 0:03:54,000
there are eight million more AIDS patients

68
0:03:55.199,000 --> 0:03:57,000
getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.

69
0:03:57.93,000 --> 0:04:,000
Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa

70
0:04:01.167,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.

71
0:04:04.818,000 --> 0:04:07,000
For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,

72
0:04:08.498,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it's down by 2.65 million a year.

73
0:04:11.918,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.

74
0:04:18.531,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Wow. Wow. (Applause)

75
0:04:23.781,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.

76
0:04:26.069,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Have you read anything anywhere in the last week

77
0:04:29.899,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that is remotely as important as that number? Wow.

78
0:04:34.219,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Great news. It drives me nuts

79
0:04:38.207,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that most people don't seem to know this news.

80
0:04:41.095,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.

81
0:04:43.954,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is Michael and Benedicta,

82
0:04:46.632,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they're alive thanks in large part

83
0:04:49.283,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing --

84
0:04:53.184,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,

85
0:04:56.154,000 --> 0:04:57,000
whether you know it or not.

86
0:04:57.69,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs

87
0:05:00.608,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.

88
0:05:04.246,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.

89
0:05:07.421,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It was fought for, it was campaigned for,

90
0:05:09.296,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it was innovated for.

91
0:05:10.967,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And this great news gives birth to even more great news,

92
0:05:16.196,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because the historic trend is this.

93
0:05:19.076,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The number of people living in back-breaking,

94
0:05:21.684,000 --> 0:05:23,000
soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined

95
0:05:24.271,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990

96
0:05:29.361,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to 33 percent by 2000

97
0:05:32.265,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and then to 21 percent by 2010.

98
0:05:37.036,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Give it up for that. (Applause)

99
0:05:41.299,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Halved. Halved.

100
0:05:44.437,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people

101
0:05:48.737,000 --> 0:05:49,000
unnecessarily losing their lives.

102
0:05:50.715,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There's still work to do.

103
0:05:51.836,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.

104
0:05:57.488,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And if you live on less than $1.25 a day,

105
0:06:01.968,000 --> 0:06:03,000
if you live in that kind of poverty,

106
0:06:04.116,000 --> 0:06:05,000
this is not just data.

107
0:06:06.018,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This is everything.

108
0:06:07.897,000 --> 0:06:12,000
If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am --

109
0:06:13.696,000 --> 0:06:18,000
this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.

110
0:06:19.026,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And guess what? If the trajectory continues,

111
0:06:21.895,000 --> 0:06:25,000
look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day

112
0:06:26.432,000 --> 0:06:29,000
gets to by 2030.

113
0:06:30.064,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Can't be true, can it?

114
0:06:33.376,000 --> 0:06:37,000
That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,

115
0:06:37.764,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we get to, wow, the zero zone.

116
0:06:42.905,000 --> 0:06:43,000
For number-crunchers like us,

117
0:06:44.38,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that is the erogenous zone,

118
0:06:47.889,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it's fair to say that I am, by now,

119
0:06:51.08,000 --> 0:06:56,000
sexually aroused by the collating of data.

120
0:06:56.129,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So virtual elimination of extreme poverty,

121
0:07:01.39,000 --> 0:07:04,000
as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,

122
0:07:04.99,000 --> 0:07:08,000
adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.

123
0:07:09.387,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We do love a good baseline.

124
0:07:12.404,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's amazing.

125
0:07:14.125,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now I know that some of you think this progress

126
0:07:18.025,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is all in Asia or Latin America or

127
0:07:20.716,000 --> 0:07:21,000
model countries like Brazil --

128
0:07:22.048,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? --

129
0:07:24.94,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but look at sub-Saharan Africa.

130
0:07:29.05,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,

131
0:07:32.725,000 --> 0:07:34,000
who in the last decade have had a combination

132
0:07:35.453,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of 100 percent debt cancellation,

133
0:07:36.997,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI --

134
0:07:39.738,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that's foreign direct investment --

135
0:07:41.193,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that's local money --

136
0:07:45.115,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which, when spent wisely -- that's good governance --

137
0:07:47.779,000 --> 0:07:49,000
cut childhood mortality by a third,

138
0:07:50.049,000 --> 0:07:51,000
doubled education completion rates,

139
0:07:51.756,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and they, too, halved extreme poverty,

140
0:07:54.86,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.

141
0:07:59.289,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So the pride of lions

142
0:08:01.542,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is the proof of concept.

143
0:08:04.258,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There are all kinds of benefits to this.

144
0:08:07.689,000 --> 0:08:1,000
For a start, you won't have to listen

145
0:08:10.877,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.

146
0:08:15.229,000 --> 0:08:2,000
How about that? (Applause)

147
0:08:20.437,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.

148
0:08:24.475,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.

149
0:08:28.756,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.

150
0:08:34.083,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Makes us look really young.

151
0:08:37.77,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?

152
0:08:40.796,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.

153
0:08:44.507,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We can't get this done until we really accept

154
0:08:48.321,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that we can get this done.

155
0:08:50.796,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Look at this graph.

156
0:08:53.049,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.

157
0:08:57.867,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And the next one is really beautiful.

158
0:08:59.741,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's called momentum.

159
0:09:03.274,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And it's how we can bend the arc of history

160
0:09:07.83,000 --> 0:09:08,000
down towards zero,

161
0:09:09.458,000 --> 0:09:11,000
just doing the things that we know work.

162
0:09:11.857,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So inertia versus momentum.

163
0:09:13.902,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There is jeopardy, and of course,

164
0:09:16.443,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the closer you get, it gets harder.

165
0:09:18.815,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We know the obstacles that are in our way

166
0:09:20.759,000 --> 0:09:22,000
right now, in difficult times.

167
0:09:22.784,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,

168
0:09:27.925,000 --> 0:09:29,000
some who mind the nation's purse want to cut

169
0:09:30.5,000 --> 0:09:32,000
life-saving programs like the Global Fund.

170
0:09:32.905,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But you can do something about that.

171
0:09:34.718,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You can tell politicians

172
0:09:36.702,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that these cuts [can cost] lives.

173
0:09:39.608,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Right now today, in Oslo as it happens,

174
0:09:43.185,000 --> 0:09:45,000
oil companies are fighting to keep secret

175
0:09:45.552,000 --> 0:09:46,000
their payments to governments

176
0:09:47.03,000 --> 0:09:5,000
for extracting oil in developing countries.

177
0:09:50.747,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You can do something about that too.

178
0:09:52.466,000 --> 0:09:53,000
You can join the One Campaign,

179
0:09:54.326,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.

180
0:09:58.679,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some

181
0:10:02.502,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of the wealth under the ground

182
0:10:04.974,000 --> 0:10:07,000
ends up in the hands of the people living above it.

183
0:10:08.545,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And right now, we know

184
0:10:12.312,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that the biggest disease of all

185
0:10:16.024,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is not a disease. It's corruption.

186
0:10:18.987,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But there's a vaccine for that too.

187
0:10:20.811,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It's called transparency, open data sets,

188
0:10:24.302,000 --> 0:10:29,000
something the TED community is really on it.

189
0:10:29.313,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Daylight, you could call it, transparency.

190
0:10:32.925,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And technology is really turbocharging this.

191
0:10:35.487,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.

192
0:10:40.238,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So let me tell you about the U-report,

193
0:10:43.22,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials

194
0:10:46.827,000 --> 0:10:48,000
all across Uganda, young people

195
0:10:49.162,000 --> 0:10:53,000
armed with 2G phones, an SMS social network

196
0:10:53.538,000 --> 0:10:56,000
exposing government corruption

197
0:10:56.604,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and demanding to know what's in the budget

198
0:10:59.2,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and how their money is being spent.

199
0:11:02.063,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is exciting stuff.

200
0:11:04.738,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Look, once you have these tools,

201
0:11:08.101,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you can't not use them.

202
0:11:09.825,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Once you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.

203
0:11:12.351,000 --> 0:11:15,000
You can't delete this data from your brain,

204
0:11:15.626,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but you can delete the cliched image

205
0:11:18.449,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of supplicant, impoverished peoples

206
0:11:20.687,000 --> 0:11:22,000
not taking control of their own lives.

207
0:11:22.759,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You can erase that, you really can,

208
0:11:25.141,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because it's not true anymore. (Applause)

209
0:11:30.618,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's transformational.

210
0:11:33.47,000 --> 0:11:36,000
2030? By 2030, robots,

211
0:11:37.343,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.

212
0:11:40.137,000 --> 0:11:42,000
By the time we get there,

213
0:11:42.271,000 --> 0:11:45,000
every place with a rough semblance of governance

214
0:11:45.4,000 --> 0:11:49,000
might actually be on their way.

215
0:11:49.43,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I'm here to -- I guess we're here

216
0:11:53.235,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,

217
0:11:58.743,000 --> 0:12:,000
the one we call factivism.

218
0:12:00.793,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's not going to kill you.

219
0:12:02.437,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In fact, it could save countless lives.

220
0:12:06.53,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you

221
0:12:09.209,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.

222
0:12:14.246,000 --> 0:12:19,000
By doing so, you will join us and countless others

223
0:12:19.456,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,

224
0:12:24.419,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the ever-demanding journey of equality.

225
0:12:28.657,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Could we really be the great generation

226
0:12:31.894,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that Mandela asked us to be?

227
0:12:33.855,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Might we answer that clarion call with science,

228
0:12:37.835,000 --> 0:12:39,000
with reason, with facts,

229
0:12:40.494,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and, dare I say it, emotions?

230
0:12:44.532,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.

231
0:12:50.664,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.

232
0:12:53.151,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups

233
0:12:55.426,000 --> 0:12:59,000
behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.

234
0:12:59.529,000 --> 0:13:,000
He got thrown in jail for it,

235
0:13:01.079,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but I have his words tattooed on my brain.

236
0:13:05.802,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

237
0:13:10.289,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

238
0:13:13.414,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.

239
0:13:16.702,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We are going to win because the tears

240
0:13:18.673,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.

241
0:13:21.779,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We are going to win because we have dreams,

242
0:13:24.643,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and we're willing to stand up for those dreams."

243
0:13:28.153,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Wael is right.

244
0:13:30.466,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We're going to win

245
0:13:32.328,000 --> 0:13:34,000
if we work together as one,

246
0:13:34.56,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because the power of the people

247
0:13:37.004,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is so much stronger than the people in power.

248
0:13:40.828,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Thank you.

249
0:13:44.278,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

250
0:13:47.15,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you so much. (Applause)

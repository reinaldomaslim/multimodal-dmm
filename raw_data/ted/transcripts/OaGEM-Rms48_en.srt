1
0:00:12.52,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Periods.

2
0:00:14.12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Blood.

3
0:00:15.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Menstruation.

4
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Gross.

5
0:00:19.04,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Secret.

6
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Hidden.

7
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why?

8
0:00:24.76,000 --> 0:00:25,000
A natural biological process

9
0:00:26.68,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that every girl and woman goes through every month

10
0:00:30.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for about half of her life.

11
0:00:32.72,000 --> 0:00:34,000
A phenomenon that is so significant

12
0:00:35.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it.

13
0:00:40.48,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Yet we consider it a taboo.

14
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We feel awkward and shameful talking about it.

15
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When I got my first periods,

16
0:00:49.68,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was told to keep it a secret from others --

17
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
even from my father and brother.

18
0:00:55.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks,

19
0:00:58.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
our biology teacher skipped the subject.

20
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You know what I learned from it?

22
0:01:06.36,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it.

23
0:01:10.08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I learned to be ashamed of my body.

24
0:01:12.76,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I learned to stay unaware of periods

25
0:01:15.84,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in order to stay decent.

26
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Research in various parts of India

27
0:01:20.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
shows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation

28
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:26,000
at the time of their first periods.

29
0:01:27.4,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And in some parts of Rajasthan

30
0:01:29.04,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it.

31
0:01:34.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You'd be surprised to know

32
0:01:36.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that most of the girls that I have spoken to,

33
0:01:38.72,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation

34
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
thought that they have got blood cancer

35
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and they're going to die soon.

36
0:01:48.76,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor

37
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for reproductive tract infections.

38
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But in India, only 12 percent of girls and women

39
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:02:01,000
have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods.

40
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:03,000
If you do the math,

41
0:02:04.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods.

42
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I was one of them.

43
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,

44
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:17,000
where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful.

45
0:02:18.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So when I started getting my periods,

46
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I began with using rags.

47
0:02:24.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
After every use I would wash and reuse them.

48
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But to store them,

49
0:02:28.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating.

51
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse,

52
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I would often get rashes and infections using them.

53
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town.

54
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Another issue that periods brought in my life

55
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
those of the social restrictions

56
0:02:52.32,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods.

57
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think you all must be aware of it,

58
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but I'll still list it for the few who don't.

59
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.

60
0:03:05.84,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed.

61
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I had to wash my bed sheet after every period,

62
0:03:13.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
even if it was not stained.

63
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I was considered impure

64
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance.

65
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You'll find signposts outside temples

66
0:03:25.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
denying the entry of menstruating girls and women.

67
0:03:29.08,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Ironically,

68
0:03:30.48,000 --> 0:03:32,000
most of the time it is the older woman

69
0:03:33.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family.

70
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
After all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms.

71
0:03:42.56,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And in the absence of any intervention,

72
0:03:45.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it is the myth and misconception

73
0:03:47.64,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that propagate from generation to generation.

74
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
During my years of work in this field,

75
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I have even come across stories

76
0:03:54.64,000 --> 0:03:57,000
where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately.

77
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:,000
They're not allowed to take baths during periods,

78
0:04:00.64,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and in some households they are even secluded from other family members.

79
0:04:05.72,000 --> 0:04:08,000
About 85 percent of girls and women in India

80
0:04:09.28,000 --> 0:04:14,000
would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month.

81
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Can you imagine what this does

82
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl?

83
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The psychological trauma that this inflicts,

84
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:25,000
affecting her personality,

85
0:04:26.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
her academic performance

86
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years?

87
0:04:33.76,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years,

88
0:04:38.4,000 --> 0:04:4,000
until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,

89
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
changed my perception about menstruation forever.

90
0:04:44.28,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design.

91
0:04:49.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We fell in love with each other

92
0:04:51.44,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I was at ease discussing periods with him.

93
0:04:54.64,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Tuhin knew little about periods.

94
0:04:57.52,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:03.8,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps

96
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and we bleed every month.

97
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Yeah.

99
0:05:12.52,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He was completely shocked to know

100
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women

101
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:21,000
by their own families and their society.

102
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In order to help me with my cramps,

103
0:05:24.2,000 --> 0:05:27,000
he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation.

104
0:05:28.6,000 --> 0:05:29,000
When he shared his findings with me,

105
0:05:30.36,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself.

106
0:05:33.96,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths.

107
0:05:38.36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That's when we wondered:

108
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:41,000
if we, being so well educated,

109
0:05:42.28,000 --> 0:05:44,000
were so ill-informed about menstruation,

110
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:48,000
there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too.

111
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
To study --

112
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to understand the problem better,

113
0:05:52.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation

114
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the root cause behind it.

115
0:05:59.96,000 --> 0:06:,000
While it is generally believed

116
0:06:01.72,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon,

117
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
during my research,

118
0:06:08.96,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well.

119
0:06:11.96,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And it exists with the educated urban class, also.

120
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:19,000
While talking to many parents and teachers,

121
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods

122
0:06:25.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
before they have started getting their menstrual cycle.

123
0:06:28.84,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And --

124
0:06:30.08,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but they lacked the proper means themselves.

125
0:06:33.64,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And since it is a taboo,

126
0:06:34.92,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it.

127
0:06:38.84,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven,

128
0:06:43.48,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but our educational curriculum

129
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:48,000
teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine.

130
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And since it is a taboo,

131
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
teachers still skip the subject altogether.

132
0:06:56.84,000 --> 0:07:,000
So school does not teach girls about periods,

133
0:07:01.12,000 --> 0:07:03,000
parents don't talk about it.

134
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Where do the girls go?

135
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Two decades ago and now --

136
0:07:09.12,000 --> 0:07:1,000
nothing has changed.

137
0:07:12.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered:

138
0:07:14.96,000 --> 0:07:15,000
What if we could create something

139
0:07:16.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own --

140
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
something that would help parents and teachers

141
0:07:25.44,000 --> 0:07:27,000
talk about periods comfortably to young girls?

142
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:3,000
During my research,

143
0:07:31.48,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I was collecting a lot of stories.

144
0:07:33.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
These were stories of experiences of girls during their periods.

145
0:07:38.8,000 --> 0:07:41,000
These stories would make girls curious and interested

146
0:07:42.08,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in talking about menstruation in their close circle.

147
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's what we wanted.

148
0:07:47.52,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We wanted something that would make the girls curious

149
0:07:50.88,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and drive them to learn about it.

150
0:07:53.08,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods.

151
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:08:,000
So we decided to create a comic book,

152
0:08:00.48,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where the cartoon characters would enact these stories

153
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way.

154
0:08:08.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
To represent girls in their different phases of puberty,

155
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we have three characters.

156
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet,

157
0:08:16.76,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book

158
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and Mira who has already been getting her period.

159
0:08:23.56,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.

160
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Through her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up

161
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and menstrual hygiene management.

162
0:08:32.455,000 --> 0:08:33,000
While making the book, we took great care

163
0:08:34.423,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way

164
0:08:38.4,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and that it is culturally sensitive.

165
0:08:41.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
During our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book.

166
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They were keen on reading it

167
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and knowing more and more about periods on their own.

168
0:08:50.039,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods

169
0:08:53.08,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to young girls using the book,

170
0:08:54.799,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.

171
0:08:57.8,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Applause)

173
0:09:03.84,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The comic book helped in creating an environment

174
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:09,000
where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.

175
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls

176
0:09:14.8,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India.

177
0:09:18.76,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks

178
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.

179
0:09:24.4,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We made the final version of the book, called "Menstrupedia Comic"

180
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and launched in September last year.

181
0:09:31.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And so far,

182
0:09:32.52,000 --> 0:09:36,000
more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and --

183
0:09:36.88,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

184
0:09:39.56,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Thank you.

185
0:09:40.8,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Applause)

186
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And 10 different countries.

187
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We are constantly translating the book into different languages

188
0:09:52.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and collaborating with local organizations

189
0:09:54.96,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to make this book available in different countries.

190
0:09:57.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
15 schools in different parts of India

191
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:03,000
have made this book a part of their school curriculum

192
0:10:04.04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to teach girls about menstruation.

193
0:10:05.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

194
0:10:12.44,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I am amazed to see how volunteers,

195
0:10:17.8,000 --> 0:10:21,000
individuals, parents, teachers, school principals,

196
0:10:21.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
have come together

197
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities,

198
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:3,000
have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age

199
0:10:31.48,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and helped in breaking this taboo.

200
0:10:35.04,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse,

201
0:10:39.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
not a disease,

202
0:10:40.92,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but a welcoming change in a girl's life.

203
0:10:44.12,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And I would --

204
0:10:45.36,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

205
0:10:49.96,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And I would like to end this

206
0:10:51.36,000 --> 0:10:54,000
with a small request to all the parents here.

207
0:10:55.28,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Dear parents,

208
0:10:57.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
if you would be ashamed of periods,

209
0:10:59.48,000 --> 0:11:01,000
your daughters would be, too.

210
0:11:01.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So please be period positive.

211
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

212
0:11:05.44,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Thank you.

213
0:11:06.68,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Applause)

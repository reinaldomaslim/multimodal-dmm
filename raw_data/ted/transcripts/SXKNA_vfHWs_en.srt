1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I was born

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on the last day

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of the last year of the '70s.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(cheering)

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
hip-hop --

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop --

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and Anita Hill.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Cheering)

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
My parents were radicals --

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
who became,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
well, grown-ups.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
My dad facetiously says,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"We wanted to save the world,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and instead we just got rich."

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
We actually just got "middle class"

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but you get the picture.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I was raised with a very heavy sense

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of unfinished legacy.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
At this ripe old age of 30,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in this horrible, beautiful time,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I've decided, for me,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it's been a real journey and paradox.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The first paradox

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is that growing up is about rejecting the past

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then promptly reclaiming it.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Feminism was the water I grew up in.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
When I was just a little girl,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
my mom started what is now

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the longest-running women's film festival in the world.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was watching very esoteric documentaries

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
made by and about women.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You can see how this had an influence.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But she was not the only feminist in the house.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My dad actually resigned

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from the male-only business club in my hometown

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because he said he would never be part of an organization

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Applause)

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He's actually here today.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The trick here

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is my brother would become an experimental poet,

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not a businessman,

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but the intention was really good.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
even though it was all around me,

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because I associated it with my mom's women's groups,

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
none of which had much cachet

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the hallways of Palmer High School

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where I was trying to be cool at the time.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But I suspected there was something really important

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
about this whole feminism thing,

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and picking books off and reading them --

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I didn't actually claim the feminist label

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
until I went to Barnard College

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was responsible for my feminist click moment?

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Fishnet stockings.

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I thought they were really hot.

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now I tell you this --

75
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because I think part of the work of feminism

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that fun do matter.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There are lots of very modern political movements

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that have caught fire in no small part

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because of cultural hipness.

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but it looks very different.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
My mom says, "patriarchy."

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I say, "intersectionality."

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So race, class, gender, ability,

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
all of these things go into our experiences

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of what it means to be a woman.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But for me, so is immigration. (Applause)

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you.

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
My mom says, "Protest march."

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I say, "Online organizing."

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I co-edit, along with a collective

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of other super-smart, amazing women,

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a site called Feministing.com.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I tell you this

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because I think it's really important to see

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that there's a continuum.

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of consciousness raising.

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But we also have a straightforward political impact.

105
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Feministing has been able

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
fired from a Big Ten school.

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And one of our biggest successes

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So we're able to pull in the next generation

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in a totally new way.

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem."

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman,

118
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and on and on and on and on."

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We don't want one hero.

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We don't want one icon.

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We don't want one face.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We are thousands of women and men across this country

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
doing online writing, community organizing,

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
changing institutions from the inside out --

126
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all continuing the incredible work

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that our mothers and grandmothers started.

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Thank you.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Which brings me to the second paradox:

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
sobering up about our smallness

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and maintaining faith in our greatness

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
all at once.

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Many in my generation --

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education --

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
were socialized to believe

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that we were special little snowflakes --

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who were going to go out and save the world.

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
These are three words many of us were raised with.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We walk across graduation stages,

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
high on our overblown expectations,

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and when we float back down to earth,

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we realize we don't know what the heck it means

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to actually save the world anyway.

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The mainstream media often paints my generation

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as apathetic,

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I think it's much more accurate

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to say we are deeply overwhelmed.

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair --

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
an environmental crisis,

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
wealth disparity in this country

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
unlike we've seen since 1928,

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and globally,

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I experienced this firsthand myself

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I went out and I worked at a non-profit,

162
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I went to grad school, I phone-banked,

163
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I protested, I volunteered,

164
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and none of it seemed to matter.

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And on a particularly dark night

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of December of 2004,

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I sat down with my family,

168
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and I said that I had become very disillusioned.

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy --

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of writing a letter

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
about everything that was wrong with the world

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and then lighting myself on fire

173
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
on the White House steps.

174
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
My mom

175
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,

176
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
her eyes really welled with tears,

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and she looked right at me and she said,

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"I will not stand

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
for your desperation."

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She said, "You are smarter, more creative

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and more resilient than that."

182
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Which brings me to my third paradox.

183
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly

184
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and being fulfilled by failing really well.

185
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,

188
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed

189
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and a servile underestimation of ourselves."

191
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You may have guessed by now,

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I did not light myself on fire.

193
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.

194
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I wrote the book I needed to read.

195
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I wrote a book about eight incredible people

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
all over this country

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
doing social justice work.

198
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who's dedicating her life

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to environmental justice.

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I wrote about Emily Apt

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but quickly learned, not only did she not like it,

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but she wasn't really good at it.

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So she made a film about the welfare system

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and had a huge impact.

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,

211
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
who joined the military so she could afford college.

212
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and went on to co-organize a group

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
called the Service Women's Action Network.

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
What I learned from these people and others

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
was that I couldn't judge them

217
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.

218
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems --

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the military, congress,

220
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the education system, etc.

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But what they managed to do within those systems

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
was be a humanizing force.

223
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And at the end of the day,

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
what could possibly be more important than that?

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But how good a failure is it?"

227
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.

228
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's to say we operate on two levels.

229
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
On one,

230
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we really go after changing these broken systems

231
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of which we find ourselves a part.

232
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But on the other, we root our self-esteem

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
more kind, more just, etc.

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So when I was a little girl,

236
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I had a couple of very strange habits.

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
One of them was

238
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I would suck the thumb of my left hand

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.

243
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
She was talking about board meetings,

244
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
she was founding peace organizations,

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --

246
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
all these daily acts of care and creativity.

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And surely, at three and four years old,

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,

249
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.

250
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The activists I interviewed

251
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,

252
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which was that they all cited their mothers

253
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as their most looming and important

254
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
activist influences.

255
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So often, particularly at a young age,

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we look far afield

257
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
for our models of the meaningful life,

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and sometimes they're in our own kitchens,

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
talking on the phone, making us dinner,

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
doing all that keeps the world going around and around.

261
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
My mom and so many women like her

262
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
have taught me that life is not about glory,

263
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or certainty, or security even.

264
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's about embracing the paradox.

265
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.

266
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And it's about loving people really well.

267
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And at the end of the day,

268
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
these things make for a lifetime

269
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of challenge and reward.

270
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Thank you.

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

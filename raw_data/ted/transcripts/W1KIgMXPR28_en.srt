1
0:00:13.707,000 --> 0:00:15,000
People back home call me a heckler,

2
0:00:16.596,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a troublemaker, an irritant,

3
0:00:19.313,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a rebel, an activist,

4
0:00:21.983,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the voice of the people.

5
0:00:23.84,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But that wasn't always me.

6
0:00:26.65,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Growing up, I had a nickname.

7
0:00:28.182,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They used to call me Softy,

8
0:00:30.502,000 --> 0:00:33,000
meaning the soft, harmless boy.

9
0:00:33.755,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Like every other human being, I avoided trouble.

10
0:00:36.495,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In my childhood, they taught me silence.

11
0:00:38.538,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Don't argue, do as you're told.

12
0:00:40.34,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In Sunday school, they taught me don't confront, don't argue,

13
0:00:44.272,000 --> 0:00:47,000
even if you're right, turn the other cheek.

14
0:00:47.585,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This was reinforced by the political climate of the time.

15
0:00:52.182,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.783,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Kenya is a country where you are guilty

17
0:00:57.592,000 --> 0:00:59,000
until proven rich.

18
0:01:00.239,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:02.984,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Kenya's poor are five times more likely

20
0:01:05.726,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them

21
0:01:08.65,000 --> 0:01:09,000
than by criminals.

22
0:01:10.298,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This was reinforced by the political climate of the day.

23
0:01:12.945,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We had a president, Moi, who was a dictator.

24
0:01:15.894,000 --> 0:01:17,000
He ruled the country with an iron fist,

25
0:01:18.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and anyone who dared question his authority

26
0:01:20.538,000 --> 0:01:24,000
was arrested, tortured, jailed or even killed.

27
0:01:25.507,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.

28
0:01:29.431,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Being a coward was not an insult.

29
0:01:31.474,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Being a coward was a compliment.

30
0:01:33.401,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother.

31
0:01:36.559,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What that meant: that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive.

32
0:01:40.32,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I used to question this advice,

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya,

34
0:01:45.082,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and the results were violently disputed.

35
0:01:47.565,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What followed that election was terrible violence, rape,

36
0:01:52.302,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the killing of over 1,000 people.

37
0:01:56.239,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My work was to document the violence.

38
0:01:59.36,000 --> 0:02:01,000
As a photographer, I took thousands of images,

39
0:02:02.216,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and after two months,

40
0:02:04.283,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the two politicians came together, had a cup of tea,

41
0:02:09.158,000 --> 0:02:12,000
signed a peace agreement, and the country moved on.

42
0:02:12.595,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand.

43
0:02:16.124,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I saw the killings. I saw the displacement.

44
0:02:19.73,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I met women who had been raped, and it disturbed me,

45
0:02:22.811,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but the country never spoke about it.

46
0:02:24.855,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We pretended. We all became smart cowards.

47
0:02:27.339,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it.

48
0:02:30.938,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Ten months later, I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore.

49
0:02:34.235,000 --> 0:02:36,000
After quitting my job, I decided to organize my friends

50
0:02:36.83,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to speak about the violence in the country,

51
0:02:38.85,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to speak about the state of the nation,

52
0:02:40.714,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and June 1, 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium

53
0:02:44.83,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and try and get the president's attention.

54
0:02:46.889,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's a national holiday,

55
0:02:48.329,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it's broadcast across the country,

56
0:02:49.978,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I showed up at the stadium.

57
0:02:53.386,000 --> 0:02:55,000
My friends did not show up.

58
0:02:56.38,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I found myself alone,

59
0:02:59.753,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I didn't know what to do.

60
0:03:02.28,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I was scared,

61
0:03:03.695,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I knew very well that that particular day,

62
0:03:05.865,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I had to make a decision.

63
0:03:07.086,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Was I able to live as a coward, like everyone else,

64
0:03:09.509,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or was I going to make a stand?

65
0:03:11.107,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And when the president stood up to speak,

66
0:03:13.313,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I found myself on my feet shouting at the president,

67
0:03:17.92,000 --> 0:03:2,000
telling him to remember the post-election violence victims,

68
0:03:21.114,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to stop the corruption.

69
0:03:23.39,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And suddenly, out of nowhere,

70
0:03:25.595,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the police pounced on me like hungry lions.

71
0:03:28.707,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They held my mouth

72
0:03:30.564,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and dragged me out of the stadium,

73
0:03:32.491,000 --> 0:03:34,000
where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail.

74
0:03:37.112,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail,

75
0:03:43.87,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and that got me thinking.

76
0:03:46.518,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What was making me feel this way?

77
0:03:48.389,000 --> 0:03:51,000
My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did,

78
0:03:51.554,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the images that I took were disturbing my life.

79
0:03:56.568,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans.

80
0:03:59.518,000 --> 0:04:,000
Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

81
0:04:01.465,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It was a story to them.

82
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition

83
0:04:05.947,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to show the images of the violence across the country

84
0:04:08.733,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and get people talking about it.

85
0:04:10.707,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We traveled the country and showed the images,

86
0:04:13.516,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path,

87
0:04:16.999,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where I decided to become silent no more,

88
0:04:19.716,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to talk about those things.

89
0:04:21.914,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We traveled, and our general site from our street exhibit

90
0:04:25.564,000 --> 0:04:29,000
became for political graffiti about the situation in the country,

91
0:04:30.362,000 --> 0:04:32,000
talking about corruption, bad leadership.

92
0:04:33.12,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We have even done symbolic burials.

93
0:04:36.9,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament

94
0:04:40.882,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as a symbol of our politicians' greed.

95
0:04:42.81,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It has been done in Uganda and other countries,

96
0:04:45.041,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media

97
0:04:48.55,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and amplified across the country, across the continent.

98
0:04:51.586,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago,

99
0:04:54.233,000 --> 0:04:57,000
now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me.

100
0:04:57.259,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things.

101
0:05:02.177,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country,

102
0:05:06.35,000 --> 0:05:07,000
who want to bring about change,

103
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and they're no longer afraid, and they're no longer smart cowards.

104
0:05:13.744,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So that was my story.

105
0:05:18.242,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That day in the stadium,

106
0:05:20.84,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I stood up as a smart coward.

107
0:05:23.327,000 --> 0:05:28,000
By that one action, I said goodbye to the 24 years living as a coward.

108
0:05:28.574,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There are two most powerful days in your life:

109
0:05:31.616,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the day you're born, and the day you discover why.

110
0:05:36.771,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President,

111
0:05:40.015,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I discovered why I was truly born,

112
0:05:43.295,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice.

113
0:05:47.776,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Do you know why you were born?

114
0:05:51.7,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Thank you.

115
0:05:53.535,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Applause)

116
0:06:00.524,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.

117
0:06:03.031,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I just want to ask you a couple quick questions.

118
0:06:05.587,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So PAWA254:

119
0:06:07.907,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you've created a studio, a place where young people can go

120
0:06:12.22,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and harness the power of digital media

121
0:06:14.176,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to do some of this action.

122
0:06:16.687,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What's happening now with PAWA?

123
0:06:18.564,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Boniface Mwangi: So we have this community of filmmakers,

124
0:06:21.347,000 --> 0:06:24,000
graffiti artists, musicians, and when there's an issue in the country,

125
0:06:24.71,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we come together, we brainstorm, and take up on that issue.

126
0:06:27.511,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So our most powerful tool is art,

127
0:06:29.567,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life,

128
0:06:33.398,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and they don't have time to read.

129
0:06:35.465,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So we package our activism and we package our message in art.

130
0:06:39.598,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So from the music, the graffiti, the art, that's what we do.

131
0:06:45.557,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Can I say one more thing?

132
0:06:47.585,000 --> 0:06:48,000
TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)

133
0:06:49.466,000 --> 0:06:51,000
BM: In spite of being arrested, beaten up, threatened,

134
0:06:52.101,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the moment I discovered my voice,

135
0:06:53.814,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that I could actually stand up for what I really believed in,

136
0:06:56.71,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm no longer afraid.

137
0:06:57.748,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I used to be called softy, but I'm no longer softy,

138
0:07:00.49,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because I discovered who I really am, as in, that's what I want to do,

139
0:07:03.891,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and there's such beauty in doing that.

140
0:07:06.927,000 --> 0:07:09,000
There's nothing as powerful as that, knowing that I'm meant to do this,

141
0:07:10.316,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because you don't get scared, you just continue living your life.

142
0:07:13.463,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Thank you.

143
0:07:15.649,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Applause)

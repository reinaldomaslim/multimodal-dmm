1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We stood on the railroad tracks

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that ran between my friend's house and the beach.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but at that point the water had receded

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to a level three or four feet below normal.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'd never seen the reef here before.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They were trying to catch fish.

11
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
No one realized that this was a very bad idea.

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The people on the tracks just continued to watch them.

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I turned around to check on my friend's house.

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
Then someone on the tracks screamed.

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.

16
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.

17
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The children managed to run back onto the tracks.

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.

19
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks

20
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.

21
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It continued to rise.

22
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.

23
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,

24
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that he would rather die there than run.

25
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house

26
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to get his dog, who was apparently afraid.

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.

28
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The slum built on the railroad reservation

29
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.

30
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,

31
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and no one was there when the water rose.

32
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.

33
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --

34
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
all of this was from the houses in the slum.

35
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.

36
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This may seem hard to believe --

37
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --

38
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.

39
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes

40
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --

41
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,

42
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.

43
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
One of the scariest things about the tsunami

44
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.

45
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor

46
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,

47
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...

48
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,

49
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to catch a boat to the hospital.

50
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.

51
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,

52
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,

53
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.

54
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We don't think another wave is coming right away.

55
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
At the Phi Phi Hill Resort,

56
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,

57
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but I strained to listen for information.

58
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,

59
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which triggered the massive tsunami.

60
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Having this news was comforting in some small way

61
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to understand what had just happened to us.

62
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
However, the report focused on what had already occurred

63
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and offered no information on what to expect now.

64
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,

65
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours

66
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
knew anything with any certainty.

67
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs

68
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that essentially sprang up after it occurred.

69
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami

70
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that also were shown on blogs.

71
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I should warn you, they're pretty powerful.

72
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.

73
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Screaming)

74
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Voice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.

75
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Voice 2: It's coming again?

76
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.

77
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Voice 2: Come get inside here.

78
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Voice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?

79
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Voice 1: It's coming again. New wave!

80
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
[Unclear]

81
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Screaming)

82
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They called me out here.

83
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
James Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.

84
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,

85
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,

86
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
although initially -- that is, in that first day --

87
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video

88
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and some people complained about this.

89
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They said, "The blogsters let us down."

90
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
What became very clear was that,

91
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,

92
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened

93
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in a way that we never had been able to get before.

94
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected

95
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with

96
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense

97
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.

98
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,

99
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.

100
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of --

101
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the sublime in the traditional sense of the word,

102
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.

103
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because when we think about blogs,

104
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I think for most of us who are concerned about them,

105
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.

106
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I want to ask three questions in this talk,

107
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.

108
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,

109
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
about what motivates people to do things?

110
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility

111
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of accessing a kind of collective intelligence

112
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?

113
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then the third part is, What are the potential problems,

114
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
or the dark side of blogs as we know them?

115
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
OK, the first question:

116
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What do they tell us about why people do things?

117
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,

118
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and, of course, the Internet more generally --

119
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and it's going to seem like a very obvious point,

120
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but I think it is an important one to think about --

121
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content

122
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,

123
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,

124
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are doing so primarily for free.

125
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,

126
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.

127
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
And this is -- at least, to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable,

128
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because the traditional account of economic man would say that,

129
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.

130
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But instead, what we're finding on the Internet --

131
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way

132
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to work together without any money involved at all.

133
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.

134
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"

135
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,

136
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.

137
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,

138
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,

139
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who are producing enormous amounts of material

140
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for no reason other than to tell their stories.

141
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.

142
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities

143
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for organizing a whole host of activities down the road.

144
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us

145
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,

146
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,

147
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or, you have to pay for it to be good,

148
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products

149
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
without any money at all changing hands.

150
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --

151
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few

152
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,

153
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it

154
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or they love the attention, or whatever it is.

155
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this

156
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and, I think, is writing about this more,

157
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but this notion of voluntary cooperation

158
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.

159
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,

160
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in terms of accessing collective intelligence?

161
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."

162
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,

163
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.

164
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
And they can actually often be smarter

165
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
than even the smartest person within them.

166
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people

167
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.

168
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If I had a jar of jellybeans

169
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,

170
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
your average guess would be remarkably good.

171
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent

172
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
of the number of beans in the jar,

173
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.

174
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,

175
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but for the most part the group's guess

176
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
would be better than just about all of you.

177
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work

178
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in many more complicated situations.

179
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,

180
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.

181
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack

182
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.

183
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
You know, if you think about something like Google,

184
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web

185
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --

186
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,

187
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing

188
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,

189
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
or a remarkable intelligence in it.

190
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.

191
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Dan Gillmor -- whose book "We the Media"

192
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is included in the gift pack --

193
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
has talked about it as saying that, as a writer,

194
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
he's recognized that his readers know more than he does.

195
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea

196
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone

197
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,

198
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion

199
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that he or she knows better than everyone else.

200
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility

201
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,

202
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and that we know is available to us

203
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.

204
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Each blog post, each blog commentary

205
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
may not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,

206
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,

207
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
more often than not is going to give you a very interesting

208
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and enormously valuable picture of what's going on.

209
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So, that's the positive side of it.

210
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
That's the positive side of what is sometimes called

211
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
participatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --

212
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that, in fact, we are giving people

213
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
who have never been able to talk before a voice,

214
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and we're able to access information that has always been there

215
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but has essentially gone untapped.

216
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But there is a dark side to this,

217
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.

218
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,

219
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,

220
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.

221
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,

222
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
bottom-up structure of the Internet.

223
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things --

224
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that being linked from one place to another,

225
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.

226
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And much of the time it is.

227
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --

228
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,

229
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.

230
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,

231
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
once you are linked in the network,

232
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the network starts to shape your views

233
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.

234
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.

235
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
A network is not just the product of its component parts.

236
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It is something more than that.

237
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.

238
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now, this has all these benefits:

239
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;

240
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
it gives you access to a whole host of people;

241
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.

242
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But the problem is that groups are only smart

243
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
when the people in them are as independent as possible.

244
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,

245
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
or the paradox of collective intelligence,

246
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.

247
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And networks make it harder for people to do that,

248
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because they drive attention to the things that the network values.

249
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere

250
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is that once a meme, once an idea gets going,

251
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,

252
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
because other people have, say, a link.

253
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.

254
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And that phenomenon

255
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
of piling on the existing links

256
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,

257
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
particularly of the political blogosphere,

258
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
and it is one that essentially throws off

259
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence

260
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.

261
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.

262
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
A lot of people talk about ants.

263
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.

264
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,

265
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,

266
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
no individual ant knows what it's doing,

267
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.

268
0:15:29.123,000 --> 0:15:32,000
They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible,

269
0:15:32.204,000 --> 0:15:36,000
they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed.

270
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So, the ant colony is a great model:

271
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.

272
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But we know that occasionally ants go astray,

273
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,

274
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
they start to follow a simple rule --

275
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
just do what the ant in front of you does.

276
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.

277
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long

278
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around

279
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
in a circle until they died.

280
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.

281
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
That's the thing we have to fear --

282
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.

283
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,

284
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
because one of the great things about the tsunami --

285
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
in terms of the blogosphere's coverage,

286
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
not in terms of the tsunami itself --

287
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.

288
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.

289
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view

290
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
in a way that they hadn't before.

291
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.

292
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.

293
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.

294
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

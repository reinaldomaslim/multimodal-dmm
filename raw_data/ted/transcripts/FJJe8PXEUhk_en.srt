0:00:13.02,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let me introduce you to

2
0:00:14.749,000 --> 0:00:15,000
something I've been working on.

3
0:00:16.652,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's what the Victorian illusionists

4
0:00:18.463,000 --> 0:00:22,000
would have described as a mechanical marvel,

5
0:00:22.909,000 --> 0:00:23,000
an automaton,

6
0:00:24.392,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a thinking machine.

7
0:00:26.355,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Say hello to EDI.

8
0:00:28.605,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.

9
0:00:30.972,000 --> 0:00:33,000
EDI, EDI.

10
0:00:34.943,000 --> 0:00:36,000
These mechanical performers were popular

11
0:00:37.82,000 --> 0:00:38,000
throughout Europe.

12
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Audiences marveled at the way they moved.

13
0:00:41.98,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It was science fiction made true,

14
0:00:44.555,000 --> 0:00:47,000
robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,

15
0:00:48.373,000 --> 0:00:5,000
machines far in advance of anything

16
0:00:50.937,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that Victorian technology could create,

17
0:00:53.508,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a machine we would later know

18
0:00:56.483,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as the robot.

19
0:00:58.171,000 --> 0:01:01,000
EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921

20
0:01:01.757,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in a science fiction tale

21
0:01:03.605,000 --> 0:01:05,000

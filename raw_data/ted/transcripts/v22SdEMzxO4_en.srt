2
0:00:15.579,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.

3
0:00:19.162,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,

4
0:00:22.795,000 --> 0:00:23,000
if they're to work at all.

5
0:00:24.112,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So think, for instance,

6
0:00:25.279,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,

7
0:00:28.897,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,

8
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or a parent with complex child care needs.

9
0:00:34.527,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Their availability for work can be such that it's,

10
0:00:37.685,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"A few hours today.

11
0:00:39.378,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."

12
0:00:42.978,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people

13
0:00:45.497,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to find the work that they so often need very badly.

14
0:00:48.526,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Which is a tragedy because there are employers

15
0:00:51.345,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who can use pools of very flexible local people

16
0:00:54.651,000 --> 0:00:57,000
booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.

17
0:00:58.55,000 --> 0:01:,000
Imagine that you run a cafe.

18
0:01:01.151,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.

19
0:01:02.818,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.

20
0:01:04.401,000 --> 0:01:07,000
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes

21
0:01:07.718,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to start in an hour's time,

22
0:01:10.372,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.

23
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.

24
0:01:17.206,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.

25
0:01:20.373,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,

26
0:01:24.305,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.

27
0:01:27.688,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,

28
0:01:30.006,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.

29
0:01:33.305,000 --> 0:01:37,000
There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,

30
0:01:37.838,000 --> 0:01:4,000
possibly already once they've been inducted.

31
0:01:40.989,000 --> 0:01:42,000
At this level of the labor market,

32
0:01:43.022,000 --> 0:01:46,000
what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.

33
0:01:46.872,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They do exist. Here's how they work.

34
0:01:48.989,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So in this example, a distribution company has said,

35
0:01:52.456,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.

36
0:01:55.739,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Show us everyone who's available.

37
0:01:57.139,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's found 31 workers.

38
0:01:58.79,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.

39
0:02:02.322,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They're all contactable in time for this booking.

40
0:02:04.656,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.

41
0:02:08.657,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.

42
0:02:12.071,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.

43
0:02:14.632,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.

44
0:02:16.556,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You can select as many of them as you want.

45
0:02:18.771,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They're from multiple agencies.

46
0:02:20.223,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.

47
0:02:24.155,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it's monitoring their reliability.

48
0:02:26.489,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.

49
0:02:29.489,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They're likely to be more expensive.

50
0:02:31.238,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,

51
0:02:34.439,000 --> 0:02:35,000
here's a market research company,

52
0:02:36.122,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.

53
0:02:40.072,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.

54
0:02:42.757,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted

55
0:02:46.156,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are available each hour next week.

56
0:02:48.438,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.

57
0:02:51.172,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But is there more that could be done

58
0:02:53.789,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for this corner of the labor market?

59
0:02:55.539,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Because right now there are so many people

60
0:02:58.225,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.

61
0:03:01.823,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Let's make it personal.

62
0:03:03.873,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,

63
0:03:06.656,000 --> 0:03:08,000
very little prospect of getting a job --

64
0:03:08.856,000 --> 0:03:11,000
what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?

65
0:03:12.572,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours

66
0:03:14.856,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.

67
0:03:18.156,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She may be interested in providing local services to her community:

68
0:03:21.488,000 --> 0:03:23,000
babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.

69
0:03:24.039,000 --> 0:03:27,000
She may have possessions that she would like to trade

70
0:03:27.176,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at times she doesn't need them.

71
0:03:28.422,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.

72
0:03:32.021,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.

73
0:03:36.189,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware --

74
0:03:39.59,000 --> 0:03:41,000
yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,

75
0:03:42.155,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so she can go online and do all this.

76
0:03:43.915,000 --> 0:03:45,000
She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,

77
0:03:46.573,000 --> 0:03:49,000
she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.

78
0:03:50.457,000 --> 0:03:55,000
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.

79
0:03:55.807,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.

80
0:04:02.421,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,

81
0:04:06.972,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but only for organizations at the top of the economy.

82
0:04:10.656,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted

83
0:04:13.656,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets

84
0:04:16.572,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,

85
0:04:20.155,000 --> 0:04:23,000
executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.

86
0:04:23.808,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It analyzes supply and demand and pricing

87
0:04:27.24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.

88
0:04:29.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.

89
0:04:32.883,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's all extremely low overhead.

90
0:04:35.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What have we gained at the bottom of the economy

91
0:04:38.318,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in terms of markets in the last 20 years?

92
0:04:42.412,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Basically classified adverts with a search facility.

93
0:04:48.571,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So why do we have this disparity

94
0:04:50.584,000 --> 0:04:53,000
between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy

95
0:04:54.134,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource

96
0:04:57.75,000 --> 0:05:,000
out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,

97
0:05:01.199,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and what the rest of us have?

98
0:05:03.583,000 --> 0:05:06,000
A modern market is more than a website;

99
0:05:06.649,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,

100
0:05:09.268,000 --> 0:05:11,000
back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,

101
0:05:11.802,000 --> 0:05:15,000
settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.

102
0:05:16.699,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,

103
0:05:19.85,000 --> 0:05:24,000
she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today

104
0:05:25.049,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then post that listing on multiple websites

105
0:05:27.665,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and wait for potential buyers to get in touch

106
0:05:30.165,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.

107
0:05:33.882,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In the early days of this modern markets technology,

108
0:05:36.781,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the financial institutions worked out

109
0:05:38.849,000 --> 0:05:41,000
how they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,

110
0:05:42.481,000 --> 0:05:44,000
their relationships, their networks

111
0:05:44.781,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.

112
0:05:49.371,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,

113
0:05:52.46,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and in a lot of cases they got it.

114
0:05:55.094,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But throughout the economy,

115
0:05:57.044,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there are facilities that could likewise leverage

116
0:05:59.862,000 --> 0:06:,000
a new generation of markets

117
0:06:01.461,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for the benefit of all of us.

118
0:06:04.194,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And those facilities --

119
0:06:06.162,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,

120
0:06:09.878,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the licensing authorities

121
0:06:12.161,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,

122
0:06:15.994,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.

123
0:06:19.662,000 --> 0:06:21,000
These mechanisms, these facilities

124
0:06:22.511,000 --> 0:06:25,000
are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,

125
0:06:26.06,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they're controlled by the state.

126
0:06:29.162,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the policymakers who sit on top of them

127
0:06:31.893,000 --> 0:06:37,000
are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used

128
0:06:38.111,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to underpin a whole new era of markets.

129
0:06:40.894,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted

130
0:06:45.611,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that modern markets are the preserve

131
0:06:47.879,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.

132
0:06:55.79,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.

133
0:06:59.217,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,

134
0:07:02.383,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or the leader of any other developed nation,

135
0:07:04.565,000 --> 0:07:07,000
woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create

136
0:07:08.416,000 --> 0:07:1,000
all the jobs I need in the current climate.

137
0:07:10.582,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.

138
0:07:15.916,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.

139
0:07:19.883,000 --> 0:07:21,000
How do I make that happen?"

140
0:07:22.251,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.

141
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?

142
0:07:28.782,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.

143
0:07:32.312,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Not necessarily.

144
0:07:35.317,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There is a precedent for technology-enabled service

145
0:07:38.165,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries

146
0:07:41.867,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and has been hugely successful:

147
0:07:44.683,000 --> 0:07:46,000
national lotteries.

148
0:07:47.133,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Let's take Britain as an example.

149
0:07:48.883,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Our government didn't design the national lottery,

150
0:07:51.483,000 --> 0:07:53,000
it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.

151
0:07:54.266,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.

152
0:07:59.417,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This act defines what a national lottery will look like.

153
0:08:02.682,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It specifies certain benefits

154
0:08:04.35,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.

155
0:08:07.033,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And it puts some obligations on those operators.

156
0:08:09.732,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,

157
0:08:13.082,000 --> 0:08:16,000
this was an unqualified success.

158
0:08:16.116,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But let's suppose that our aim

159
0:08:17.9,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.

160
0:08:21.783,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Could we use the same model?

161
0:08:23.933,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I believe we could.

162
0:08:25.717,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.

163
0:08:29.833,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.

164
0:08:33.817,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Think of it as a regulated public utility.

165
0:08:35.666,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.

166
0:08:38.55,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade

167
0:08:42.666,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.

168
0:08:45.483,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And government has certain benefits

169
0:08:48.232,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it can uniquely bestow on these markets.

170
0:08:50.782,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's about public spending going through these markets

171
0:08:53.566,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to buy public services at the local level.

172
0:08:56.165,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's about interfacing these markets

173
0:08:57.9,000 --> 0:09:,000
direct into the highest official channels in the land.

174
0:09:01.55,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.

175
0:09:04.95,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's about deregulating some sectors

176
0:09:07.732,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so that local people can enter them.

177
0:09:09.165,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, taxi journeys might be one example.

178
0:09:11.417,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits

179
0:09:16.199,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to be placed on the operators,

180
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the key one is, of course,

181
0:09:19.3,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that the operators pay for everything,

182
0:09:22.166,000 --> 0:09:25,000
including all the interfacing into the public sector.

183
0:09:25.167,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So imagine that the operators make their return

184
0:09:28.733,000 --> 0:09:31,000
by building a percentage markup into each transaction.

185
0:09:31.916,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Imagine that there's a concession period

186
0:09:34.35,000 --> 0:09:36,000
defined of maybe 15 years

187
0:09:36.783,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in which they can take all these benefits and run with them.

188
0:09:41.249,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,

189
0:09:44.566,000 --> 0:09:47,000
whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction

190
0:09:48.199,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to fund the whole thing

191
0:09:49.691,000 --> 0:09:5,000
will get the deal.

192
0:09:51.066,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So government then exits the frame.

193
0:09:52.866,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This is now in the hands of the consortium.

194
0:09:54.499,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity

195
0:09:57.05,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and make a percentage on all of it

196
0:09:59.134,000 --> 0:10:,000
or it's all going to crash and burn,

197
0:10:00.733,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which is tough on their shareholders.

198
0:10:02.35,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.

199
0:10:04.8,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.

200
0:10:09.45,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So this would just be one more choice

201
0:10:11.883,000 --> 0:10:13,000
among millions of Internet forums.

202
0:10:14.699,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But it could be very different,

203
0:10:17.249,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because having access to those state-backed facilities

204
0:10:20.867,000 --> 0:10:22,000
could incentivize this consortium

205
0:10:23.2,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to seriously invest in the service.

206
0:10:25.317,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going

207
0:10:28.384,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to start making their return.

208
0:10:30.115,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care,

209
0:10:35.006,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the hire of toys, farm work,

210
0:10:38.963,000 --> 0:10:41,000
hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,

211
0:10:42.582,000 --> 0:10:43,000
services for tourists, home care.

212
0:10:44.389,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,

213
0:10:51.172,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because national e-markets will deliver data.

214
0:10:55.039,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So this is a local person

215
0:10:57.672,000 --> 0:11:,000
potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.

216
0:11:00.672,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training

217
0:11:03.521,000 --> 0:11:04,000
if they wanted to go into that market.

218
0:11:04.921,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents

219
0:11:07.539,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who wanted a pool of babysitters.

220
0:11:09.039,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Is it worth their while?

221
0:11:10.44,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Should they be looking at other sectors?

222
0:11:12.14,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Should they be moving to another part of the country

223
0:11:14.024,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where there's a shortage of babysitters?

224
0:11:16.273,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This kind of data can become routine.

225
0:11:18.623,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And this data can be used by investors.

226
0:11:20.657,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country

227
0:11:23.823,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,

228
0:11:26.722,000 --> 0:11:27,000
an investor can pay for it

229
0:11:28.306,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals

230
0:11:31.99,000 --> 0:11:32,000
for maybe the next two years.

231
0:11:33.639,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is a world of atomized capitalism.

232
0:11:36.94,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So it's small trades by small people,

233
0:11:38.972,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.

234
0:11:45.839,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Some rough research suggests this could unlock

235
0:11:48.764,000 --> 0:11:52,000
around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity

236
0:11:52.965,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in a country the size of the U.K.

237
0:11:54.915,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Does that sound improbable to you?

238
0:11:57.648,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading

239
0:12:01.781,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in financial exchanges 20 years ago.

240
0:12:04.833,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Do not underestimate the transformative power

241
0:12:07.933,000 --> 0:12:1,000
of truly modern markets.

242
0:12:11.089,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Thank you.

243
0:12:12.715,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I'm 11 years old.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
First of all, I would like to say

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
all the marketing and advertising

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on TV, at public schools

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and pretty much everywhere else you look.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It seems to me like corporations

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
are always trying to get kids, like me,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to get their parents to buy stuff

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that really isn't good for us or the planet.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Little kids, especially,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
are attracted by colorful packaging

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and plastic toys.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I must admit, I used to be one of them.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I also used to think that all of our food

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
came from these happy, little farms

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What I discovered was this is not true.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I began to look into this stuff

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
on the Internet, in books and in documentary films,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in my travels with my family.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to do something not intended by nature --

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
like taking the DNA of a fish

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but this is just creepy.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The seeds are then planted, then grown.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The food they produce have been proven

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and people have been eating food produced this way

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
since the 1990s.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And most folks don't even know they exist.

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Yet almost all the corn we eat

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has been altered genetically in some way.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And let me tell you,

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
corn is in everything.

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
called CAFOS.

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
made from fossil fuels

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
from growing the same crop over and over again.

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
like pesticides and herbicides,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to kill weeds and bugs.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or run off into our waterways,

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
poisoning our water too.

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so it can travel thousands of miles

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I ask myself,

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
how can I change? How can I change these things?

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is what I found out.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now a while back,

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I wanted to be an NFL football player.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Thank you.

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because he grows against the system.

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Since I'm home-schooled,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I went to go hear him speak one day.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This man, this "lunatic farmer,"

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or genetically modified seeds.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I want you to know that we can all make a difference

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
by making different choices,

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
by buying our food directly from local farmers,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or our neighbors who we know in real life.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but is it really?

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
With all these things I've been learning about the food system,

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or we can pay the hospital.

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I want you to know that there are farms out there --

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
whose cows do eat grass

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so I can see up close and personal

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where the meat I eat comes from.

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I want you to know that I believe

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in every community popping up.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
actually like eating baked kale chips.

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I try to share this everywhere I go.

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Not too long ago,

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or the sugarcoated flakes --

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
My little cousin told his dad

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
one kid at a time.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Thank you.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.34,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I took a cell phone

2
0:00:15.38,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and accidentally made myself famous.

3
0:00:19.06,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.78,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was just talking about the things that I cared about,

5
0:00:23.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but with the click of a button

6
0:00:26.06,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and an incendiary viral video

7
0:00:28.98,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I propelled myself into overnight stardom.

8
0:00:32.42,000 --> 0:00:33,000
When I say overnight,

9
0:00:33.98,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I mean I literally woke up the next morning

10
0:00:36.06,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with so many notifications on my phone,

11
0:00:38.38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I thought I slept through a national tragedy.

12
0:00:40.86,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:45.42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It was the craziest thing, guys,

14
0:00:47.58,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but when it came to my influence and my exposure,

15
0:00:50.94,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I literally took a quantum leap.

16
0:00:53.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I made more videos

17
0:00:55.9,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and the subject matter of my videos

18
0:00:58.34,000 --> 0:01:02,000
was often the most divisive subject in American life,

19
0:01:02.7,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but it was the way that I articulated race

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that made me somewhat of a digital lightning rod.

21
0:01:08.14,000 --> 0:01:11,000
See, being a survivor myself of police brutality

22
0:01:11.42,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and having lost a childhood friend,

23
0:01:13.74,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Alonzo Ashley,

24
0:01:15.34,000 --> 0:01:16,000
at the hands of the police,

25
0:01:17.139,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I had a little something to say about the topic.

26
0:01:19.82,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You see, this was at the height of the Black Lives Matter furor

27
0:01:23.22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and people seemed to be turning to me to articulate their viewpoints,

28
0:01:26.5,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.

29
0:01:29.5,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You see, the internet has this interesting quality.

30
0:01:32.18,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In one way, it totally brought the world together,

31
0:01:35.3,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I remember being a kid

32
0:01:36.98,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and all of this utopian propaganda was being dumped on us

33
0:01:41.18,000 --> 0:01:42,000
about how the World Wide Web

34
0:01:43.02,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was going to span the reaches of people across the globe.

35
0:01:46.62,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But as it turns out, people are people.

36
0:01:49.5,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:51.14,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And this magical superhighway

38
0:01:54.02,000 --> 0:01:55,000
also took the demons of our nature

39
0:01:55.94,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and gave them Ferraris.

40
0:01:57.58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:02.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You see, technology, y'all, is a lot like money.

42
0:02:05.86,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It just brings out what's already inside you and amplifies it.

43
0:02:09.46,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And so I soon became familiar with the phenomenon of the internet troll.

44
0:02:16.66,000 --> 0:02:18,000
These guys seem to live beneath the bridges

45
0:02:19.22,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of said superhighway --

46
0:02:20.859,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And they also missed the memo about the enlightenment of the internet age.

48
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I remember being called

49
0:02:32.66,000 --> 0:02:34,000
highly colorful racial slurs

50
0:02:35.5,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by those who use the anonymity of the internet

51
0:02:38.18,000 --> 0:02:39,000
as a Klan hood.

52
0:02:40.38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And some of them were pretty creative, actually,

53
0:02:43.22,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but others were pretty wounding,

54
0:02:46.3,000 --> 0:02:48,000
especially navigating the post-traumatic world

55
0:02:49.1,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of a police brutality survivor

56
0:02:51.62,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the height of Black Lives Matter,

57
0:02:53.78,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with all of these people being killed on my timeline.

58
0:02:57.78,000 --> 0:02:59,000
To these trolls, I wasn't a human.

59
0:02:59.98,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was an idea, an object,

60
0:03:02.42,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a caricature.

61
0:03:03.82,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Did I mention that this race stuff can be kind of divisive?

62
0:03:07.02,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You see, I'm an innately curious person

63
0:03:09.9,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and as I drew my sword to engage in epic battles in the comment section --

64
0:03:14.82,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:20.94,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I also began to notice

66
0:03:24.14,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that a few of my trolls actually had brains,

67
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which made me even more curious and what to understand them even further.

68
0:03:31.54,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And although these supposed morons

69
0:03:34.58,000 --> 0:03:37,000
engaged in what appeared to be original thought,

70
0:03:37.94,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I said to myself,

71
0:03:39.82,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,

72
0:03:42.54,000 --> 0:03:43,000
at least according to my knowledge."

73
0:03:44.98,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Where are these guys getting these arguments from?

74
0:03:47.38,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Like, was there some kind of alternative universe

75
0:03:49.74,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with alternative facts?

76
0:03:51.02,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:54.02,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

78
0:04:01.34,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Was history and gravity optional over there?

79
0:04:04.66,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I don't know.

80
0:04:07.7,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But I needed to know. Like, I wanted to know.

81
0:04:10.7,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And as it turns out, I had no idea about digital echo chambers.

82
0:04:16.1,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That same target marketing algorithm

83
0:04:18.14,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that feeds you more of the products you like to buy

84
0:04:20.82,000 --> 0:04:23,000
also feeds you more of the news that you like to hear.

85
0:04:23.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I had been living in an online universe

86
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that just reflected my worldview back to me.

87
0:04:29.339,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So my timeline was pretty liberal.

88
0:04:31.18,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I had no Breitbart or Infowars or Fox News.

89
0:04:35.06,000 --> 0:04:38,000
No, no, I was all MSNBC and The Daily Show,

90
0:04:40.1,000 --> 0:04:42,000
CNN and theGrio, right?

91
0:04:42.34,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well, these trolls were hopping the dimensional doorway

92
0:04:46.22,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I needed to figure out how.

93
0:04:48.3,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:54.54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So what I decided to do

95
0:04:57.14,000 --> 0:04:59,000
was trick the Facebook algorithm

96
0:04:59.54,000 --> 0:05:02,000
into feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with,

97
0:05:02.9,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough,

98
0:05:05.74,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because my online footprint

99
0:05:07.22,000 --> 0:05:09,000
already established the patterns that I like to hear.

100
0:05:10.14,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So with the anonymity of the internet,

101
0:05:12.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I went undercover.

102
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:17.38,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I set up this ghost profile and went crazy.

104
0:05:22.18,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, on a practical level, it was very simple,

105
0:05:25.98,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but on an emotional level, it was kind of daunting,

106
0:05:28.78,000 --> 0:05:31,000
especially with the racist vitriol that I had experienced.

107
0:05:32.22,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But what I didn't realize is that my trolls were inoculating me,

108
0:05:36.7,000 --> 0:05:37,000
thickening my skin,

109
0:05:38.34,000 --> 0:05:41,000
making me immune to viewpoints that I didn't necessarily agree with,

110
0:05:42.18,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and so I didn't react to the same things as I would have several months prior.

111
0:05:46.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
All right? So I pressed on.

112
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Noticing that this stuff also worked on YouTube,

113
0:05:52.14,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker --

114
0:05:57.18,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:04.58,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And digitally I began to infiltrate the infamous alt-right movement.

116
0:06:09.98,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, my doppelgänger

117
0:06:11.86,000 --> 0:06:14,000
was Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character --

118
0:06:15.54,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:18.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
a sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier.

120
0:06:21.94,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And to think, like, years ago, I would have needed acting training

121
0:06:25.66,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and, like, makeup and a fake ID.

122
0:06:28.58,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now I could just lurk.

123
0:06:30.98,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And so I started

124
0:06:34.42,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with a little Infowars,

125
0:06:36.42,000 --> 0:06:38,000
went on into some American Renaissance,

126
0:06:38.9,000 --> 0:06:4,000
National Vanguard Alliance,

127
0:06:41.18,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and, you know, I started commenting on videos,

128
0:06:44.06,000 --> 0:06:46,000
talking bad about Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter.

129
0:06:47.34,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I started bemoaning race baiters like Eric Holder and Barack Obama

130
0:06:54.06,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and just mirroring the antiblack sentiments

131
0:06:56.82,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that were thrown at me.

132
0:06:58.5,000 --> 0:07:,000
And to be honest, it was kind of exhilarating.

133
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:05.34,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Like, I would literally spend days clicking through my new racist profile --

135
0:07:09.58,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:12.78,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Goofing off at work in Aryan land. It was something else.

137
0:07:17.02,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

138
0:07:19.18,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so I then started visiting some of the pages

139
0:07:23.58,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of my former trolls,

140
0:07:25.54,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and a lot of these guys were just regular Joes,

141
0:07:29.34,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a lot of outdoorsmen, hunters, computer nerds,

142
0:07:33.14,000 --> 0:07:36,000
some of them family guys with videos of their families.

143
0:07:36.3,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all could be in this room right now. Right?

144
0:07:39.944,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But when I went undercover, I found a lovely plethora of characters,

146
0:07:48.38,000 --> 0:07:54,000
luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and David Duke.

147
0:07:54.42,000 --> 0:07:57,000
All of these guys were thought leaders in their own right,

148
0:07:57.78,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but over time, the alt-right movement ended up using their information

149
0:08:02.54,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to fuel their momentum.

150
0:08:04.22,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I'm going to tell you what else led to the momentum of the alt-right:

151
0:08:07.7,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the left wing's wholesale demonization of everything white and male.

152
0:08:13.46,000 --> 0:08:16,000
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, you're in league with Satan.

153
0:08:17.18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:24.94,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, would you believe,

155
0:08:27.14,000 --> 0:08:29,000
would you believe that some people find that offensive?

156
0:08:31.22,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And --

157
0:08:32.46,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:33.62,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And so, I mean, listen,

159
0:08:36.38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the fact is that millennials get a lifetime of diet brand history.

160
0:08:41.86,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I mean, America seems to be hellbent on filling its textbooks

161
0:08:46.34,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with CliffsNotes versions of its dark past.

162
0:08:49.66,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This severely, severely decontextualizes race and the anger associated with it,

163
0:08:55.979,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow.

164
0:08:59.18,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Add in the wild landscape of the internet

165
0:09:02.22,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it's easy to sell rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas

166
0:09:06.54,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to a generation who has been failed by public schools.

167
0:09:09.86,000 --> 0:09:12,000
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.

168
0:09:12.9,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Alt-facts have that quality.

169
0:09:14.78,000 --> 0:09:19,000
However, one theme kept screaming at me through the subtext of those arguments,

170
0:09:20.14,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and that was,

171
0:09:22.06,000 --> 0:09:25,000
why should I be hated for who I cannot help but be?

172
0:09:26.34,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, as a black man in America, that resonated with me.

173
0:09:29.18,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I have spent so much time

174
0:09:31.22,000 --> 0:09:33,000
defending myself against attempts to demonize me

175
0:09:34.06,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and make me apologize for who I am,

176
0:09:36.42,000 --> 0:09:38,000
trying to portray me as something that I'm not,

177
0:09:38.66,000 --> 0:09:4,000
some kind of thug or gangster, a menace to society.

178
0:09:41.82,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Unexpected compassion.

179
0:09:44.38,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Wow.

180
0:09:45.62,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now, listen,

181
0:09:47.18,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the historical source of the demonization of black males and white males

182
0:09:51.78,000 --> 0:09:52,000
is highly different,

183
0:09:53.14,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and where you fall on this argument,

184
0:09:55.66,000 --> 0:09:57,000
sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.

185
0:09:58.98,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, you're probably surprised by this perspective,

186
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and so was I.

187
0:10:05.02,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Never in a billion years did I think that I could have some kind of compassion

188
0:10:08.74,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for people who hated my guts.

189
0:10:11.06,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now, mind you, not enough compassion like I want to be friends.

190
0:10:14.06,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I don't have infinite olive branches to extend to people

191
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
who, like, would not want to see me on this planet. Right?

192
0:10:21.06,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But just enough compassion to understand how they got to where they are.

193
0:10:25.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And to be honest,

194
0:10:27.22,000 --> 0:10:29,000
there were a couple of fair points.

195
0:10:29.3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
One of them was how liberals have this wide acceptance for everybody

196
0:10:34.82,000 --> 0:10:37,000
except for those with honestly held conservative viewpoints.

197
0:10:38.06,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:40.7,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Heaven forbid you love God, this country and mean it. Right?

199
0:10:45.94,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And another thing that they talked about was this fear that they had

200
0:10:49.18,000 --> 0:10:52,000
of something that they labeled as "white genocide,"

201
0:10:52.3,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that diversity would be a force that would wipe them out.

202
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Now listen, I know what it is to fear

203
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:,000
for the fate of your people.

204
0:11:01.06,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,

205
0:11:04.02,000 --> 0:11:08,000
mass incarceration, gentrification, police shootings,

206
0:11:08.22,000 --> 0:11:1,000
black people have more than enough reasons to stay up at night.

207
0:11:11.74,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But if nature is into diversity and you are not,

208
0:11:14.66,000 --> 0:11:16,000
you're going to lose that fight, buddy.

209
0:11:16.98,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

210
0:11:19.82,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Applause)

211
0:11:26.94,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You see, nature doesn't care about your race. That's man-made.

212
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Nature just cares about healthy organisms,

213
0:11:32.34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and your precious ethnic features are expendable to that aim.

214
0:11:36.58,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So the moment that you let go of that racist identity

215
0:11:40.9,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and relatch onto humanity,

216
0:11:42.74,000 --> 0:11:43,000
all your problems go away.

217
0:11:44.3,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

218
0:11:51.86,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I'm going to tell you what race ain't about to die out:

219
0:11:54.9,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the human race.

220
0:11:56.14,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Join the party. The water's great.

221
0:11:59.521,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Until the water gets too hot, but that's another TED Talk.

222
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:06.58,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The point is that to get to this point of understanding,

224
0:12:10.66,000 --> 0:12:11,000
you have to let go of that fear

225
0:12:12.46,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and embrace your curiosity,

226
0:12:14.18,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and sadly, too many people will not take that journey

227
0:12:17.66,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to see the world from the other side.

228
0:12:20.7,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And, I mean, let's be honest,

229
0:12:22.3,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that doesn't just go for progressives,

230
0:12:24.46,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but also to the right wing and conservatives.

231
0:12:26.74,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You know, as fair as some of their points were,

232
0:12:28.98,000 --> 0:12:3,000
they were still trapped in their own echo chambers,

233
0:12:31.42,000 --> 0:12:33,000
recycling old, outdated points of view,

234
0:12:33.82,000 --> 0:12:35,000
never getting a diversity in perspective,

235
0:12:36.38,000 --> 0:12:38,000
not making them well-rounded in their worldview.

236
0:12:39.14,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So they're not hearing certain anti-racist and political voices,

237
0:12:43.98,000 --> 0:12:44,000
voices like Tim Wise

238
0:12:45.98,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.

239
0:12:51.46,000 --> 0:12:54,000
All of these voices have the answers to the questions that they want,

240
0:12:55.42,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but unfortunately they will not hear them due to the power of these echo chambers.

241
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We have got to break out of these digital divides,

242
0:13:03.94,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because as our technology advances,

243
0:13:06.58,000 --> 0:13:09,000
the consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous.

244
0:13:10.1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And this whole experience taught me something:

245
0:13:13.74,000 --> 0:13:14,000
our gadgets ain't going to save us.

246
0:13:16.18,000 --> 0:13:18,000
All these technological devices

247
0:13:19.18,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here.

248
0:13:23.9,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.

249
0:13:27.18,000 --> 0:13:28,000
That's a dangerous imbalance.

250
0:13:29.02,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Where do you get the emotional intelligence,

251
0:13:31.86,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the character development,

252
0:13:33.74,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the virtues of patience, forbearance, compassion,

253
0:13:36.46,000 --> 0:13:4,000
you know, the things that make sure that these devices, however advanced,

254
0:13:40.66,000 --> 0:13:41,000
become a blessing and not a curse?

255
0:13:43.22,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Seems to be me that humanity itself needs an upgrade.

256
0:13:48.54,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Now --

257
0:13:49.78,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

258
0:13:54.66,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's a big task, understandably,

259
0:13:57.34,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but I don't believe in any kind of unbeatable monster.

260
0:14:00.1,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There was no giant out there without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.

261
0:14:04.38,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And what if I told you

262
0:14:05.74,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that one of the best ways to actually overcome this

263
0:14:09.54,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is to have courageous conversations

264
0:14:12.78,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with difficult people,

265
0:14:15.02,000 --> 0:14:18,000
people who do not see the world the same way that you see the world?

266
0:14:18.46,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Oh yes, folks, conversations may be indeed the key to that upgrade,

267
0:14:23.34,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because remember,

268
0:14:24.9,000 --> 0:14:27,000
language was the first form of virtual reality.

269
0:14:27.94,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It is literally a symbolic representation of the physical world,

270
0:14:32.06,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and through this device, we change the physical world.

271
0:14:35.14,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,

272
0:14:38.3,000 --> 0:14:4,000
conversations start countries,

273
0:14:40.46,000 --> 0:14:41,000
they build bridges,

274
0:14:41.74,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and when the chips are down,

275
0:14:43.3,000 --> 0:14:45,000
conversations are the last tools that humans use

276
0:14:45.98,000 --> 0:14:46,000
before they pick up their guns.

277
0:14:48.1,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I ain't talking about online safe conversations

278
0:14:50.94,000 --> 0:14:51,000
from the security of your laptop.

279
0:14:52.58,000 --> 0:14:53,000
No.

280
0:14:54.02,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I'm talking about in-your-face conversations with real, breathing people.

281
0:14:58.74,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And for me, this looks like running a community forum

282
0:15:01.98,000 --> 0:15:02,000
called Shop Talk Live.

283
0:15:03.9,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now, in Shop Talk Live -- somebody's been there, right?

284
0:15:07.46,000 --> 0:15:08,000
In Shop Talk Live,

285
0:15:09.46,000 --> 0:15:11,000
we have the conversations that change lives.

286
0:15:11.94,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We meet the community right where they are,

287
0:15:14.74,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and we've done everything from divert gang violence in real time

288
0:15:19.18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to help find people jobs

289
0:15:20.86,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to mentoring homeless youth.

290
0:15:23.02,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And the reason why we needed to do this

291
0:15:24.94,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is because there was a severe lack of trust in the black community

292
0:15:29.06,000 --> 0:15:32,000
due to the violence of the crack era.

293
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And so we ended up taking agency into our own hands,

294
0:15:35.54,000 --> 0:15:36,000
solving our own problems,

295
0:15:37.1,000 --> 0:15:39,000
not waiting for anybody else.

296
0:15:39.18,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And the truth is,

297
0:15:40.42,000 --> 0:15:41,000
from the mayor to the felon,

298
0:15:41.82,000 --> 0:15:43,000
you're going to find them in that barber shop.

299
0:15:44.02,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And so what we did was just organize what was already going on.

300
0:15:47.06,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And so what I started doing was mining these alternative viewpoints

301
0:15:50.82,000 --> 0:15:52,000
from these alternative digital universes,

302
0:15:53.14,000 --> 0:15:57,000
dissecting them, breaking them down into controversial talking points.

303
0:15:57.7,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Then, with my cell phone,

304
0:16:00.3,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I flipped the internet against itself

305
0:16:02.38,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and began to broadcast these live conversations

306
0:16:05.14,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to my online followers.

307
0:16:06.86,000 --> 0:16:09,000
This made them want to leave the safety of their laptops

308
0:16:09.9,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and meet us in person to have real conversations

309
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
with real people in real life.

310
0:16:14.54,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And we did this. Thank you.

311
0:16:16.02,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Applause)

312
0:16:22.74,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Sometimes I sit back, and I reflect on the paradox

313
0:16:26.5,000 --> 0:16:28,000
of me just trying to solve the problems,

314
0:16:28.74,000 --> 0:16:31,000
us trying to solve the problems in our own communities --

315
0:16:31.78,000 --> 0:16:33,000
we build bridges to so many other communities,

316
0:16:34.18,000 --> 0:16:37,000
from the LGBTQ community to the Arab immigrant community

317
0:16:37.82,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and even sat down with somebody with a Confederate flag on their hat

318
0:16:41.78,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and talked about the things that actually matter.

319
0:16:44.5,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It is time that we stop trying

320
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to hack our way around the human experience.

321
0:16:49.62,000 --> 0:16:51,000
There is no way out of each other.

322
0:16:51.7,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Stop trying to find one.

323
0:16:54.06,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

324
0:16:56.38,000 --> 0:16:59,000
We have to understand something.

325
0:17:00.1,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Human beings all want the same things

326
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and we have to go through each other to get these things.

327
0:17:04.98,000 --> 0:17:07,000
These courageous conversations are the way that these bridges are built.

328
0:17:08.66,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It's time that we start seeing people as people

329
0:17:11.22,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and not simply the ideas that we project onto them or react to.

330
0:17:15.18,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Human beings are not the barriers

331
0:17:17.899,000 --> 0:17:19,000
but the gateways to the very things that we want.

332
0:17:20.899,000 --> 0:17:22,000
This is a collective and conscious evolution.

333
0:17:24.38,000 --> 0:17:29,000
My journey began with a terribly popular cell phone video

334
0:17:29.54,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and a fallen friend.

335
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Your journey begins right about now.

336
0:17:34.74,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Join the renaissance in human connection.

337
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
It is going to happen with or without you.

338
0:17:40.02,000 --> 0:17:43,000
My suggestion: pick a topic, and start a community dialogue

339
0:17:43.94,000 --> 0:17:44,000
in your neck of the woods.

340
0:17:45.78,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Meet folks back in real life.

341
0:17:47.58,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And I'm going to tell you,

342
0:17:49.14,000 --> 0:17:51,000
when you trick the algorithm of your existence,

343
0:17:51.54,000 --> 0:17:53,000
you will get some diversified experiences.

344
0:17:54.66,000 --> 0:17:55,000
It is time to grow, people.

345
0:17:56.5,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And when we do this, not if,

346
0:17:58.46,000 --> 0:18:01,000
it will be clear that the key to this upgrade

347
0:18:02.02,000 --> 0:18:05,000
was always our inner world, not some device that we create,

348
0:18:05.98,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and the doorways to this experience is now,

349
0:18:09.3,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and will forever be, each other.

350
0:18:12.1,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Thank you.

351
0:18:13.9,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Applause)

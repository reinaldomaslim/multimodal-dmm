1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: You were something of a mathematical phenom.

2
0:00:15.675,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age.

3
0:00:18.763,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And then the NSA came calling.

4
0:00:21.464,000 --> 0:00:22,000
What was that about?

5
0:00:23.207,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Jim Simons: Well the NSA -- that's the National Security Agency --

6
0:00:27.154,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they didn't exactly come calling.

7
0:00:29.465,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians

8
0:00:33.963,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to attack secret codes and stuff like that.

9
0:00:37.294,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I knew that existed.

10
0:00:39.315,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And they had a very good policy,

11
0:00:41.519,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because you could do half your time at your own mathematics,

12
0:00:45.393,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and at least half your time working on their stuff.

13
0:00:49.559,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And they paid a lot.

14
0:00:51.057,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So that was an irresistible pull.

15
0:00:54.132,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So, I went there.

16
0:00:56.068,000 --> 0:00:57,000
CA: You were a code-cracker.

17
0:00:57.43,000 --> 0:00:58,000
JS: I was.

18
0:00:58.62,000 --> 0:00:59,000
CA: Until you got fired.

19
0:00:59.801,000 --> 0:01:,000
JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.

20
0:01:01.408,000 --> 0:01:02,000
CA: How come?

21
0:01:03.28,000 --> 0:01:04,000
JS: Well, how come?

22
0:01:05.611,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on,

23
0:01:10.591,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war

24
0:01:16.353,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story,

25
0:01:20.772,000 --> 0:01:21,000
about how we would win in Vietnam.

26
0:01:22.566,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid.

27
0:01:25.719,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published,

28
0:01:28.408,000 --> 0:01:32,000
saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor,

29
0:01:32.446,000 --> 0:01:36,000
if anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views.

30
0:01:37.553,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I gave my own views ...

31
0:01:39.235,000 --> 0:01:41,000
CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would --

32
0:01:41.423,000 --> 0:01:43,000
JS: ... which were different from General Taylor's.

33
0:01:44.002,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But in the end, nobody said anything.

34
0:01:45.932,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around

35
0:01:49.657,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine

36
0:01:52.769,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views.

37
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I told him, "I'm doing mostly mathematics now,

38
0:02:02.083,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff."

39
0:02:06.123,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day --

40
0:02:08.972,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I told my local boss that I gave that interview.

41
0:02:13.153,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And he said, "What'd you say?"

42
0:02:14.636,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I told him what I said.

43
0:02:16.126,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And then he said, "I've got to call Taylor."

44
0:02:18.465,000 --> 0:02:2,000
He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.

45
0:02:20.866,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I was fired five minutes after that.

46
0:02:23.59,000 --> 0:02:24,000
CA: OK.

47
0:02:24.836,000 --> 0:02:25,000
JS: But it wasn't bad.

48
0:02:26.011,000 --> 0:02:28,000
CA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook

49
0:02:28.528,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and stepped up your mathematical career.

50
0:02:31.685,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You started working with this man here.

51
0:02:34.161,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Who is this?

52
0:02:36.352,000 --> 0:02:37,000
JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.

53
0:02:37.788,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century.

54
0:02:40.916,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley.

55
0:02:46.173,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I had some ideas,

56
0:02:48.068,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I brought them to him and he liked them.

57
0:02:50.539,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Together, we did this work which you can easily see up there.

58
0:02:57.189,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There it is.

59
0:02:59.198,000 --> 0:03:02,000
CA: It led to you publishing a famous paper together.

60
0:03:02.828,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Can you explain at all what that work was?

61
0:03:07.028,000 --> 0:03:08,000
JS: No.

62
0:03:08.21,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:10.966,000 --> 0:03:12,000
JS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody.

64
0:03:13.054,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:15.153,000 --> 0:03:16,000
CA: How about explaining this?

66
0:03:17.041,000 --> 0:03:19,000
JS: But not many. Not many people.

67
0:03:21.144,000 --> 0:03:23,000
CA: I think you told me it had something to do with spheres,

68
0:03:23.982,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so let's start here.

69
0:03:25.868,000 --> 0:03:28,000
JS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work --

70
0:03:29.492,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it did have something to do with that, but before we get to that --

71
0:03:32.716,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that work was good mathematics.

72
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I was very happy with it; so was Chern.

73
0:03:39.91,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing.

74
0:03:44.638,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics,

75
0:03:49.956,000 --> 0:03:53,000
something we knew nothing about -- at least I knew nothing about physics,

76
0:03:54.275,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot.

77
0:03:56.581,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And about 10 years after the paper came out,

78
0:04:00.568,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory

79
0:04:05.072,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and people in Russia started applying it to what's called "condensed matter."

80
0:04:09.948,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Today, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants

81
0:04:14.865,000 --> 0:04:15,000
have spread through a lot of physics.

82
0:04:16.754,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And it was amazing.

83
0:04:17.952,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We didn't know any physics.

84
0:04:19.714,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics.

85
0:04:22.592,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But that's the thing about mathematics -- you never know where it's going to go.

86
0:04:26.404,000 --> 0:04:27,000
CA: This is so incredible.

87
0:04:27.92,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds

88
0:04:32.308,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that may or may not perceive the truth.

89
0:04:34.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Somehow, you come up with a mathematical theory,

90
0:04:38.177,000 --> 0:04:39,000
not knowing any physics,

91
0:04:40.049,000 --> 0:04:42,000
discover two decades later that it's being applied

92
0:04:42.571,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to profoundly describe the actual physical world.

93
0:04:45.626,000 --> 0:04:46,000
How can that happen?

94
0:04:46.803,000 --> 0:04:47,000
JS: God knows.

95
0:04:47.984,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:50.849,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner,

97
0:04:54.023,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

98
0:04:59.635,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Somehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world

99
0:05:03.611,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in some sense -- we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that --

100
0:05:08.63,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and then it flourishes on its own.

101
0:05:10.976,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But so often it comes back to save the day.

102
0:05:14.293,000 --> 0:05:16,000
General relativity is an example.

103
0:05:16.495,000 --> 0:05:19,000
[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized,

104
0:05:19.636,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity."

105
0:05:23.507,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So, you never know. It is a mystery.

106
0:05:27.056,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It is a mystery.

107
0:05:28.297,000 --> 0:05:31,000
CA: So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity.

108
0:05:31.617,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Tell us about this.

109
0:05:32.983,000 --> 0:05:37,000
JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it --

110
0:05:38.931,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you know, those squares.

111
0:05:42.697,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,

112
0:05:47.627,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the great mathematician, in the 1700s.

113
0:05:50.223,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics:

114
0:05:55.428,000 --> 0:05:57,000
algebraic topology, geometry.

115
0:05:59.039,000 --> 0:06:03,000
That paper up there had its roots in this.

116
0:06:03.427,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So, here's this thing:

117
0:06:05.285,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces.

118
0:06:09.761,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And if you look at the difference -- vertices minus edges plus faces --

119
0:06:13.615,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you get two.

120
0:06:14.791,000 --> 0:06:16,000
OK, well, two. That's a good number.

121
0:06:17.034,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Here's a different way of doing it -- these are triangles covering --

122
0:06:21.306,000 --> 0:06:25,000
this has 12 vertices and 30 edges

123
0:06:25.907,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and 20 faces, 20 tiles.

124
0:06:30.576,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two.

125
0:06:35.191,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And in fact, you could do this any which way --

126
0:06:38.062,000 --> 0:06:41,000
cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles

127
0:06:41.484,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and mix them up.

128
0:06:42.828,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And you take vertices minus edges plus faces -- you'll get two.

129
0:06:46.131,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Here's a different shape.

130
0:06:48.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices

131
0:06:53.754,000 --> 0:06:57,000
covered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces.

132
0:06:58.53,000 --> 0:07:,000
Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.

133
0:07:01.238,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It'll always come out to zero.

134
0:07:02.737,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles

135
0:07:07.071,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or anything like that, you're going to get zero.

136
0:07:12.514,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So, this is called the Euler characteristic.

137
0:07:14.928,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it's what's called a topological invariant.

138
0:07:18.849,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's pretty amazing.

139
0:07:20.029,000 --> 0:07:22,000
No matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer.

140
0:07:22.844,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s,

141
0:07:29.167,000 --> 0:07:32,000
into a subject which is now called algebraic topology.

142
0:07:32.96,000 --> 0:07:34,000
CA: And your own work took an idea like this and moved it

143
0:07:35.967,000 --> 0:07:37,000
into higher-dimensional theory,

144
0:07:38.44,000 --> 0:07:41,000
higher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?

145
0:07:41.552,000 --> 0:07:45,000
JS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants:

146
0:07:46.219,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Pontryagin classes -- actually, there were Chern classes.

147
0:07:50.7,000 --> 0:07:53,000
There were a bunch of these types of invariants.

148
0:07:54.272,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I was struggling to work on one of them

149
0:07:58.431,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and model it sort of combinatorially,

150
0:08:02.658,000 --> 0:08:05,000
instead of the way it was typically done,

151
0:08:05.704,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things.

152
0:08:10.087,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --

153
0:08:13.612,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics

154
0:08:17.617,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and had 13 children,

155
0:08:19.372,000 --> 0:08:25,000
who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing --

156
0:08:25.838,000 --> 0:08:3,000
if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants.

157
0:08:32.157,000 --> 0:08:36,000
CA: OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there.

158
0:08:36.804,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Let's talk about Renaissance.

159
0:08:38.371,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,

160
0:08:44.251,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry.

161
0:08:47.504,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory.

162
0:08:50.218,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades.

163
0:08:56.629,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The way it's been explained to me,

164
0:08:58.324,000 --> 0:09:01,000
what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns,

165
0:09:01.847,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk,

166
0:09:05.754,000 --> 0:09:06,000
compared with other hedge funds.

167
0:09:07.602,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So how on earth did you do this, Jim?

168
0:09:10.071,000 --> 0:09:14,000
JS: I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people.

169
0:09:14.206,000 --> 0:09:17,000
When I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics.

170
0:09:18.186,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I was in my late 30s, I had a little money.

171
0:09:22.133,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I started trading and it went very well.

172
0:09:25.063,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I made quite a lot of money with pure luck.

173
0:09:27.835,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I mean, I think it was pure luck.

174
0:09:29.525,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.

175
0:09:31.658,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But in looking at the data, after a while I realized:

176
0:09:35.513,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it looks like there's some structure here.

177
0:09:38.09,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models --

178
0:09:41.811,000 --> 0:09:45,000
just the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].

179
0:09:46.1,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer.

180
0:09:48.957,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.

181
0:09:51.443,000 --> 0:09:52,000
CA: Can we take a look at this?

182
0:09:52.946,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Because here's a typical graph of some commodity.

183
0:09:58.487,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I look at that, and I say, "That's just a random, up-and-down walk --

184
0:10:02.552,000 --> 0:10:04,000
maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time."

185
0:10:05.438,000 --> 0:10:07,000
How on earth could you trade looking at that,

186
0:10:07.575,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and see something that wasn't just random?

187
0:10:09.925,000 --> 0:10:12,000
JS: In the old days -- this is kind of a graph from the old days,

188
0:10:13.196,000 --> 0:10:17,000
commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend.

189
0:10:17.504,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Not necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods.

190
0:10:23.583,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today,

191
0:10:27.663,000 --> 0:10:31,000
by the average move in the past 20 days --

192
0:10:32.655,000 --> 0:10:35,000
maybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money.

193
0:10:35.786,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And in fact, years ago, such a system would work --

194
0:10:41.418,000 --> 0:10:43,000
not beautifully, but it would work.

195
0:10:43.833,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money.

196
0:10:46.366,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But this is a year's worth of days,

197
0:10:48.588,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and you'd make a little money during that period.

198
0:10:53.884,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's a very vestigial system.

199
0:10:56.525,000 --> 0:10:59,000
CA: So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time

200
0:11:00.078,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and see whether, for example,

201
0:11:02.538,000 --> 0:11:05,000
a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next.

202
0:11:06.043,000 --> 0:11:12,000
JS: Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best.

203
0:11:13.515,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Trend-following would have been great in the '60s,

204
0:11:16.889,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and it was sort of OK in the '70s.

205
0:11:19.045,000 --> 0:11:2,000
By the '80s, it wasn't.

206
0:11:20.942,000 --> 0:11:22,000
CA: Because everyone could see that.

207
0:11:23.783,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?

208
0:11:27.046,000 --> 0:11:33,000
JS: We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches --

209
0:11:33.202,000 --> 0:11:35,000
shorter-term approaches to some extent.

210
0:11:37.107,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data --

211
0:11:40.478,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and we had to get it by hand in the early days.

212
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories

213
0:11:47.57,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers.

214
0:11:50.859,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We got a lot of data.

215
0:11:52.526,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And very smart people -- that was the key.

216
0:11:57.463,000 --> 0:12:,000
I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading.

217
0:12:01.749,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I had hired a few -- some made money, some didn't make money.

218
0:12:04.722,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I couldn't make a business out of that.

219
0:12:06.626,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But I did know how to hire scientists,

220
0:12:08.692,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because I have some taste in that department.

221
0:12:12.105,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So, that's what we did.

222
0:12:13.967,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And gradually these models got better and better,

223
0:12:17.222,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and better and better.

224
0:12:18.581,000 --> 0:12:21,000
CA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance,

225
0:12:21.819,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which is building this culture, this group of people,

226
0:12:24.444,000 --> 0:12:27,000
who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money.

227
0:12:27.61,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science.

228
0:12:31.86,000 --> 0:12:33,000
JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.

229
0:12:34.283,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But some of it was money.

230
0:12:37.887,000 --> 0:12:38,000
CA: They made a lot of money.

231
0:12:39.304,000 --> 0:12:41,000
JS: I can't say that no one came because of the money.

232
0:12:41.865,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I think a lot of them came because of the money.

233
0:12:44.142,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But they also came because it would be fun.

234
0:12:46.187,000 --> 0:12:48,000
CA: What role did machine learning play in all this?

235
0:12:48.699,000 --> 0:12:51,000
JS: In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning.

236
0:12:52.879,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes,

237
0:12:59.194,000 --> 0:13:01,000
until you get better and better at it.

238
0:13:01.4,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things.

239
0:13:05.191,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But it worked.

240
0:13:08.15,000 --> 0:13:12,000
CA: So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected.

241
0:13:12.233,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I mean, you looked at everything, right?

242
0:13:14.171,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion.

243
0:13:17.512,000 --> 0:13:19,000
JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.

244
0:13:20.373,000 --> 0:13:22,000
CA: What sort of things?

245
0:13:22.454,000 --> 0:13:23,000
JS: Well, everything.

246
0:13:23.636,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Everything is grist for the mill -- except hem lengths.

247
0:13:28.852,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Weather, annual reports,

248
0:13:31.176,000 --> 0:13:35,000
quarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it.

249
0:13:35.932,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Whatever there is.

250
0:13:37.107,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We take in terabytes of data a day.

251
0:13:39.752,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis.

252
0:13:45.446,000 --> 0:13:46,000
You're looking for anomalies.

253
0:13:46.852,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You're looking for -- like you said,

254
0:13:49.829,000 --> 0:13:51,000
the efficient market hypothesis is not correct.

255
0:13:52.305,000 --> 0:13:55,000
CA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing.

256
0:13:55.796,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies,

257
0:13:59.478,000 --> 0:14:,000
and see when they align?

258
0:14:01.238,000 --> 0:14:04,000
JS: Any one anomaly might be a random thing;

259
0:14:04.475,000 --> 0:14:07,000
however, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not.

260
0:14:07.538,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time --

261
0:14:12.512,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the probability of it being random is not high.

262
0:14:17.511,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out.

263
0:14:22.393,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So you have to keep on top of the business.

264
0:14:24.837,000 --> 0:14:26,000
CA: A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now

265
0:14:27.533,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and are sort of ... shocked by it,

266
0:14:31.955,000 --> 0:14:33,000
by how much wealth is created there,

267
0:14:34.151,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and how much talent is going into it.

268
0:14:37.523,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Do you have any worries about that industry,

269
0:14:41.553,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and perhaps the financial industry in general?

270
0:14:43.991,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Kind of being on a runaway train that's --

271
0:14:46.719,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I don't know -- helping increase inequality?

272
0:14:50.773,000 --> 0:14:53,000
How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?

273
0:14:54.628,000 --> 0:14:56,000
JS: I think in the last three or four years,

274
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
hedge funds have not done especially well.

275
0:14:59.387,000 --> 0:15:,000
We've done dandy,

276
0:15:00.811,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully.

277
0:15:04.836,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows,

278
0:15:09.762,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and price-earnings ratios have grown.

279
0:15:13.231,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last --

280
0:15:16.318,000 --> 0:15:19,000
let's say, five or six years -- has not been created by hedge funds.

281
0:15:20.458,000 --> 0:15:23,000
People would ask me, "What's a hedge fund?"

282
0:15:23.703,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And I'd say, "One and 20."

283
0:15:25.987,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Which means -- now it's two and 20 --

284
0:15:29.577,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits.

285
0:15:32.954,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures.

286
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
CA: Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that.

287
0:15:39.339,000 --> 0:15:42,000
JS: We charged the highest fees in the world at one time.

288
0:15:42.444,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Five and 44, that's what we charge.

289
0:15:45.694,000 --> 0:15:46,000
CA: Five and 44.

290
0:15:47.116,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So five percent flat, 44 percent of upside.

291
0:15:50.374,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money.

292
0:15:53.181,000 --> 0:15:54,000
JS: We made good returns, yes.

293
0:15:54.657,000 --> 0:15:57,000
People got very mad: "How can you charge such high fees?"

294
0:15:57.681,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I said, "OK, you can withdraw."

295
0:15:59.332,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But "How can I get more?" was what people were --

296
0:16:02.174,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Laughter)

297
0:16:03.702,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But at a certain point, as I think I told you,

298
0:16:06.166,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund.

299
0:16:11.365,000 --> 0:16:13,000
CA: But should we worry about the hedge fund industry

300
0:16:14.093,000 --> 0:16:19,000
attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent

301
0:16:19.555,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?

302
0:16:22.817,000 --> 0:16:23,000
JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.

303
0:16:24.77,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that.

304
0:16:27.833,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I don't think we should worry about it too much.

305
0:16:30.288,000 --> 0:16:33,000
It's still a pretty small industry.

306
0:16:33.454,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And in fact, bringing science into the investing world

307
0:16:39.475,000 --> 0:16:41,000
has improved that world.

308
0:16:41.658,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity.

309
0:16:45.752,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff.

310
0:16:48.965,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund.

311
0:16:54.478,000 --> 0:16:58,000
CA: You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though,

312
0:16:58.666,000 --> 0:17:01,000
at the other end of the supply chain --

313
0:17:02.424,000 --> 0:17:06,000
you're actually boosting mathematics across America.

314
0:17:06.552,000 --> 0:17:07,000
This is your wife, Marilyn.

315
0:17:08.441,000 --> 0:17:12,000
You're working on philanthropic issues together.

316
0:17:13.221,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Tell me about that.

317
0:17:14.408,000 --> 0:17:17,000
JS: Well, Marilyn started --

318
0:17:18.081,000 --> 0:17:21,000
there she is up there, my beautiful wife --

319
0:17:21.552,000 --> 0:17:23,000
she started the foundation about 20 years ago.

320
0:17:24.548,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I think '94.

321
0:17:25.723,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,

322
0:17:27.842,000 --> 0:17:29,000
but it was one of those two years.

323
0:17:30.437,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Laughter)

324
0:17:32.596,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity.

325
0:17:40.346,000 --> 0:17:42,000
She kept the books, and so on.

326
0:17:42.877,000 --> 0:17:48,000
We did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged --

327
0:17:49.615,000 --> 0:17:54,000
which was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research.

328
0:17:55.569,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And that's what we've done.

329
0:17:58.365,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation.

330
0:18:04.744,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So that's what we do.

331
0:18:06.339,000 --> 0:18:08,000
CA: And so Math for America is basically investing

332
0:18:09.272,000 --> 0:18:11,000
in math teachers around the country,

333
0:18:11.934,000 --> 0:18:14,000
giving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching.

334
0:18:15.76,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And really trying to make that more effective

335
0:18:18.835,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire.

336
0:18:21.46,000 --> 0:18:25,000
JS: Yeah -- instead of beating up the bad teachers,

337
0:18:26.274,000 --> 0:18:3,000
which has created morale problems all through the educational community,

338
0:18:31.151,000 --> 0:18:33,000
in particular in math and science,

339
0:18:33.616,000 --> 0:18:39,000
we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status.

340
0:18:39.77,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Yeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year.

341
0:18:42.725,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today,

342
0:18:47.216,000 --> 0:18:48,000
as part of a core.

343
0:18:49.054,000 --> 0:18:52,000
There's a great morale among them.

344
0:18:52.764,000 --> 0:18:54,000
They're staying in the field.

345
0:18:55.294,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Next year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent

346
0:18:58.213,000 --> 0:19:01,000
of the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools.

347
0:19:01.781,000 --> 0:19:06,000
(Applause)

348
0:19:07.71,000 --> 0:19:1,000
CA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically:

349
0:19:11.144,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Research into origins of life, I guess.

350
0:19:13.565,000 --> 0:19:14,000
What are we looking at here?

351
0:19:15.536,000 --> 0:19:16,000
JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.

352
0:19:17.442,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And then I'll tell you what you're looking at.

353
0:19:19.628,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Origins of life is a fascinating question.

354
0:19:22.708,000 --> 0:19:23,000
How did we get here?

355
0:19:25.17,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Well, there are two questions:

356
0:19:26.965,000 --> 0:19:31,000
One is, what is the route from geology to biology --

357
0:19:32.857,000 --> 0:19:33,000
how did we get here?

358
0:19:34.262,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And the other question is, what did we start with?

359
0:19:36.65,000 --> 0:19:39,000
What material, if any, did we have to work with on this route?

360
0:19:39.776,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Those are two very, very interesting questions.

361
0:19:43.773,000 --> 0:19:48,000
The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA

362
0:19:49.631,000 --> 0:19:51,000
or something like that -- how did that all work?

363
0:19:51.913,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And the other, what do we have to work with?

364
0:19:54.325,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Well, more than we think.

365
0:19:56.12,000 --> 0:20:,000
So what's pictured there is a star in formation.

366
0:20:01.836,000 --> 0:20:04,000
Now, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars,

367
0:20:05.285,000 --> 0:20:07,000
about two new stars are created.

368
0:20:07.804,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Don't ask me how, but they're created.

369
0:20:10.298,000 --> 0:20:13,000
And it takes them about a million years to settle out.

370
0:20:14.132,000 --> 0:20:16,000
So, in steady state,

371
0:20:16.332,000 --> 0:20:19,000
there are about two million stars in formation at any time.

372
0:20:20.204,000 --> 0:20:23,000
That one is somewhere along this settling-down period.

373
0:20:24.067,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And there's all this crap sort of circling around it,

374
0:20:27.027,000 --> 0:20:28,000
dust and stuff.

375
0:20:29.479,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms.

376
0:20:32.526,000 --> 0:20:34,000
But here's the thing --

377
0:20:34.726,000 --> 0:20:4,000
in this dust that surrounds a forming star

378
0:20:41.098,000 --> 0:20:47,000
have been found, now, significant organic molecules.

379
0:20:47.958,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Molecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide --

380
0:20:54.121,000 --> 0:21:,000
things that are the building blocks -- the seeds, if you will -- of life.

381
0:21:01.136,000 --> 0:21:03,000
So, that may be typical.

382
0:21:04.395,000 --> 0:21:1,000
And it may be typical that planets around the universe

383
0:21:11.353,000 --> 0:21:14,000
start off with some of these basic building blocks.

384
0:21:15.83,000 --> 0:21:17,000
Now does that mean there's going to be life all around?

385
0:21:18.569,000 --> 0:21:19,000
Maybe.

386
0:21:19.957,000 --> 0:21:23,000
But it's a question of how tortuous this path is

387
0:21:24.108,000 --> 0:21:28,000
from those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life.

388
0:21:28.526,000 --> 0:21:33,000
And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets.

389
0:21:33.742,000 --> 0:21:34,000
CA: So for you, personally,

390
0:21:35.175,000 --> 0:21:37,000
finding an answer to this question of where we came from,

391
0:21:37.921,000 --> 0:21:4,000
of how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see.

392
0:21:41.603,000 --> 0:21:42,000
JS: Would love to see.

393
0:21:43.413,000 --> 0:21:44,000
And like to know --

394
0:21:44.927,000 --> 0:21:49,000
if that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable,

395
0:21:50.121,000 --> 0:21:54,000
that no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity.

396
0:21:55.336,000 --> 0:21:56,000
But on the other hand,

397
0:21:56.512,000 --> 0:21:59,000
given all this organic dust that's floating around,

398
0:22:00.014,000 --> 0:22:03,000
we could have lots of friends out there.

399
0:22:04.947,000 --> 0:22:05,000
It'd be great to know.

400
0:22:06.132,000 --> 0:22:09,000
CA: Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,

401
0:22:09.636,000 --> 0:22:11,000
and I asked him the secret of his success,

402
0:22:12.497,000 --> 0:22:15,000
and he said taking physics seriously was it.

403
0:22:16.696,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Listening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously,

404
0:22:20.723,000 --> 0:22:23,000
that has infused your whole life.

405
0:22:24.123,000 --> 0:22:28,000
It's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest

406
0:22:28.71,000 --> 0:22:32,000
in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere.

407
0:22:33.567,000 --> 0:22:35,000
Could it be that science actually works?

408
0:22:36.449,000 --> 0:22:38,000
That math actually works?

409
0:22:39.245,000 --> 0:22:43,000
JS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works.

410
0:22:43.641,000 --> 0:22:44,000
But this has been fun.

411
0:22:44.863,000 --> 0:22:48,000
Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable.

412
0:22:49.833,000 --> 0:22:51,000
CA: I just find it -- it's an inspirational thought to me,

413
0:22:52.793,000 --> 0:22:56,000
that by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.

414
0:22:56.824,000 --> 0:22:59,000
So thank you for your amazing life, and for coming here to TED.

415
0:22:59.866,000 --> 0:22:59,000
Thank you.

416
0:23:00.651,000 --> 0:23:01,000
Jim Simons!

417
0:23:01.806,000 --> 0:23:05,000

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Like every passionate software engineer out there,

2
0:00:16.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I closely follow technology companies in Silicon Valley,

3
0:00:19.6,000 --> 0:00:22,000
pretty much the same way soccer fans follow their teams in Europe.

4
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I read articles on tech blogs

5
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and listen to podcasts on my phone.

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But after I finish the article,

7
0:00:30.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
lock my phone and unplug the headphones,

8
0:00:34.28,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm back in sub-Saharan Africa,

9
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:38,000
where the landscape is not quite the same.

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We have long and frequent power outages,

11
0:00:43.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
low penetration of computers,

12
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:46,000
slow internet connections

13
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and a lot of patients visiting understaffed hospitals.

14
0:00:52.04,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Since the HIV epidemic,

15
0:00:54.2,000 --> 0:00:59,000
hospitals have been struggling to manage regular HIV treatment records

16
0:00:59.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
for increasing volumes of patients.

17
0:01:02.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
For such environments,

18
0:01:04.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
importing technology systems developed elsewhere has not worked,

19
0:01:08.4,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but in 2006, I joined Baobab Health,

20
0:01:11.64,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a team that uses locally based engineers

21
0:01:15.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to develop suitable interventions

22
0:01:17.84,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that are addressing health care challenges in Malawi.

23
0:01:21.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We designed an electronic health record system

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that is used by health care workers while seeing patients.

25
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And in the process we realized that we not only had to design the software,

26
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:35,000
we had to implement the infrastructure as well.

27
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We don't have enough medical staff

28
0:01:38.88,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to comprehensively examine every patient,

29
0:01:41.76,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so we embedded clinical guidelines within the software

30
0:01:44.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to guide nurses and clerks

31
0:01:47.04,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who assist with handling some of the workload.

32
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Everyone has a birthday,

33
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but not everyone knows their birthday,

34
0:01:54.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so we wrote algorithms to handle estimated birthdates

35
0:01:58.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as complete dates.

36
0:02:00.2,000 --> 0:02:03,000
How do we follow up patients living in slums

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with no street and house numbers?

38
0:02:07.2,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We used landmarks to approximate their physical addresses.

39
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Malawi had no IDs to uniquely identify patients,

40
0:02:16.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so we had to implement unique patient IDs

41
0:02:19.64,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to link patient records across clinics.

42
0:02:22.919,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The IDs are printed as barcodes

43
0:02:26.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
on labels that are stuck on personal health booklets

44
0:02:29.08,000 --> 0:02:3,000
kept by each patient.

45
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:32,000
With this barcoded ID,

46
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
a simple scan with a barcode reader

47
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
quickly pulls up the patient's records.

48
0:02:38.44,000 --> 0:02:4,000
No need to rewrite their personal details

49
0:02:40.76,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on paper registers at every visit.

50
0:02:43.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And suddenly, queues became shorter.

51
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This meant patients, typically mothers with little children on their backs,

52
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
had to spend less time waiting to be assisted.

53
0:02:53.96,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And if they lose their booklets,

54
0:02:55.92,000 --> 0:02:58,000
their records can still be pulled by searching with their names.

55
0:02:59.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, the way we pronounce and spell names varies tremendously.

56
0:03:04.36,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We freely mix R's and L's,

57
0:03:07.08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
English and vernacular versions of their names.

58
0:03:10.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Even soundex,

59
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a standard method for grouping words by how similar they sound,

60
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was not good enough.

61
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So we had to modify it

62
0:03:19.88,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to help us link and match existing records.

63
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Before the iPhone,

64
0:03:28.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
software engineers developed for personal computers,

65
0:03:31.88,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but from our experience,

66
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we knew our power system is not reliable enough

67
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for personal computers.

68
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So we repurposed touch screen point-of-sale terminals

69
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that are meant for retail shops

70
0:03:44.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to become clinical workstations.

71
0:03:47.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
At the time, we imported internet appliances called i-Openers

72
0:03:52.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that were manufactured during the dot-com era

73
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
by a failed US company.

74
0:03:59.08,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We modified their screens

75
0:04:01.4,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to add touch sensors

76
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and their power system to run from rechargeable batteries.

77
0:04:06.68,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When we started, we didn't find a reliable network to transmit data,

78
0:04:11.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
especially from rural hospitals.

79
0:04:14.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So we built our own towers,

80
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:18,000
created a wireless network

81
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and linked clinics in Lilongwe,

82
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Malawi's capital.

83
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:29.6,000 --> 0:04:3,000
With a team of engineers

85
0:04:32.2,000 --> 0:04:34,000
working within a hospital campus,

86
0:04:34.52,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we observed health care workers use the system

87
0:04:37.2,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and iteratively build an information system

88
0:04:40.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that is now managing HIV records

89
0:04:44.28,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in all major public hospitals in Malawi.

90
0:04:47.92,000 --> 0:04:52,000
These are hospitals serving over 2,000 HIV patients, each clinic.

91
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, health care workers who used to spend days

92
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to tally and prepare quarterly reports

93
0:04:59.72,000 --> 0:05:01,000
are producing the same reports within minutes,

94
0:05:02.96,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and health care experts from all over the world

95
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:09,000
are now coming to Malawi to learn how we did it.

96
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

97
0:05:14.36,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It is inspiring and fun

98
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to follow technology trends across the globe,

99
0:05:19.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but to make them work

100
0:05:21.92,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in low-resourced environments

101
0:05:24.12,000 --> 0:05:27,000
like public hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa,

102
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we have had to become jacks-of-all-trades

103
0:05:31.12,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and build whole systems, including the infrastructure,

104
0:05:34.68,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from the ground up.

105
0:05:36.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Thank you.

106
0:05:37.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

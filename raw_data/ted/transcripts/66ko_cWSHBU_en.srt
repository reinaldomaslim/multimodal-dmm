1
0:00:12.954,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots.

2
0:00:16.927,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So what are these dots?

3
0:00:18.101,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, it's all of us.

4
0:00:19.412,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And we're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and travel

5
0:00:24.521,000 --> 0:00:26,000
throughout our cities and around the world.

6
0:00:26.958,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement?

7
0:00:30.918,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it.

8
0:00:34.259,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And luckily for us, we live in a time

9
0:00:36.068,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves.

10
0:00:40.807,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So whether it's through sensors or videos, or apps,

11
0:00:44.494,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail.

12
0:00:48.092,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement

13
0:00:53.148,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is sports.

14
0:00:54.682,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So whether it's basketball or baseball, or football or the other football,

15
0:01:00.039,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements

16
0:01:04.465,000 --> 0:01:05,000
every fraction of a second.

17
0:01:05.802,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So what we're doing is turning our athletes into --

18
0:01:10.208,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you probably guessed it --

19
0:01:12.191,000 --> 0:01:13,000
moving dots.

20
0:01:13.946,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data,

21
0:01:18.904,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it's hard to deal with and not that interesting.

22
0:01:21.43,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know.

23
0:01:25.223,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second

24
0:01:29.057,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of every game, remember it and process it.

25
0:01:31.804,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And a person can't do that,

26
0:01:33.758,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but a machine can.

27
0:01:35.661,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach.

28
0:01:39.363,000 --> 0:01:41,000
At least they couldn't until now.

29
0:01:42.228,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So what have we taught the machine to see?

30
0:01:45.569,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So, we started simply.

31
0:01:47.38,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We taught it things like passes, shots and rebounds.

32
0:01:51.203,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Things that most casual fans would know.

33
0:01:53.768,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated.

34
0:01:56.624,000 --> 0:02:,000
Events like post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.

35
0:02:01.377,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And if you don't know them, that's okay. Most casual players probably do.

36
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, we've gotten to a point where today, the machine understands complex events

37
0:02:10.924,000 --> 0:02:13,000
like down screens and wide pins.

38
0:02:14.021,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Basically things only professionals know.

39
0:02:16.771,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach.

40
0:02:22.009,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So how have we been able to do this?

41
0:02:24.511,000 --> 0:02:27,000
If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick-and-roll,

42
0:02:27.653,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they would give me a description,

43
0:02:29.317,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and if I encoded that as an algorithm, it would be terrible.

44
0:02:33.026,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players,

45
0:02:37.328,000 --> 0:02:38,000
two on offense and two on defense.

46
0:02:39.486,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And here's kind of how it goes.

47
0:02:41.128,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So there's the guy on offense without the ball

48
0:02:43.685,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball,

49
0:02:46.918,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and he kind of stays there

50
0:02:48.199,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and they both move and stuff happens, and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.

51
0:02:51.54,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:53.779,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm.

53
0:02:56.913,000 --> 0:03:,000
So, if the player who's the interferer -- he's called the screener --

54
0:03:01.278,000 --> 0:03:03,000
goes close by, but he doesn't stop,

55
0:03:04.174,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

56
0:03:06.56,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Or if he does stop, but he doesn't stop close enough,

57
0:03:10.529,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

58
0:03:12.642,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Or, if he does go close by and he does stop

59
0:03:15.903,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but they do it under the basket, it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

60
0:03:19.462,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Or I could be wrong, they could all be pick-and-rolls.

61
0:03:22.01,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It really depends on the exact timing, the distances, the locations,

62
0:03:26.602,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and that's what makes it hard.

63
0:03:28.579,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So, luckily, with machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability

64
0:03:33.547,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to describe the things we know.

65
0:03:35.314,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So how does this work? Well, it's by example.

66
0:03:37.759,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So we go to the machine and say, "Good morning, machine.

67
0:03:41.077,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Here are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not.

68
0:03:44.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Please find a way to tell the difference."

69
0:03:47.076,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate.

70
0:03:50.807,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So if I was going to teach it the difference

71
0:03:52.94,000 --> 0:03:53,000
between an apple and orange,

72
0:03:54.345,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I might say, "Why don't you use color or shape?"

73
0:03:56.744,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the problem that we're solving is, what are those things?

74
0:03:59.711,000 --> 0:04:,000
What are the key features

75
0:04:00.982,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots?

76
0:04:04.505,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location,

77
0:04:09.352,000 --> 0:04:1,000
distance, timing, velocities --

78
0:04:11.44,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it,

79
0:04:16.392,000 --> 0:04:19,000
spatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular.

80
0:04:19.925,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Because the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard --

81
0:04:22.847,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because it is.

82
0:04:24.41,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know

83
0:04:27.575,000 --> 0:04:28,000
whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.

84
0:04:29.521,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's that they want to know how it happened.

85
0:04:31.621,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And why is it so important to them? So here's a little insight.

86
0:04:34.631,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It turns out in modern basketball,

87
0:04:36.426,000 --> 0:04:38,000
this pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play.

88
0:04:39.065,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it,

89
0:04:41.709,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is basically a key to winning and losing most games.

90
0:04:44.403,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations

91
0:04:48.228,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters,

92
0:04:51.9,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and that's why we need this to be really, really good.

93
0:04:55.228,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, here's an example.

94
0:04:56.428,000 --> 0:04:58,000
There are two offensive and two defensive players,

95
0:04:58.831,000 --> 0:05:,000
getting ready to do the pick-and-roll dance.

96
0:05:01.007,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So the guy with ball can either take, or he can reject.

97
0:05:04.086,000 --> 0:05:07,000
His teammate can either roll or pop.

98
0:05:07.111,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under.

99
0:05:10.121,000 --> 0:05:14,000
His teammate can either show or play up to touch, or play soft

100
0:05:14.71,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and together they can either switch or blitz

101
0:05:17.352,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I didn't know most of these things when I started

102
0:05:20.035,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows.

103
0:05:23.979,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It would make our lives a lot easier, but it turns out movement is very messy.

104
0:05:28.047,000 --> 0:05:33,000
People wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified

105
0:05:33.555,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with very high accuracy,

106
0:05:34.882,000 --> 0:05:35,000
both in precision and recall, is tough

107
0:05:36.774,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you.

108
0:05:40.416,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features

109
0:05:43.82,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we have been able to do that.

110
0:05:45.318,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations.

111
0:05:49.478,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We're at the point where almost every single contender

112
0:05:53.035,000 --> 0:05:54,000
for an NBA championship this year

113
0:05:54.682,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is using our software, which is built on a machine that understands

114
0:05:59.114,000 --> 0:06:,000
the moving dots of basketball.

115
0:06:01.872,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So not only that, we have given advice that has changed strategies

116
0:06:07.049,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that have helped teams win very important games,

117
0:06:10.425,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league

118
0:06:14.181,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for 30 years that are willing to take advice from a machine.

119
0:06:17.874,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And it's very exciting, it's much more than the pick-and-roll.

120
0:06:20.804,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Our computer started out with simple things

121
0:06:22.904,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and learned more and more complex things

122
0:06:24.992,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and now it knows so many things.

123
0:06:26.577,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Frankly, I don't understand much of what it does,

124
0:06:29.436,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and while it's not that special to be smarter than me,

125
0:06:33.175,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we were wondering, can a machine know more than a coach?

126
0:06:36.843,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Can it know more than person could know?

127
0:06:38.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And it turns out the answer is yes.

128
0:06:40.691,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The coaches want players to take good shots.

129
0:06:43.272,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So if I'm standing near the basket

130
0:06:44.947,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and there's nobody near me, it's a good shot.

131
0:06:47.137,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.

132
0:06:51.101,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But we never knew how good "good" was, or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.

133
0:06:56.209,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Until now.

134
0:06:57.771,000 --> 0:07:,000
So what we can do, again, using spatiotemporal features,

135
0:07:00.853,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we looked at every shot.

136
0:07:02.251,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We can see: Where is the shot? What's the angle to the basket?

137
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Where are the defenders standing? What are their distances?

138
0:07:08.066,000 --> 0:07:09,000
What are their angles?

139
0:07:09.421,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For multiple defenders, we can look at how the player's moving

140
0:07:12.422,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and predict the shot type.

141
0:07:13.879,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts

142
0:07:17.977,000 --> 0:07:21,000
what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances?

143
0:07:22.188,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So why is this important?

144
0:07:24.102,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We can take something that was shooting,

145
0:07:26.929,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which was one thing before, and turn it into two things:

146
0:07:29.633,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter.

147
0:07:33.68,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So here's a bubble chart, because what's TED without a bubble chart?

148
0:07:36.966,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:38.004,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Those are NBA players.

150
0:07:39.339,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The size is the size of the player and the color is the position.

151
0:07:42.483,000 --> 0:07:44,000
On the x-axis, we have the shot probability.

152
0:07:44.639,000 --> 0:07:45,000
People on the left take difficult shots,

153
0:07:46.616,000 --> 0:07:48,000
on the right, they take easy shots.

154
0:07:49.194,000 --> 0:07:51,000
On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.

155
0:07:51.275,000 --> 0:07:53,000
People who are good are at the top, bad at the bottom.

156
0:07:53.861,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So for example, if there was a player

157
0:07:55.621,000 --> 0:07:57,000
who generally made 47 percent of their shots,

158
0:07:57.718,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that's all you knew before.

159
0:07:59.345,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But today, I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player

160
0:08:04.219,000 --> 0:08:05,000
would make 49 percent of the time,

161
0:08:06.204,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and they are two percent worse.

162
0:08:08.266,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And the reason that's important is that there are lots of 47s out there.

163
0:08:13.714,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And so it's really important to know

164
0:08:16.287,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if the 47 that you're considering giving 100 million dollars to

165
0:08:20.267,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is a good shooter who takes bad shots

166
0:08:23.346,000 --> 0:08:25,000
or a bad shooter who takes good shots.

167
0:08:27.13,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players,

168
0:08:30.487,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it changes how we look at the game.

169
0:08:32.369,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.

170
0:08:36.148,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Miami was down by three, there was 20 seconds left.

171
0:08:39.379,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They were about to lose the championship.

172
0:08:41.428,000 --> 0:08:44,000
A gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie.

173
0:08:44.793,000 --> 0:08:45,000
He missed.

174
0:08:46.015,000 --> 0:08:47,000
His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,

175
0:08:47.876,000 --> 0:08:49,000
passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen.

176
0:08:50.059,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He sank a three. It went into overtime.

177
0:08:52.002,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They won the game. They won the championship.

178
0:08:54.122,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It was one of the most exciting games in basketball.

179
0:08:57.438,000 --> 0:09:,000
And our ability to know the shot probability for every player

180
0:09:00.891,000 --> 0:09:01,000
at every second,

181
0:09:02.103,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second

182
0:09:05.083,000 --> 0:09:08,000
can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before.

183
0:09:09.618,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now unfortunately, I can't show you that video.

184
0:09:12.31,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But for you, we recreated that moment

185
0:09:16.827,000 --> 0:09:18,000
at our weekly basketball game about 3 weeks ago.

186
0:09:19.279,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:21.573,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights.

188
0:09:25.199,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So, here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,

189
0:09:29.478,000 --> 0:09:3,000
a park we play at every week,

190
0:09:31.066,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment

191
0:09:33.321,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and all the tracking that's associated with it.

192
0:09:36.772,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, here's the shot.

193
0:09:38.313,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I'm going to show you that moment

194
0:09:40.853,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and all the insights of that moment.

195
0:09:43.464,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The only difference is, instead of the professional players, it's us,

196
0:09:47.218,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and instead of a professional announcer, it's me.

197
0:09:49.86,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So, bear with me.

198
0:09:53.153,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Miami.

199
0:09:54.671,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Down three.

200
0:09:56.107,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Twenty seconds left.

201
0:09:59.385,000 --> 0:10:,000
Jeff brings up the ball.

202
0:10:02.656,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Josh catches, puts up a three!

203
0:10:04.631,000 --> 0:10:05,000

211
0:10:22.676,000 --> 0:10:23,000

212
0:10:24.32,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Tie game with five seconds left.

213
0:10:26.88,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The crowd goes wild.

214
0:10:28.522,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:30.205,000 --> 0:10:31,000
That's roughly how it happened.

216
0:10:31.776,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

217
0:10:32.951,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Roughly.

218
0:10:34.15,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

219
0:10:36.121,000 --> 0:10:41,000
That moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA

220
0:10:41.629,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and we know that and a great many other things.

221
0:10:43.914,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen.

222
0:10:47.429,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:49.2,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Okay, I will! It was four.

224
0:10:51.096,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:52.121,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Way to go, Daria.

226
0:10:53.647,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But the important thing about that video

227
0:10:57.934,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game -- it's not that.

228
0:11:02.639,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement.

229
0:11:07.083,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement.

230
0:11:10.764,000 --> 0:11:13,000
In fact, it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere.

231
0:11:15.654,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We're moving in our homes,

232
0:11:21.428,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in our offices,

233
0:11:24.238,000 --> 0:11:26,000
as we shop and we travel

234
0:11:29.318,000 --> 0:11:3,000
throughout our cities

235
0:11:32.065,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and around our world.

236
0:11:35.27,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What will we know? What will we learn?

237
0:11:37.589,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Perhaps, instead of identifying pick-and-rolls,

238
0:11:39.918,000 --> 0:11:42,000
a machine can identify the moment and let me know

239
0:11:42.952,000 --> 0:11:44,000
when my daughter takes her first steps.

240
0:11:45.035,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Which could literally be happening any second now.

241
0:11:48.14,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings, better plan our cities.

242
0:11:52.362,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots,

243
0:11:56.559,000 --> 0:11:59,000
we will move better, we will move smarter, we will move forward.

244
0:12:00.607,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Thank you very much.

245
0:12:01.82,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

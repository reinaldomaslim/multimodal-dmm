1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and it's made with a new technique

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I've been playing around with,

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we call the epoxy method.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I call it an epoxy method because --

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it's not very appetizing. I understand that --

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but -- but

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's two resins that are, sort of,

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but when you put the two together,

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
something happens. A bond takes place,

14
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and you get this very strong, powerful

15
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
adhesive.

16
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, in this technique,

17
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
what I've tried to do is kind of

18
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,

19
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the artisan bread-baking community,

20
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so --

21
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America --

22
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and put it together to come up with a method

23
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that would help to take whole-grain breads.

24
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.

25
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We finally, after 40 years of knowing

26
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that wholegrain was a healthier option,

27
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over

28
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and attempting to actually eat them.

29
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,

31
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you know, how do you make it taste good?

32
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour

33
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.

34
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --

35
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.

36
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So a baker, and a good baker,

37
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
knows how to pull or draw forth

38
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.

39
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.

40
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,

41
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,

42
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for the bran is fiber.

43
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's got germ. Those are the good things,

44
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.

45
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So whole grain breads historically

46
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,

47
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and people don't like to eat,

48
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,

49
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but when we think of something as a health food,

50
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,

51
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
not out of passion and love for the flavor.

52
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker,

53
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,

54
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is to deliver flavor.

55
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.

56
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.

57
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And -- and

58
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,

59
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?

60
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So, this is the challenge for this bread.

61
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We're going to try this at lunch, and

62
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'll explain a bit more about it,

63
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --

64
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor

65
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is to make a piece of dough

66
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the day before that is not leavened.

67
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's just dough that is wet.

68
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --

69
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that helps to start enzyme activity.

70
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough

71
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that brings out flavor.

72
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.

73
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That's what enzymes are doing.

74
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And so, if we can release some of those,

75
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they become accessible to us in our palate.

76
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They become accessible to the yeast as food.

77
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization

78
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to give us a beautiful crust.

79
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The other pre-dough

80
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.

81
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"

82
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,

83
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and that starts to develop flavor also.

84
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.

85
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And we're hoping that, sort of, the

86
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
enzyme piece of dough

87
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,

88
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,

89
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we can create a bread that does evoke

90
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.

91
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --

92
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.

93
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.

94
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.

95
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this is what every student has to begin with.

96
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that

97
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"

98
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."

99
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Everything in its place. First stage.

100
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.

101
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.

102
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We have to develop the gluten.

103
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.

104
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy

105
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
because we've got glutenin and gliadin,

106
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.

107
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,

108
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.

109
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so we, in the mixing process,

110
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
have to develop the gluten,

111
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,

112
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.

113
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage,

114
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which is really where the flavor develops.

115
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,

116
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --

117
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.

118
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's yeast burps and sweat.

119
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And somehow, this is transformed --

120
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --

121
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special

122
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is that it is a transformational food,

123
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we're going to explore that in a minute.

124
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But then, quickly through the next few stages.

125
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We, after it's fermented and it's developed,

126
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
started to develop flavor and character,

127
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we divide it into smaller units.

128
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,

129
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.

130
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's called "rounding."

131
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.

132
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.

133
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Then we go into final shaping,

134
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.

135
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.

136
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.

137
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And then, stage nine.

138
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing

139
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.

140
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.

141
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We call it "proofing."

142
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.

143
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,

144
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.

145
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Three transformations take place in the oven.

146
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.

147
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They give us that beautiful brown crust.

148
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.

149
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Inside, the proteins --

150
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
this gluten -- coagulates.

151
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When it gets to about 160 degrees,

152
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the proteins all line up and they create structure,

153
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the gluten structure --

154
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.

155
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,

156
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
gelatinize.

157
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And gelatinization is yet another

158
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
oven transformation.

159
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --

160
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,

161
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.

162
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.

163
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --

164
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
sweat, burps and starch guts.

165
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven

166
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because what went into the oven as dough

167
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
comes out in stage 11 as bread.

168
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And stage 11, we call it cooling --

169
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because we never really eat the bread right away.

170
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
There's a little carry-over baking.

171
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.

172
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"

173
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but my students call "eating."

174
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,

175
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and in a few minutes we will try this,

176
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and see if we have succeeded

177
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.

178
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps,

179
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,

180
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because I really believe that

181
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
all things can be understood --

182
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --

183
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that all things can be understood on four levels:

184
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,

185
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the political or ethical level.

186
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.

187
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.

188
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels

189
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
unless you first understand the literal level,

190
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so that's why we're talking literally about bread.

191
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But let's kind of look at these stages again

192
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --

193
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
all in my quest for answering the question,

194
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"What is it about bread that's so special?"

195
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.

196
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Because what happens is,

197
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
bread begins as wheat or any other grain.

198
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass

199
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that grows in the field.

200
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.

201
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.

202
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?

203
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?

204
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?

205
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.

206
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We harvest the wheat,

207
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and in harvesting it, we kill it.

208
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, wheat is alive,

209
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.

210
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.

211
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We can plant those in the ground.

212
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we save some of those for the next generation.

213
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But most of those seeds get crushed

214
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and turned into flour.

215
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.

216
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's not only been killed,

217
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.

218
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So we turn it into flour.

219
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.

220
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The first transformation -- and, by the way,

221
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the definition of transformation for me is

222
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a radical change from one thing into something else.

223
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.

224
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Not like hot water made cold,

225
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or cold water turned hot,

226
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but water boiled off and becoming steam.

227
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
That's a transformation, two different things.

228
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Well, in this case, the first transformation

229
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is alive to dead.

230
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'd call that radical.

231
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So, we've got now this flour.

232
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And what do we do? We add some water.

233
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In stage one, we weigh it.

234
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,

235
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and we create something that we call "clay."

236
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's like clay.

237
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And we infuse that clay

238
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
with an ingredient that we call "leaven."

239
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?

240
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven --

241
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to vivify, to bring to life.

242
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.

243
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You see, the baker, in this moment,

244
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
has become, in a sense,

245
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,

246
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.

247
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And we know it's alive because in stage three,

248
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it grows. Growth is the proof of life.

249
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And while it's growing, all these

250
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
literal transformations are taking place.

251
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.

252
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Yeast is eating sugar and

253
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.

254
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,

255
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
turning them into acids.

256
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough

257
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
under the watchful gaze of the baker.

258
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And the baker's choices all along the way

259
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
determine the outcome of the product.

260
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --

261
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature

262
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and ingredients. That's the art of baking.

263
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So all these things are determined by the baker,

264
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.

265
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough

266
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is divided into smaller units, and each of those units

267
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are given shape by the baker.

268
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And as they're shaped, they're raised again,

269
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
all along proving that they're alive,

270
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and developing character.

271
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.

272
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --

273
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
a few people do, I think, but not too many.

274
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I've met some dough eaters, but --

275
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.

276
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But dough is what we're working with,

277
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we take that dough to the oven,

278
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough

279
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
crosses the threshold of 140 degrees,

280
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it passes what we call the "thermal death point."

281
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.

282
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.

283
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,

284
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to enliven it, to vivify it,

285
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in order to complete its mission,

286
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which is also to turn this dough into bread,

287
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
has to give up its life.

288
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.

289
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It's starting to make sense to me --

290
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
what goes in is dough,

291
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
what comes out is bread --

292
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or it goes in alive,

293
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
comes out dead.

294
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.

295
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.

296
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Third transformation, alive to dead --

297
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but dough to bread.

298
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Or another analogy would be,

299
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.

300
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And it's what comes out of the oven

301
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that is what we call the staff of life.

302
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
This is the product

303
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that

304
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.

305
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It's so

306
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
deeply embedded in our psyches that

307
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
bread is used as a symbol for life.

308
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's used as a symbol for transformation.

309
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,

310
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
again completing the life cycle,

311
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --

312
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on

313
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and have opportunities to ponder

314
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
things like this.

315
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So this is what I've learned from bread.

316
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.

317
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And what we're going to attempt to do

318
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with this bread here, again,

319
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is to use, in addition to everything we talked about,

320
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"

321
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.

322
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Beer is basically liquid bread,

323
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or bread is solid beer.

324
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And --

325
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

326
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.

327
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep

328
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.

329
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But we've got this bread,

330
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and what I did here is to try to, again,

331
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
evoke even more flavor from this grain,

332
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.

333
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.

334
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain

335
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort --

336
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.

337
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains

338
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
by using sprouting and malting and roasting.

339
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.

340
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread,

341
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
but now fiber on top of fiber.

342
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And so this is, again, hopefully

343
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
not only a healthy bread,

344
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but a bread that you will enjoy.

345
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So, if I, kind of, break this bread,

346
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
maybe we can share this now a little bit here.

347
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We'll start a little piece here,

348
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and I'm going to take a little piece here --

349
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.

350
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I'll leave you

351
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
with what I call the baker's blessing.

352
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
May your crust be crisp,

353
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and your bread always rise.

354
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Thank you.

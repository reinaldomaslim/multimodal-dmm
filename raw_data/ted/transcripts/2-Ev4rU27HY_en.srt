1
0:00:12.285,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is an image of the planet Earth.

2
0:00:15.178,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures

3
0:00:18.271,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that are very well known.

4
0:00:19.882,000 --> 0:00:21,000
There is something different;

5
0:00:21.952,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you can click on it,

6
0:00:23.399,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and if you click on it,

7
0:00:24.597,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.

8
0:00:27.669,000 --> 0:00:28,000
For instance, this is a bird's-eye view

9
0:00:29.668,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of the EPFL campus.

10
0:00:32.334,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In many cases, you can also see

11
0:00:34.442,000 --> 0:00:37,000
how a building looks from a nearby street.

12
0:00:38.182,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is pretty amazing.

13
0:00:39.604,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:

14
0:00:43.031,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's time.

15
0:00:45.219,000 --> 0:00:48,000
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.

16
0:00:48.289,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'm not even sure it was taken

17
0:00:49.701,000 --> 0:00:55,000
at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.

18
0:00:55.784,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In my lab, we develop tools

19
0:00:57.993,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to travel not only in space

20
0:00:59.757,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but also through time.

21
0:01:02.315,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The kind of question we're asking is

22
0:01:04.185,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Is it possible to build something

23
0:01:05.578,000 --> 0:01:07,000
like Google Maps of the past?

24
0:01:07.756,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps

25
0:01:11.066,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and just change the year,

26
0:01:12.869,000 --> 0:01:13,000
seeing how it was 100 years before,

27
0:01:14.66,000 --> 0:01:15,000
1,000 years before?

28
0:01:16.329,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Is that possible?

29
0:01:18.452,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past?

30
0:01:20.704,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?

31
0:01:23.753,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So, can I build time machines?

32
0:01:27.529,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible."

33
0:01:30.094,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.

34
0:01:33.904,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is what I call the information mushroom.

35
0:01:37.094,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Vertically, you have the time.

36
0:01:38.677,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and horizontally, the amount of digital information available.

37
0:01:41.417,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.

38
0:01:44.899,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.

39
0:01:48.447,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,

40
0:01:50.765,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or Facebook of the past,

41
0:01:52.259,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we need to enlarge this space,

42
0:01:53.833,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we need to make that like a rectangle.

43
0:01:55.771,000 --> 0:01:56,000
How do we do that?

44
0:01:57.281,000 --> 0:01:59,000
One way is digitization.

45
0:01:59.395,000 --> 0:02:,000
There's a lot of material available --

46
0:02:01.19,000 --> 0:02:07,000
newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.

47
0:02:07.46,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I can digitize all these.

48
0:02:09.228,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I can extract information from these.

49
0:02:11.965,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Of course, the more you go in the past, the less information you will have.

50
0:02:15.508,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So, it might not be enough.

51
0:02:18.154,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, I can do what historians do.

52
0:02:20.562,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I can extrapolate.

53
0:02:22.086,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.

54
0:02:26.556,000 --> 0:02:27,000
If I take a log book,

55
0:02:28.307,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I can consider, it's not just a log book

56
0:02:30.711,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.

57
0:02:33.683,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I can consider it is actually a log book

58
0:02:35.326,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which is representative of many journeys of that period.

59
0:02:37.908,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'm extrapolating.

60
0:02:40.153,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If I have a painting of a facade,

61
0:02:42.191,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I can consider it's not just that particular building,

62
0:02:44.942,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but probably it also shares the same grammar

63
0:02:48.874,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of buildings where we lost any information.

64
0:02:52.915,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So if we want to construct a time machine,

65
0:02:55.773,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we need two things.

66
0:02:57.112,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We need very large archives,

67
0:02:59.346,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and we need excellent specialists.

68
0:03:02.088,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The Venice Time Machine,

69
0:03:03.962,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the project I'm going to talk to you about,

70
0:03:05.767,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is a joint project between the EPFL

71
0:03:08.787,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.

72
0:03:11.765,000 --> 0:03:13,000
There's something very peculiar about Venice,

73
0:03:13.93,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that its administration has been

74
0:03:16.604,000 --> 0:03:18,000
very, very bureaucratic.

75
0:03:18.798,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They've been keeping track of everything,

76
0:03:20.991,000 --> 0:03:22,000
almost like Google today.

77
0:03:23.906,000 --> 0:03:24,000
At the Archivio di Stato,

78
0:03:25.42,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you have 80 kilometers of archives

79
0:03:27.184,000 --> 0:03:29,000
documenting every aspect

80
0:03:29.193,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the life of Venice over more than 1,000 years.

81
0:03:31.439,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You have every boat that goes out,

82
0:03:33.359,000 --> 0:03:34,000
every boat that comes in.

83
0:03:34.435,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You have every change that was made in the city.

84
0:03:37.232,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is all there.

85
0:03:40.523,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We are setting up a 10-year digitization program

86
0:03:44.431,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which has the objective of transforming

87
0:03:46.108,000 --> 0:03:47,000
this immense archive

88
0:03:47.492,000 --> 0:03:49,000
into a giant information system.

89
0:03:49.918,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The type of objective we want to reach

90
0:03:51.775,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is 450 books a day that can be digitized.

91
0:03:56.501,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough,

92
0:03:58.748,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because these documents,

93
0:04:00.035,000 --> 0:04:02,000
most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,

94
0:04:02.689,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in Venetian dialect,

95
0:04:04.204,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so you need to transcribe them,

96
0:04:05.879,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to translate them in some cases,

97
0:04:07.56,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to index them,

98
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and this is obviously not easy.

99
0:04:10.844,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In particular, traditional optical character recognition method

100
0:04:14.688,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that can be used for printed manuscripts,

101
0:04:16.112,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they do not work well on the handwritten document.

102
0:04:20.116,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So the solution is actually to take inspiration

103
0:04:22.246,000 --> 0:04:24,000
from another domain: speech recognition.

104
0:04:25.147,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This is a domain of something that seems impossible,

105
0:04:27.202,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which can actually be done,

106
0:04:29.739,000 --> 0:04:31,000
simply by putting additional constraints.

107
0:04:31.933,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If you have a very good model

108
0:04:33.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of a language which is used,

109
0:04:35.045,000 --> 0:04:37,000
if you have a very good model of a document,

110
0:04:37.131,000 --> 0:04:38,000
how well they are structured.

111
0:04:38.563,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And these are administrative documents.

112
0:04:39.931,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They are well structured in many cases.

113
0:04:42.063,000 --> 0:04:45,000
If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets

114
0:04:45.371,000 --> 0:04:47,000
where a smaller subset actually shares similar features,

115
0:04:48.248,000 --> 0:04:52,000
then there's a chance of success.

116
0:04:54.761,000 --> 0:04:56,000
If we reach that stage, then there's something else:

117
0:04:57.196,000 --> 0:05:,000
we can extract from this document events.

118
0:05:00.718,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Actually probably 10 billion events

119
0:05:03.016,000 --> 0:05:04,000
can be extracted from this archive.

120
0:05:04.947,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this giant information system

121
0:05:06.671,000 --> 0:05:07,000
can be searched in many ways.

122
0:05:08.487,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You can ask questions like,

123
0:05:09.855,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"

124
0:05:12.615,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market

125
0:05:14.837,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in 1434?"

126
0:05:16.561,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"What was the salary

127
0:05:18.021,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of a glass maker in Murano

128
0:05:20.066,000 --> 0:05:21,000
maybe over a decade?"

129
0:05:21.472,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You can ask even bigger questions

130
0:05:22.894,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because it will be semantically coded.

131
0:05:25.632,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And then what you can do is put that in space,

132
0:05:27.772,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because much of this information is spatial.

133
0:05:29.945,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And from that, you can do things like

134
0:05:31.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
reconstructing this extraordinary journey

135
0:05:33.993,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of that city that managed to have a sustainable development

136
0:05:37.349,000 --> 0:05:39,000
over a thousand years,

137
0:05:39.475,000 --> 0:05:4,000
managing to have all the time

138
0:05:41.095,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a form of equilibrium with its environment.

139
0:05:43.956,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You can reconstruct that journey,

140
0:05:45.204,000 --> 0:05:47,000
visualize it in many different ways.

141
0:05:48.1,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But of course, you cannot understand Venice if you just look at the city.

142
0:05:50.799,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You have to put it in a larger European context.

143
0:05:53.195,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So the idea is also to document all the things

144
0:05:56.016,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that worked at the European level.

145
0:05:58.439,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We can reconstruct also the journey

146
0:06:00.403,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of the Venetian maritime empire,

147
0:06:02.393,000 --> 0:06:05,000
how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,

148
0:06:05.559,000 --> 0:06:08,000
how it became the most powerful medieval empire

149
0:06:09.305,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of its time,

150
0:06:10.866,000 --> 0:06:12,000
controlling most of the sea routes

151
0:06:13.038,000 --> 0:06:15,000
from the east to the south.

152
0:06:17.305,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But you can even do other things,

153
0:06:19.621,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because in these maritime routes,

154
0:06:21.898,000 --> 0:06:22,000
there are regular patterns.

155
0:06:23.889,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You can go one step beyond

156
0:06:26.382,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and actually create a simulation system,

157
0:06:28.502,000 --> 0:06:3,000
create a Mediterranean simulator

158
0:06:31.317,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is capable actually of reconstructing

159
0:06:33.91,000 --> 0:06:35,000
even the information we are missing,

160
0:06:36.112,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which would enable us to have questions you could ask

161
0:06:39.1,000 --> 0:06:41,000
like if you were using a route planner.

162
0:06:42.088,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"If I am in Corfu in June 1323

163
0:06:45.159,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and want to go to Constantinople,

164
0:06:47.685,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where can I take a boat?"

165
0:06:49.828,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Probably we can answer this question

166
0:06:51.195,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with one or two or three days' precision.

167
0:06:55.668,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"How much will it cost?"

168
0:06:57.275,000 --> 0:07:,000
"What are the chance of encountering pirates?"

169
0:07:00.867,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Of course, you understand,

170
0:07:02.678,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the central scientific challenge of a project like this one

171
0:07:05.287,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is qualifying, quantifying and representing

172
0:07:09.016,000 --> 0:07:12,000
uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process.

173
0:07:12.346,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There are errors everywhere,

174
0:07:15.058,000 --> 0:07:17,000
errors in the document, it's the wrong name of the captain,

175
0:07:17.547,000 --> 0:07:2,000
some of the boats never actually took to sea.

176
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There are errors in translation, interpretative biases,

177
0:07:25.624,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,

178
0:07:29.09,000 --> 0:07:31,000
you're going to have errors in recognition,

179
0:07:32.039,000 --> 0:07:33,000
errors in extraction,

180
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so you have very, very uncertain data.

181
0:07:38.481,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies?

182
0:07:42.238,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How can we represent that form of uncertainty?

183
0:07:45.898,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's difficult. One thing you can do

184
0:07:47.995,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is document each step of the process,

185
0:07:50.221,000 --> 0:07:52,000
not only coding the historical information

186
0:07:52.669,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but what we call the meta-historical information,

187
0:07:55.348,000 --> 0:07:57,000
how is historical knowledge constructed,

188
0:07:58.011,000 --> 0:07:59,000
documenting each step.

189
0:08:00.009,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That will not guarantee that we actually converge

190
0:08:01.654,000 --> 0:08:03,000
toward a single story of Venice,

191
0:08:04.104,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but probably we can actually reconstruct

192
0:08:06.242,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a fully documented potential story of Venice.

193
0:08:09.29,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Maybe there's not a single map.

194
0:08:10.749,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Maybe there are several maps.

195
0:08:12.869,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The system should allow for that,

196
0:08:15.085,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty,

197
0:08:17.944,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which is really new for this type of giant databases.

198
0:08:22.585,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And how should we communicate

199
0:08:24.79,000 --> 0:08:27,000
this new research to a large audience?

200
0:08:28.769,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Again, Venice is extraordinary for that.

201
0:08:31.432,000 --> 0:08:33,000
With the millions of visitors that come every year,

202
0:08:33.603,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it's actually one of the best places

203
0:08:35.366,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to try to invent the museum of the future.

204
0:08:38.354,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map

205
0:08:41.658,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of a given year,

206
0:08:42.944,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and vertically, you see the document

207
0:08:45.902,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that served the reconstruction,

208
0:08:47.413,000 --> 0:08:5,000
paintings, for instance.

209
0:08:50.813,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Imagine an immersive system that permits

210
0:08:53.393,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year,

211
0:08:56.895,000 --> 0:08:58,000
some experience you could share within a group.

212
0:08:59.61,000 --> 0:09:01,000
On the contrary, imagine actually that you start

213
0:09:01.856,000 --> 0:09:03,000
from a document, a Venetian manuscript,

214
0:09:04.063,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and you show, actually, what you can construct out of it,

215
0:09:07.112,000 --> 0:09:08,000
how it is decoded,

216
0:09:08.884,000 --> 0:09:1,000
how the context of that document can be recreated.

217
0:09:11.299,000 --> 0:09:12,000
This is an image from an exhibit

218
0:09:13.184,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which is currently conducted in Geneva

219
0:09:15.46,000 --> 0:09:17,000
with that type of system.

220
0:09:17.814,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So to conclude, we can say that

221
0:09:19.989,000 --> 0:09:22,000
research in the humanities is about to undergo

222
0:09:23.068,000 --> 0:09:24,000
an evolution which is maybe similar

223
0:09:24.87,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.

224
0:09:29.452,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's really a question of scale.

225
0:09:34.13,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We see projects which are

226
0:09:37.433,000 --> 0:09:4,000
much beyond any single research team can do,

227
0:09:41.276,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and this is really new for the humanities,

228
0:09:43.519,000 --> 0:09:46,000
which very often take the habit of working

229
0:09:47.388,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in small groups or only with a couple of researchers.

230
0:09:51.396,000 --> 0:09:53,000
When you visit the Archivio di Stato,

231
0:09:53.514,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you feel this is beyond what any single team can do,

232
0:09:56.336,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and that should be a joint and common effort.

233
0:10:00.17,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So what we must do for this paradigm shift

234
0:10:03.276,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is actually foster a new generation

235
0:10:05.178,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of "digital humanists"

236
0:10:06.715,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that are going to be ready for this shift.

237
0:10:08.805,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I thank you very much.

238
0:10:10.764,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

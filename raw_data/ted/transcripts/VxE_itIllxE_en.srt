1
0:00:12.889,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Tom Zimmerman: We'd like to take you on a fantastic journey

2
0:00:16.254,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to visit the creatures we call the Elders.

3
0:00:19.389,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We call them the Elders because a half a billion years ago

4
0:00:23.387,000 --> 0:00:25,000
they tripled the amount of oxygen in the air,

5
0:00:26.363,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which led to an explosion of life,

6
0:00:29.315,000 --> 0:00:3,000
which led to all of us.

7
0:00:31.67,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We call them the Elders, but you probably know them as plankton.

8
0:00:35.631,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:36.701,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, Simone is a physicist, and I'm an inventor.

10
0:00:41.894,000 --> 0:00:42,000
A couple of years ago,

11
0:00:43.094,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was giving a talk about an invention I made --

12
0:00:45.365,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it was a 3D microscope.

13
0:00:46.903,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And Simone was in the audience.

14
0:00:49.244,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He realized that my microscope could solve a big problem he was having.

15
0:00:53.861,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Which was, how to measure the movement of plankton in 3D fast enough

16
0:00:58.561,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so he could mathematically model their sensing and behavior.

17
0:01:03.665,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I frankly needed an application for my microscope, so ...

18
0:01:07.431,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.863,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It was like peanut butter meets chocolate.

20
0:01:10.983,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:12.419,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So we started working together, studying these amazing creatures.

22
0:01:16.489,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And then we were alarmed to discover something.

23
0:01:19.696,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And that's why we're here today.

24
0:01:21.833,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I just want to do something with you.

25
0:01:24.23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, please, just hold your breath for a second.

26
0:01:28.047,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Yes, literally hold your breath.

27
0:01:29.761,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is the world without plankton.

28
0:01:33.161,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You see, plankton generate two-thirds of our oxygen using the sun.

29
0:01:37.875,000 --> 0:01:39,000
OK, now you can breathe, because they're still here.

30
0:01:41.145,000 --> 0:01:42,000
For now.

31
0:01:43.458,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Simone Bianco: As many of you know,

32
0:01:45.223,000 --> 0:01:48,000
since 1950, the average surface temperature of the earth

33
0:01:48.252,000 --> 0:01:5,000
has increased by one degree Centigrade

34
0:01:50.744,000 --> 0:01:53,000
due to all the carbon dioxide we are pumping into the air.

35
0:01:54.784,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, while this temperature increase may not seem like a big deal to us,

36
0:01:58.538,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it is to plankton.

37
0:01:59.95,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Indirect measurements have shown that the global phytoplankton population

38
0:02:04.403,000 --> 0:02:09,000
may have decreased by as much as 40 percent between 1950 and 2010

39
0:02:09.489,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because of climate change.

40
0:02:11.03,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And you see, this is a problem

41
0:02:12.71,000 --> 0:02:15,000
also because it's starving the fish that eat them.

42
0:02:16.196,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And about a billion people around the world

43
0:02:18.538,000 --> 0:02:21,000
depend on fish as their primary source of protein from animals.

44
0:02:23.109,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So you see, this isn't just about breathing.

45
0:02:25.792,000 --> 0:02:27,000
No plankton means no fish.

46
0:02:27.997,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And that is a lot of food we will need to replace.

47
0:02:31.117,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There's something else that is interesting.

48
0:02:33.355,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The bodies of plankton's ancestors

49
0:02:35.482,000 --> 0:02:37,000
actually make up a for lot of the carbon we burn today.

50
0:02:38.883,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me.

51
0:02:41.03,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because the plankton that are here today clean that carbon out of the air.

52
0:02:46.252,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But you see, they don't really hold a grudge.

53
0:02:48.507,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:50.109,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The problem is they cannot keep up

55
0:02:52.602,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with the tremendous amount of carbon we are dumping into the air.

56
0:02:57.093,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So what does all of this mean?

57
0:02:58.784,000 --> 0:03:,000
Well, it means that our big carbon footprint

58
0:03:01.172,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is crushing the very creatures that sustain us.

59
0:03:04.784,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And yes, like Tom said,

60
0:03:06.173,000 --> 0:03:08,000
killing almost half of the creatures that allow us to breathe

61
0:03:09.188,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is a really big deal.

62
0:03:11.307,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So you're probably asking yourself:

63
0:03:13.315,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why aren't we doing something about it?

64
0:03:16.009,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Our theory is that plankton are tiny,

65
0:03:19.35,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it's really, really hard to care about something you cannot see.

66
0:03:23.27,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You see, there's a quote I really like in "The Little Prince" that goes,

67
0:03:26.688,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"What is essential is invisible to the eye."

68
0:03:29.236,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We really believe that if more people could come

69
0:03:32.483,000 --> 0:03:36,000
face to ... cilia with plankton,

70
0:03:36.862,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there is a greater chance we could all rally together

71
0:03:39.419,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and save these creatures

72
0:03:40.618,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that are so important to life on our planet.

73
0:03:42.823,000 --> 0:03:43,000
TZ: Exactly, Simone.

74
0:03:44.379,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So to do this,

75
0:03:45.95,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we're going to bring you scuba diving with plankton.

76
0:03:51.013,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But I just need to shrink you by a factor of 1000,

77
0:03:54.665,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to a scale where the diameter of a human hair is as big as my hand.

78
0:03:59.657,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I happen to have invented a machine to do just that.

79
0:04:03.292,000 --> 0:04:06,000
SB: Anyone here remember "Fantastic Voyage"

80
0:04:06.633,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or "Innerspace?"

81
0:04:08.387,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

82
0:04:09.562,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Martin Short is one of my all-time favorite actors.

83
0:04:13.45,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And now this -- this is just like that.

84
0:04:16.641,000 --> 0:04:17,000
TZ: Indeed, yes.

85
0:04:17.856,000 --> 0:04:19,000
When I was a boy, I saw "Fantastic Voyage,"

86
0:04:19.91,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and I really loved how I could travel through the bloodstream

87
0:04:23.138,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and see biology work on a cellular level.

88
0:04:26.149,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I've always been inspired by science fiction.

89
0:04:28.815,000 --> 0:04:31,000
As an inventor, I try and turn fantasy into reality.

90
0:04:32.966,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I once invented this glove

91
0:04:35.672,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which let me travel and help people like you explore the virtual world.

92
0:04:40.292,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So now I've invented this machine

93
0:04:42.157,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to let us explore the microscopic world.

94
0:04:45.101,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's not virtual, it's real.

95
0:04:47.085,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Just really, really tiny.

96
0:04:49.203,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's based on the microscope that got Simone's attention.

97
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, here's how it works.

98
0:04:54.434,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I have an image sensor

99
0:04:56.394,000 --> 0:04:58,000
like the kind in your cell phone, behind the lens.

100
0:04:59.188,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And then I have a little tray of plankton water

101
0:05:01.68,000 --> 0:05:02,000
like you might find from a river

102
0:05:03.452,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or my fish tank, which I never change the water on.

103
0:05:05.911,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:07.125,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because I love plankton.

105
0:05:08.324,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:11.872,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And underneath I have a light, an LED,

107
0:05:15.022,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which is going to cast shadows of the plankton on the image sensor.

108
0:05:19.887,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And now this silver thing is an XY plotter,

109
0:05:22.617,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so I can move the image sensor to follow the plankton as they swim.

110
0:05:27.752,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now comes the fantasy part.

111
0:05:30.485,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:32.141,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I put a tilt sensor on this helmet

113
0:05:35.585,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so I can control the microscope with my head.

114
0:05:39.871,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And now let's look at the video from this image sensor.

115
0:05:44.466,000 --> 0:05:46,000
These are all plankton.

116
0:05:46.561,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is in that little tray,

117
0:05:48.506,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and with my head, I can move the microscope.

118
0:05:53.212,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So now we're ready to go scuba diving with plankton.

119
0:05:56.807,000 --> 0:05:58,000
My head will be the navigator,

120
0:05:59.141,000 --> 0:06:,000
and Simone will be our tour guide.

121
0:06:01.053,000 --> 0:06:02,000
SB: Yes.

122
0:06:02.228,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:03.253,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So welcome all to the wonderful world of life in a drop of water.

124
0:06:07.728,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Actually, as you can see,

125
0:06:09.057,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with this instrument, we are not at all limited to a single drop.

126
0:06:13.106,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Alright, let's find something.

127
0:06:15.178,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The little creatures you see in the center of your screen,

128
0:06:18.344,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they are called rotifer.

129
0:06:19.86,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They are the garbage collectors of our waters.

130
0:06:22.442,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They break down organic matter

131
0:06:24.522,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and allow it to be reclaimed by the environment.

132
0:06:27.347,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now, you know, nature is an amazing recycler.

133
0:06:30.427,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Structures are continuously built, they are decomposed and recycled,

134
0:06:34.974,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and all of that is powered by solar energy.

135
0:06:37.403,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But just think.

136
0:06:38.593,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Think about what will happen if, you know, our garbage collectors

137
0:06:42.609,000 --> 0:06:44,000
didn't come anymore, if they disappeared.

138
0:06:45.362,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Something else? Let's look for something else.

139
0:06:47.529,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Oh, look at that.

140
0:06:48.713,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You see the big ice-cream-cone-shaped things?

141
0:06:52.126,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Those are called Stentor, those are amazing creatures.

142
0:06:55.95,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You know, they are big, but they are a single cell.

143
0:06:58.72,000 --> 0:07:,000
You remember the rotifer we just met?

144
0:07:00.934,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's about half a millimeter, it's about 1,000 cells --

145
0:07:04.292,000 --> 0:07:08,000
it's typically 15 for the brain, 15 for the stomach

146
0:07:08.419,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you know, about the same for reproduction,

147
0:07:10.633,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which is kind of the right mix, if you ask me.

148
0:07:13.22,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:14.245,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But ... right?

150
0:07:16.116,000 --> 0:07:17,000
TZ: I agree.

151
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:19,000
SB: But a Stentor is only a single cell.

152
0:07:19.577,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And it's able to sense and react to its environment.

153
0:07:22.292,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You see, it will swim forward when it's happy;

154
0:07:25.212,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it will swim backward when it's trying to get away from something

155
0:07:28.3,000 --> 0:07:3,000
like, you know, a toxic chemical.

156
0:07:30.713,000 --> 0:07:32,000
With our friends in the Center for Cellular Construction

157
0:07:33.633,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the help of the National Science Foundation,

158
0:07:36.093,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we are using Stentor to sense the presence of contamination in food and water,

159
0:07:40.665,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which I think is really cool.

160
0:07:42.379,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Alright, last one.

161
0:07:43.807,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So the dots that you see there that are, let's say, behind everything,

162
0:07:47.527,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they're algae.

163
0:07:48.736,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They are the creatures that provide the majority of oxygen in the air.

164
0:07:53.434,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They convert solar light and carbon dioxide

165
0:07:56.387,000 --> 0:07:58,000
into the oxygen that is filling your lungs right now.

166
0:07:59.212,000 --> 0:08:,000
So you see, we all got algae breath.

167
0:08:01.165,000 --> 0:08:02,000
TZ: (Exhales)

168
0:08:02.34,000 --> 0:08:03,000
SB: Yay! (Laughter)

169
0:08:03.958,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You know, there's something interesting.

170
0:08:05.895,000 --> 0:08:1,000
About a billion years ago, ancient plants got their photosynthesis capability

171
0:08:10.958,000 --> 0:08:13,000
by incorporating tiny, tiny plankton into their cells.

172
0:08:14.695,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That's exactly like us putting solar panels on top of our roofs.

173
0:08:19.212,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So you see, the microscopic world is even more amazing than science fiction.

174
0:08:23.641,000 --> 0:08:24,000
TZ: Oh, indeed.

175
0:08:24.823,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So now you've seen how vital plankton are to our lives

176
0:08:28.522,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and how much we need them.

177
0:08:30.418,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If we kill the plankton, we will die

178
0:08:33.252,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of asphyxiation or starvation, take your pick.

179
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes.

180
0:08:39.497,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:40.95,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In the game of plankton, you win or you die.

182
0:08:44.886,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:47.886,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, what amazes me is, we have known about global warming

184
0:08:53.292,000 --> 0:08:54,000
for over a century.

185
0:08:55.251,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Ever since the Swedish scientist, Arrhenius,

186
0:08:57.973,000 --> 0:08:59,000
calculated the effect of burning fossil fuel

187
0:09:00.641,000 --> 0:09:01,000
on the earth's temperature.

188
0:09:02.299,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We've known about this for a long time, but it's not too late if we act now.

189
0:09:07.211,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Yes, yes, I know, I know, our world is based on fossil fuels,

190
0:09:11.474,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but we can adjust our society to run on renewable energy from the Sun

191
0:09:16.069,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to create a more sustainable and secure future.

192
0:09:19.093,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That's good for the little creatures here, the plankton,

193
0:09:21.832,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and that good for us -- here's why.

194
0:09:25.077,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The three greatest concerns of people all around the globe

195
0:09:28.768,000 --> 0:09:3,000
typically are jobs, violence and health.

196
0:09:32.379,000 --> 0:09:33,000
A job means food and shelter.

197
0:09:34.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Look at these creatures, they're swimming around,

198
0:09:36.95,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they're looking for a place to eat and reproduce.

199
0:09:39.99,000 --> 0:09:41,000
If a single cell is programmed to do that,

200
0:09:42.942,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it's no surprise that 30 trillion cells have the same agenda.

201
0:09:48.053,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Violence.

202
0:09:49.625,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Dependence on fossil fuels makes a country vulnerable.

203
0:09:54.195,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Which leads to conflicts all around the oil resources.

204
0:10:00.085,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Solar energy, on the other hand, is distributed around the whole globe,

205
0:10:03.927,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and no one can blockade the sun.

206
0:10:06.596,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:07.99,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then, finally, health.

208
0:10:10.13,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette.

209
0:10:13.773,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And in my opinion, coal is like an unfiltered type.

210
0:10:18.305,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now, just like smoking, the best time to quit is when?

211
0:10:22.903,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Audience: Now.

212
0:10:24.093,000 --> 0:10:25,000
TZ: Now! Not when you get lung cancer.

213
0:10:26.513,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now I know if you look around, some people may abandon facts and reason.

214
0:10:32.458,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Only until suffering --

215
0:10:34.181,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:35.206,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Yes, they will abandon facts and reason.

217
0:10:38.077,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But suffering will eventually and inevitably force change.

218
0:10:43.354,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But let's instead use our neocortex, our new brain,

219
0:10:47.743,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to save the Elders, some of the oldest creatures on the earth.

220
0:10:50.846,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And let's apply science to harness the energy

221
0:10:54.823,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that has fueled the Elders for millions of years --

222
0:10:59.649,000 --> 0:11:,000
the sun.

223
0:11:01.056,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you.

224
0:11:02.238,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.106,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So the machine I'm going to talk you about

3
0:00:13.53,000 --> 0:00:14,000
is what I call the greatest machine that never was.

4
0:00:15.204,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was a machine that was never built,

5
0:00:17.203,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and yet, it will be built.

6
0:00:19.583,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It was a machine that was designed

7
0:00:21.575,000 --> 0:00:23,000
long before anyone thought about computers.

8
0:00:23.926,000 --> 0:00:25,000
If you know anything about the history of computers,

9
0:00:26.075,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you will know that in the '30s and the '40s,

10
0:00:28.595,000 --> 0:00:3,000
simple computers were created

11
0:00:31.15,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that started the computer revolution we have today,

12
0:00:33.943,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and you would be correct,

13
0:00:35.229,000 --> 0:00:37,000
except for you'd have the wrong century.

14
0:00:37.711,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The first computer was really designed

15
0:00:39.351,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.

16
0:00:43.023,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,

17
0:00:45.351,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the bits of it that were built are here

18
0:00:47.487,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in South Kensington.

19
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.

20
0:00:52.799,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage

21
0:00:54.555,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because his hair is always completely unkempt like this

22
0:00:57.164,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in every single picture. (Laughter)

23
0:00:59.505,000 --> 0:01:,000
He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,

24
0:01:01.352,000 --> 0:01:03,000
part of the aristocracy of Britain,

25
0:01:03.365,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,

26
0:01:05.704,000 --> 0:01:07,000
were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,

27
0:01:08.135,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you would have been invited round to his house

28
0:01:09.631,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for a soiree — and he invited everybody:

29
0:01:12.59,000 --> 0:01:15,000
kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —

30
0:01:16.022,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

31
0:01:18.543,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I really miss that era, you know, where you could

32
0:01:21.583,000 --> 0:01:23,000
go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer

33
0:01:23.931,000 --> 0:01:24,000
get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)

34
0:01:25.044,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But Babbage, Babbage himself was born

35
0:01:28.31,000 --> 0:01:29,000
at the end of the 18th century,

36
0:01:30.044,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and was a fairly famous mathematician.

37
0:01:32.088,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,

38
0:01:35.231,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.

39
0:01:37.743,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He's less well known than either of them because

40
0:01:40.598,000 --> 0:01:43,000
he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices

41
0:01:43.748,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and never made any of them.

42
0:01:46.033,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.

43
0:01:49.318,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think,

44
0:01:51.329,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.

45
0:01:52.777,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.

46
0:01:55.372,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."

47
0:01:57.732,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,

48
0:02:00.612,000 --> 0:02:02,000
basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,

49
0:02:03.076,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,

50
0:02:05.517,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)

51
0:02:08.669,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,

52
0:02:10.649,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,

53
0:02:14.088,000 --> 0:02:15,000
this is a view from above.

54
0:02:15.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,

55
0:02:19.073,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.

56
0:02:22.309,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine

57
0:02:24.3,000 --> 0:02:26,000
this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds

58
0:02:26.944,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of what this thing would have sounded like.

59
0:02:28.704,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine

60
0:02:30.481,000 --> 0:02:31,000
— that's why it's computer architecture —

61
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.

62
0:02:35.287,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So let's talk about the memory. The memory

63
0:02:38.69,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is very like the memory of a computer today,

64
0:02:40.937,000 --> 0:02:42,000
except it was all made out of metal,

65
0:02:43.639,000 --> 0:02:46,000
stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.

66
0:02:47.183,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Imagine a thing this high of cogs,

67
0:02:49.253,000 --> 0:02:5,000
hundreds and hundreds of them,

68
0:02:51.008,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they've got numbers on them.

69
0:02:52.898,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.

70
0:02:55.317,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And he thought about using binary. The problem

71
0:02:56.902,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with using binary is that the machine would have been so

72
0:02:58.62,000 --> 0:03:01,000
tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.

73
0:03:01.937,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So he's got memory.

74
0:03:03.996,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The memory is this bit over here.

75
0:03:06.403,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You see it all like this.

76
0:03:08.733,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.

77
0:03:13.268,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Of course, it's this big.

78
0:03:15.518,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.

79
0:03:18.431,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU

80
0:03:22.572,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is in the Science Museum.

81
0:03:24.711,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic --

82
0:03:28.343,000 --> 0:03:3,000
so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division --

83
0:03:30.796,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which already is a bit of a feat in metal,

84
0:03:33.804,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but it could also do something that a computer does

85
0:03:36.433,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and a calculator doesn't:

86
0:03:38.132,000 --> 0:03:41,000
this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.

87
0:03:42.07,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers,

88
0:03:44.936,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and that fundamentally made it into a computer.

89
0:03:47.076,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.

90
0:03:51.674,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,

91
0:03:54.355,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and we think about chips today, we can't

92
0:03:56.226,000 --> 0:03:59,000
look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.

93
0:04:00.041,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Yet if you did, you would see something

94
0:04:01.842,000 --> 0:04:02,000
very, very similar to this.

95
0:04:03.664,000 --> 0:04:05,000
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU,

96
0:04:06.611,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and this incredible regularity in the memory.

97
0:04:09.303,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,

98
0:04:10.965,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you'll see this. This all looks the same,

99
0:04:12.934,000 --> 0:04:14,000
then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.

100
0:04:15.5,000 --> 0:04:18,000
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,

101
0:04:19.483,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,

102
0:04:21.576,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Babbage used the technology of the day

103
0:04:24.601,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,

104
0:04:28.247,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which is punch cards. This thing over here

105
0:04:31.116,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is one of three punch card readers in here,

106
0:04:33.94,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and this is a program in the Science Museum, just

107
0:04:37.62,000 --> 0:04:41,000
not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,

108
0:04:42.013,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that is sitting there — you can go see it —

109
0:04:43.881,000 --> 0:04:45,000
waiting for the machine to be built.

110
0:04:46.322,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.

111
0:04:49.742,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.

112
0:04:52.832,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,

113
0:04:54.805,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in France, had created the Jacquard loom,

114
0:04:56.977,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,

115
0:04:59.655,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,

116
0:05:02.287,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and like everything else he did, he's using the technology

117
0:05:04.392,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,

118
0:05:09.139,000 --> 0:05:12,000
mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year

119
0:05:13.077,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,

120
0:05:15.249,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who would completely revolutionize everything

121
0:05:17.926,000 --> 0:05:19,000
with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.

122
0:05:20.439,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,

123
0:05:23.597,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so steam and things.

124
0:05:25.15,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now, he needed accessories.

125
0:05:26.823,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Obviously, you've got a computer now.

126
0:05:28.495,000 --> 0:05:3,000
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.

127
0:05:30.884,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You need accessories you're going to come with.

128
0:05:32.819,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You're not just going to have that,

129
0:05:34.447,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,

130
0:05:37.275,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —

131
0:05:39.429,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,

132
0:05:41.774,000 --> 0:05:42,000
there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)

133
0:05:43.744,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And there's actually an instruction on the punch card

134
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"

135
0:05:48.182,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,

136
0:05:50.382,000 --> 0:05:51,000
this thing, "Click, clack click click click,"

137
0:05:51.463,000 --> 0:05:53,000
steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)

138
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.

139
0:05:56.835,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for

140
0:05:59.843,000 --> 0:06:01,000
another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,

141
0:06:02.326,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which he never built, but which the Science Museum

142
0:06:04.261,000 --> 0:06:06,000
did build in the '80s and '90s.

143
0:06:06.432,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.

144
0:06:08.707,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,

145
0:06:11.405,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,

146
0:06:14.922,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.

147
0:06:17.694,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You also need graphics, right?

148
0:06:19.344,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,

149
0:06:20.9,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper

150
0:06:23.496,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and an ink pen and I'll make it plot."

151
0:06:25.604,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So he designed a plotter as well,

152
0:06:27.434,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much

153
0:06:31.359,000 --> 0:06:32,000
a pretty good machine.

154
0:06:32.89,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.

155
0:06:35.58,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.

156
0:06:38.301,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad

157
0:06:41.393,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,

158
0:06:43.815,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have

159
0:06:46.335,000 --> 0:06:48,000
inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,

160
0:06:49.192,000 --> 0:06:52,000
thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.

161
0:06:52.43,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."

162
0:06:55.379,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter) Because of course,

163
0:06:59.135,000 --> 0:07:02,000
there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,

164
0:07:03.05,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)

165
0:07:05.451,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,

166
0:07:08.789,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,

167
0:07:11.527,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.

168
0:07:14.317,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,

169
0:07:16.151,000 --> 0:07:17,000
get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,

170
0:07:17.723,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,

171
0:07:21.474,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who said, "I understand what this does,

172
0:07:22.766,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and I understand the future of this machine."

173
0:07:24.973,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know

174
0:07:28.06,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build

175
0:07:31.037,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because of her.

176
0:07:32.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, some people call her the first programmer.

177
0:07:35.397,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.

178
0:07:38.783,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is a program written in a particular style.

179
0:07:41.694,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,

180
0:07:45.263,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and actually, she did something more amazing.

181
0:07:47.316,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Rather than just being a programmer,

182
0:07:48.886,000 --> 0:07:5,000
she saw something that Babbage didn't.

183
0:07:51.058,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.

184
0:07:54.242,000 --> 0:07:57,000
He was building a machine to do mathematics,

185
0:07:58.191,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics

186
0:08:01.45,000 --> 0:08:03,000
on this machine." And just as you do,

187
0:08:04.285,000 --> 0:08:05,000
everyone in this room already's got a computer on them

188
0:08:05.91,000 --> 0:08:07,000
right now, because they've got a phone.

189
0:08:07.964,000 --> 0:08:09,000
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone

190
0:08:10.192,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or computer or any other computing device

191
0:08:12.207,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.

192
0:08:14.288,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,

193
0:08:18.981,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,

194
0:08:22.961,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing

195
0:08:25.066,000 --> 0:08:28,000
mathematical functions and symbols

196
0:08:28.388,000 --> 0:08:3,000
doesn't mean these things can't represent

197
0:08:30.635,000 --> 0:08:33,000
other things in the real world, such as music."

198
0:08:33.988,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,

199
0:08:36.722,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"We could compute these amazing functions and print out

200
0:08:38.944,000 --> 0:08:41,000
tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) —

201
0:08:42.612,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,

202
0:08:44.508,000 --> 0:08:46,000
this thing could even compose music if you

203
0:08:46.984,000 --> 0:08:49,000
told it a representation of music numerically."

204
0:08:50.532,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.

205
0:08:52.101,000 --> 0:08:55,000
When you say she's a programmer, she did do some,

206
0:08:55.838,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be

207
0:08:58.975,000 --> 0:09:,000
much, much more than this.

208
0:09:01.171,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,

209
0:09:03.35,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.

210
0:09:08.803,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.

211
0:09:11.38,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.

212
0:09:13.911,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,

213
0:09:16.702,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but Turing told us something very important.

214
0:09:19.255,000 --> 0:09:21,000
He laid down the mathematical foundations

215
0:09:22.19,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for computer science, and said,

216
0:09:24.303,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"It doesn't matter how you make a computer."

217
0:09:27.49,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,

218
0:09:29.368,000 --> 0:09:33,000
like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,

219
0:09:33.778,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,

220
0:09:36.582,000 --> 0:09:39,000
mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.

221
0:09:39.728,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We could go back to Babbage's machine

222
0:09:41.765,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.

223
0:09:44.341,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There is in a sense a computing essence.

224
0:09:45.973,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.

225
0:09:47.978,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say

226
0:09:50.645,000 --> 0:09:52,000
this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.

227
0:09:52.868,000 --> 0:09:54,000
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today

228
0:09:55.693,000 --> 0:09:59,000
with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)

229
0:10:00.525,000 --> 0:10:02,000
To give you an idea of how slowly,

230
0:10:02.631,000 --> 0:10:05,000
it had about 1k of memory.

231
0:10:06.47,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It used punch cards, which were being fed in,

232
0:10:09.388,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.

233
0:10:15.148,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It did have a RAM pack.

234
0:10:16.751,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.

235
0:10:19.93,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?

236
0:10:22.256,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So there are plans.

237
0:10:23.864,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,

238
0:10:26.797,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages

239
0:10:28.491,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.

240
0:10:31.96,000 --> 0:10:34,000
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,

241
0:10:35.921,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and that is also the name of a charity that I started

242
0:10:38.075,000 --> 0:10:4,000
with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing

243
0:10:40.809,000 --> 0:10:42,000
at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove

244
0:10:43.048,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the project to build a difference engine,

245
0:10:44.478,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and our plan is to build it.

246
0:10:47.036,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.

247
0:10:50.902,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The project has a number of parts to it.

248
0:10:52.904,000 --> 0:10:54,000
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.

249
0:10:55.424,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That's been done. The second is now the study

250
0:10:57.346,000 --> 0:11:,000
of all of those plans to determine what to build.

251
0:11:00.456,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,

252
0:11:04.9,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.

253
0:11:07.823,000 --> 0:11:09,000
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,

254
0:11:10.399,000 --> 0:11:11,000
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,

255
0:11:12.233,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,

256
0:11:14.843,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,

257
0:11:18.178,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)

258
0:11:22.045,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.

259
0:11:24.644,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Babbage himself wrote, he said,

260
0:11:26.401,000 --> 0:11:27,000
as soon as the analytical engine exists,

261
0:11:28.019,000 --> 0:11:31,000
it will surely guide the future course of science.

262
0:11:31.723,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling

263
0:11:33.568,000 --> 0:11:35,000
with new plans, but when it did get built, of course,

264
0:11:35.65,000 --> 0:11:38,000
in the 1940s, everything changed.

265
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like

266
0:11:40.983,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in motion with a video which shows

267
0:11:43.616,000 --> 0:11:47,000
just one part of the CPU mechanism working.

268
0:11:51.21,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So this is just three sets of cogs,

269
0:11:54.209,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism

270
0:11:57.031,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.

271
0:11:59.688,000 --> 0:12:,000
So, give me five years.

272
0:12:00.847,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.

273
0:12:03.191,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

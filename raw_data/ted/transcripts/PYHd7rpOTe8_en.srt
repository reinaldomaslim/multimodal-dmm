Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.713,000 --> 0:00:14,000
That's how we traveled in the year 1900.

3
0:00:15.422,000 --> 0:00:17,000
That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.

4
0:00:17.791,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It doesn't have air conditioning.

5
0:00:19.42,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That horse is pulling it along

6
0:00:21.477,000 --> 0:00:23,000
at one percent of the speed of sound,

7
0:00:23.775,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and the rutted dirt road

8
0:00:25.527,000 --> 0:00:29,000
turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.

9
0:00:29.909,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That's a Boeing 707.

10
0:00:32.654,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Only 60 years later, it travels

11
0:00:34.955,000 --> 0:00:36,000
at 80 percent of the speed of sound,

12
0:00:37.172,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and we don't travel any faster today

13
0:00:39.805,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because commercial supersonic air travel

14
0:00:42.944,000 --> 0:00:43,000
turned out to be a bust.

15
0:00:44.913,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I started wondering and pondering,

16
0:00:47.465,000 --> 0:00:5,000
could it be that the best years of American economic growth

17
0:00:50.487,000 --> 0:00:51,000
are behind us?

18
0:00:52.146,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth

19
0:00:56.625,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is almost over.

20
0:00:58.852,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.

21
0:01:02.614,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There are four headwinds that are just hitting

22
0:01:04.988,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the American economy in the face.

23
0:01:07.373,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They're demographics, education, debt and inequality.

24
0:01:12.031,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.

25
0:01:15.664,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.

26
0:01:20.322,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,

27
0:01:23.09,000 --> 0:01:25,000
if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been

28
0:01:25.771,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.

29
0:01:29.638,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If innovation is less powerful,

30
0:01:32.349,000 --> 0:01:34,000
invents less great, wonderful things,

31
0:01:34.803,000 --> 0:01:38,000
then growth is going to be even lower than half of history.

32
0:01:38.813,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now here's eight centuries of economic growth.

33
0:01:41.968,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,

34
0:01:45.632,000 --> 0:01:48,000
zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.

35
0:01:48.755,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.

36
0:01:51.655,000 --> 0:01:53,000
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,

37
0:01:54.186,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when the line switches to red.

38
0:01:55.677,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You'll notice that, for the first four centuries,

39
0:01:57.663,000 --> 0:02:,000
there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.

40
0:02:01.533,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Then growth gets better and better.

41
0:02:03.152,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,

42
0:02:06.13,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.

43
0:02:09.887,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That last downward notch in the red line

44
0:02:12.383,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is not actual data.

45
0:02:14.614,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That is a forecast that I made six years ago

46
0:02:17.754,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.

47
0:02:20.383,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But you know what the actual facts are?

48
0:02:22.393,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You know what the growth in per-person income has been

49
0:02:24.206,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the United States in the last six years?

50
0:02:27.098,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Negative.

51
0:02:29.438,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This led to a fantasy.

52
0:02:31.709,000 --> 0:02:36,000
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?

53
0:02:36.955,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,

54
0:02:40.923,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but I decided I would end it at 0.2,

55
0:02:43.717,000 --> 0:02:47,000
just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.

56
0:02:48.542,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown

57
0:02:51.906,000 --> 0:02:55,000
at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,

58
0:02:55.967,000 --> 0:02:58,000
1891 to 2007,

59
0:02:59.155,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.

60
0:03:02.779,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But if growth slows down,

61
0:03:05.084,000 --> 0:03:08,000
instead of doubling our standard of living every generation,

62
0:03:09.067,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,

63
0:03:13.905,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.

64
0:03:16.875,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.

65
0:03:21.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.

66
0:03:24.604,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,

67
0:03:27.18,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we were at about 5,000 dollars.

68
0:03:28.91,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Today we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output

69
0:03:31.815,000 --> 0:03:33,000
per member of the population.

70
0:03:34.482,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now what if we could achieve that historic

71
0:03:36.9,000 --> 0:03:38,000
two-percent growth for the next 70 years?

72
0:03:39.883,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Well, it's a matter of arithmetic.

73
0:03:41.215,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.

74
0:03:45.355,000 --> 0:03:48,000
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.

75
0:03:49.056,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Well, we're not going to do that,

76
0:03:51.507,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and the reason is the headwinds.

77
0:03:53.333,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The first headwind is demographics.

78
0:03:54.974,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's a truism that your standard of living

79
0:03:57.312,000 --> 0:04:,000
rises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,

80
0:04:00.824,000 --> 0:04:02,000
if hours per person increased.

81
0:04:03.434,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s

82
0:04:05.936,000 --> 0:04:07,000
when women entered the labor force.

83
0:04:08.454,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But now it's turned around.

84
0:04:10.691,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now hours per person are shrinking,

85
0:04:12.891,000 --> 0:04:14,000
first because of the retirement of the baby boomers,

86
0:04:15.765,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and second because there's been a very significant

87
0:04:19.919,000 --> 0:04:22,000
dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males

88
0:04:23.916,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.

89
0:04:27.854,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The next headwind is education.

90
0:04:30.015,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We've got problems all over our educational system

91
0:04:32.66,000 --> 0:04:33,000
despite Race to the Top.

92
0:04:34.181,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education

93
0:04:38.263,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.

94
0:04:41.175,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,

95
0:04:45.431,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and our college completion rate

96
0:04:48.418,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.

97
0:04:55.369,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We have a lot of debt.

98
0:04:57.476,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007

99
0:05:02.458,000 --> 0:05:05,000
on the back of consumers massively overborrowing.

100
0:05:05.69,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons

101
0:05:08.626,000 --> 0:05:1,000
why our economic recovery is so sluggish today.

102
0:05:11.362,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And everybody of course knows

103
0:05:12.948,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that the federal government debt is growing

104
0:05:15.077,000 --> 0:05:18,000
as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,

105
0:05:18.406,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the only way that's going to stop is some combination

106
0:05:21.568,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,

107
0:05:26.645,000 --> 0:05:28,000
also called transfer payments.

108
0:05:28.73,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And that gets us down from the 1.5,

109
0:05:30.899,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where we've reached for education, down to 1.3.

110
0:05:34.3,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then we have inequality.

111
0:05:36.718,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Over the 15 years before the financial crisis,

112
0:05:39.471,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent

113
0:05:42.737,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of the income distribution was half a point slower

114
0:05:45.86,000 --> 0:05:47,000
than the averages we've been talking about before.

115
0:05:48.636,000 --> 0:05:5,000
All the rest went to the top one percent.

116
0:05:50.922,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So that brings us down to 0.8.

117
0:05:53.274,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And that 0.8 is the big challenge.

118
0:05:56.649,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Are we going to grow at 0.8?

119
0:05:58.863,000 --> 0:06:,000
If so, that's going to require that our inventions

120
0:06:01.318,000 --> 0:06:03,000
are as important as the ones that happened

121
0:06:03.665,000 --> 0:06:05,000
over the last 150 years.

122
0:06:06.583,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So let's see what some of those inventions were.

123
0:06:10.622,000 --> 0:06:13,000
If you wanted to read in 1875 at night,

124
0:06:14.124,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.

125
0:06:17.446,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They created pollution, they created odors,

126
0:06:19.603,000 --> 0:06:21,000
they were hard to control, the light was dim,

127
0:06:22.008,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and they were a fire hazard.

128
0:06:24.156,000 --> 0:06:29,000
By 1929, electric light was everywhere.

129
0:06:29.251,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.

130
0:06:33.4,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Central Manhattan became possible.

131
0:06:36.385,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And then, in addition to that, at the same time,

132
0:06:39.632,000 --> 0:06:42,000
hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools

133
0:06:43.128,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and hand-powered electric tools,

134
0:06:45.836,000 --> 0:06:47,000
all achieved by electricity.

135
0:06:48.694,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women.

136
0:06:52.907,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Women, back in the late 19th century,

137
0:06:55.595,000 --> 0:06:57,000
spent two days a week doing the laundry.

138
0:06:58.251,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They did it on a scrub board.

139
0:06:59.966,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry.

140
0:07:02.034,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Then they had to bring them in.

141
0:07:03.566,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.

142
0:07:06.519,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And then we had the electric washing machine.

143
0:07:10.106,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And by 1950, they were everywhere.

144
0:07:13.18,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But the women still had to shop every day,

145
0:07:16.208,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but no they didn't, because electricity

146
0:07:18.5,000 --> 0:07:2,000
brought us the electric refrigerator.

147
0:07:21.401,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes

148
0:07:24.593,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.

149
0:07:29.122,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.

150
0:07:31.438,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But by 1929, certainly by 1950,

151
0:07:34.118,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we had central heating everywhere.

152
0:07:38.01,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What about the internal combustion engine,

153
0:07:40.602,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which was invented in 1879?

154
0:07:42.942,000 --> 0:07:45,000
In America, before the motor vehicle,

155
0:07:46.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
transportation depended entirely on the urban horse,

156
0:07:50.732,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which dropped, without restraint,

157
0:07:53.618,000 --> 0:07:56,000
25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day

158
0:07:57.423,000 --> 0:07:58,000
together with a gallon of urine.

159
0:07:59.347,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That comes out at five to 10 tons daily

160
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
per square mile in cities.

161
0:08:04.993,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.

162
0:08:10.934,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's the percentage of American agricultural land

163
0:08:13.332,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it took to feed the horses.

164
0:08:15.525,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented,

165
0:08:19.487,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,

166
0:08:22.691,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that agricultural land could be used for human consumption

167
0:08:25.786,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or for export.

168
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,

169
0:08:30.96,000 --> 0:08:34,000
only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households

170
0:08:35.876,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.

171
0:08:42.46,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Back before the turn of the century,

172
0:08:45.271,000 --> 0:08:46,000
women had another problem.

173
0:08:46.672,000 --> 0:08:5,000
All the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing

174
0:08:51.267,000 --> 0:08:55,000
had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.

175
0:08:55.937,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's a historical fact that in 1885,

176
0:08:58.412,000 --> 0:09:,000
the average North Carolina housewife

177
0:09:00.726,000 --> 0:09:05,000
walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.

178
0:09:06.096,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But by 1929, cities around the country

179
0:09:10.5,000 --> 0:09:13,000
had put in underground water pipes.

180
0:09:13.515,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They had put in underground sewer pipes,

181
0:09:16.941,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,

182
0:09:22.123,000 --> 0:09:26,000
waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.

183
0:09:26.369,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And an amazing fact for techno-optimists

184
0:09:29.971,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is that in the first half of the 20th century,

185
0:09:32.543,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the rate of improvement of life expectancy

186
0:09:35.255,000 --> 0:09:37,000
was three times faster than it was

187
0:09:38.056,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in the second half of the 19th century.

188
0:09:40.927,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.

189
0:09:46.013,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And I'll just give you a few examples.

190
0:09:48.195,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.

191
0:09:51.463,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,

192
0:09:55.071,000 --> 0:09:57,000
they all went from zero to 100 percent.

193
0:09:57.434,000 --> 0:10:,000
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm.

194
0:10:01.084,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent

195
0:10:03.926,000 --> 0:10:07,000
by the early postwar years.

196
0:10:08.054,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What about the electronic revolution?

197
0:10:10.297,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Here's an early computer.

198
0:10:12.418,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.

199
0:10:15.728,000 --> 0:10:19,000
By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements

200
0:10:20.281,000 --> 0:10:21,000
were being produced by computers.

201
0:10:22.052,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers

202
0:10:24.916,000 --> 0:10:26,000
were invented in the 1970s.

203
0:10:27.831,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,

204
0:10:31.086,000 --> 0:10:33,000
ATM machines to replace bank tellers,

205
0:10:33.871,000 --> 0:10:36,000
bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.

206
0:10:37.764,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Fast forward through the '90s,

207
0:10:39.631,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we had the dotcom revolution

208
0:10:41.199,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and a temporary rise in productivity growth.

209
0:10:44.323,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But I'm now going to give you an experiment.

210
0:10:46.775,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You have to choose either option A or option B.

211
0:10:49.863,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:52.378,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.

213
0:10:55.719,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So you get Google, you get Amazon,

214
0:10:58.629,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.

215
0:11:01.716,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Or you get everything invented to yesterday,

216
0:11:03.545,000 --> 0:11:05,000
including Facebook and your iPhone,

217
0:11:05.621,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,

218
0:11:07.98,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and carry in the water.

219
0:11:10.844,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,

220
0:11:14.294,000 --> 0:11:15,000
maybe for a couple of days,

221
0:11:15.817,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in some cases for more than a week,

222
0:11:17.943,000 --> 0:11:2,000
electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,

223
0:11:21.483,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and a charge for their iPhones.

224
0:11:24.399,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The problem we face is that all these great inventions,

225
0:11:27.91,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we have to match them in the future,

226
0:11:30.914,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and my prediction that we're not going to match them

227
0:11:33.502,000 --> 0:11:36,000
brings us down from the original two-percent growth

228
0:11:36.697,000 --> 0:11:41,000
down to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.

229
0:11:41.767,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So here we are back to the horse and buggy.

230
0:11:44.774,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'd like to award an Oscar

231
0:11:47.095,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to the inventors of the 20th century,

232
0:11:50.748,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the people from Alexander Graham Bell

233
0:11:53.489,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,

234
0:11:55.192,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I'd like to call them all up here,

235
0:11:56.915,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and they're going to call back to you.

236
0:11:58.785,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved?

237
0:12:02.448,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Thank you.

238
0:12:03.982,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Applause)

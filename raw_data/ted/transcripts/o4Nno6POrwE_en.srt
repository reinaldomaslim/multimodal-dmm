2
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was a new mother

3
0:00:15.2,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and a young rabbi

4
0:00:16.48,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in the spring of 2004

5
0:00:18.36,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and the world was in shambles.

6
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Maybe you remember.

7
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Every day, we heard devastating reports from the war in Iraq.

8
0:00:25.68,000 --> 0:00:28,000
There were waves of terror rolling across the globe.

9
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It seemed like humanity was spinning out of control.

10
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I remember the night that I read

11
0:00:34.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
about the series of coordinated bombings

12
0:00:37.04,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in the subway system in Madrid,

13
0:00:39.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I got up and I walked over to the crib

14
0:00:41.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
where my six-month-old baby girl

15
0:00:44.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
lay sleeping sweetly,

16
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I heard the rhythm of her breath,

17
0:00:48.52,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body.

18
0:00:52.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies,

19
0:00:56.2,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in politics, in religion, in populations.

20
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
Everything felt so precarious.

21
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I remember thinking,

22
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"My God, what kind of world did we bring this child into?

23
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And what was I as a mother and a religious leader

24
0:01:10.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
willing to do about it?

25
0:01:14.84,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Of course, I knew it was clear

26
0:01:17.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that religion would be a principle battlefield

27
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in this rapidly changing landscape,

28
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it was already clear

29
0:01:24.76,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that religion was a significant part of the problem.

30
0:01:28.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The question for me was,

31
0:01:29.4,000 --> 0:01:31,000
could religion also be part of the solution?

32
0:01:32.48,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, throughout history,

33
0:01:34.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities

34
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in the name of religion.

35
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And as we entered the 21st century,

36
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it was very clear that religious extremism was once again on the rise.

37
0:01:47.76,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Our studies now show

38
0:01:49.04,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that over the course of the past 15, 20 years,

39
0:01:52.32,000 --> 0:01:54,000
hostilities and religion-related violence

40
0:01:54.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
have been on the increase all over the world.

41
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But we don't even need the studies to prove it,

42
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because I ask you, how many of us are surprised today

43
0:02:02.92,000 --> 0:02:05,000
when we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting,

44
0:02:06.72,000 --> 0:02:08,000
when we later find out that the last word that was uttered

45
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:11,000
before the trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated

46
0:02:12.4,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is the name of God?

47
0:02:14.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It barely raises an eyebrow today

48
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
when we learn that yet another person

49
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:2,000
has decided to show his love of God

50
0:02:21.24,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by taking the lives of God's children.

51
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In America, religious extremism

52
0:02:27.12,000 --> 0:02:31,000
looks like a white, antiabortion Christian extremist

53
0:02:31.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
walking into Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs

54
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and murdering three people.

55
0:02:36.8,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It also looks like a couple

56
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:4,000
inspired by the Islamic State

57
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:44,000
walking into an office party in San Bernardino and killing 14.

58
0:02:45.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And even when religion-related extremism does not lead to violence,

59
0:02:50.4,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it is still used as a political wedge issue,

60
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
cynically leading people to justify the subordination of women,

61
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the stigmatization of LGBT people,

62
0:03:00.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

63
0:03:04.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This ought to concern deeply

64
0:03:06.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
those of us who care about the future of religion

65
0:03:09.4,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and the future of faith.

66
0:03:11.64,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We need to call this what it is:

67
0:03:14.04,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a great failure of religion.

68
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But the thing is, this isn't even the only challenge that religion faces today.

69
0:03:24.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
At the very same time

70
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that we need religion to be a strong force against extremism,

71
0:03:29.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it is suffering from a second pernicious trend,

72
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what I call religious routine-ism.

73
0:03:35.84,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is when our institutions and our leaders

74
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory,

75
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
devoid of life, devoid of vision

76
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and devoid of soul.

77
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Let me explain what I mean like this.

78
0:03:48.92,000 --> 0:03:5,000
One of the great blessings of being a rabbi

79
0:03:51.72,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is standing under the chuppah, under the wedding canopy, with a couple,

80
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and helping them proclaim publicly

81
0:03:58.68,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and make holy the love that they found for one another.

82
0:04:01.96,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I want to ask you now, though,

83
0:04:03.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to think maybe from your own experience

84
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or maybe just imagine it

85
0:04:07.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
about the difference between the intensity of the experience

86
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:11,000
under the wedding canopy,

87
0:04:11.96,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary.

88
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:17.68,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And if you're lucky enough to make it 16 or 17 years,

90
0:04:21.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
if you're like most people, you probably wake up in the morning

91
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
realizing that you forgot to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant

92
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and you forgot so much as a card,

93
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot.

94
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Well, religious ritual and rites

95
0:04:36.6,000 --> 0:04:39,000
were essentially designed to serve the function of the anniversary,

96
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants

97
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of that sacred, revelatory encounter

98
0:04:47.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that birthed the religion in the first place.

99
0:04:49.24,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The problem is that after a few centuries,

100
0:04:51.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the date remains on the calendar,

101
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but the love affair is long dead.

102
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That's when we find ourselves in endless, mindless repetitions

103
0:05:01.88,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of words that don't mean anything to us,

104
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
rising and being seated because someone has asked us to,

105
0:05:07.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
holding onto jealously guarded doctrine

106
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality,

107
0:05:14.68,000 --> 0:05:16,000
engaging in perfunctory practice

108
0:05:17.24,000 --> 0:05:2,000
simply because that's the way things have always been done.

109
0:05:22.08,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Religion is waning in the United States.

110
0:05:25.6,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Across the board, churches and synagogues and mosques

111
0:05:29.56,000 --> 0:05:3,000
are all complaining

112
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:35,000
about how hard it is to maintain relevance

113
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
for a generation of young people who seem completely uninterested,

114
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
not only in the institutions that stand at the heart of our traditions

115
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but even in religion itself.

116
0:05:46.44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And what they need to understand

117
0:05:49.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is that there is today a generation of people

118
0:05:52.04,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who are as disgusted by the violence of religious extremism

119
0:05:55.92,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as they are turned off

120
0:05:57.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
by the lifelessness of religious routine-ism.

121
0:06:02.44,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Of course there is a bright spot to this story.

122
0:06:06.96,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Given the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life,

123
0:06:11.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
about 12 or 13 years ago, I set out to try to determine

124
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if there was any way

125
0:06:16.56,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that I could reclaim the heart of my own Jewish tradition,

126
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to help make it meaningful and purposeful again

127
0:06:23.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in a world on fire.

128
0:06:25.52,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I started to wonder,

129
0:06:26.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
what if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation

130
0:06:31.12,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again

131
0:06:35.12,000 --> 0:06:38,000
about what the next iteration of religious life would look like?

132
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now, we had no money, no space, no game plan,

133
0:06:41.32,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but we did have email.

134
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email

135
0:06:46.52,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues.

136
0:06:49.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It basically said this:

137
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"Before you bail on religion,

138
0:06:54.44,000 --> 0:06:56,000
why don't we come together this Friday night

139
0:06:56.64,000 --> 0:07:,000
and see what we might make of our own Jewish inheritance?"

140
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.

141
0:07:03.92,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It turned out 135 people came.

142
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They were cynics and seekers,

143
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
atheists and rabbis.

144
0:07:11.32,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Many people said that night that it was the first time

145
0:07:13.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives.

146
0:07:18.2,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And so I set out to do the only rational thing

147
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that someone would do in such a circumstance:

148
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I quit my job and tried to build this audacious dream,

149
0:07:27.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a reinvented, rethought religious life

150
0:07:31.52,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which we called "IKAR,"

151
0:07:33.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which means "the essence" or "the heart of the matter."

152
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, IKAR is not alone

153
0:07:39.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
out there in the religious landscape today.

154
0:07:41.64,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There are Jewish and Christian and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,

155
0:07:45.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
many of them women, by the way,

156
0:07:47.8,000 --> 0:07:51,000
who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions,

157
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:56,000
who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution.

158
0:07:57.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We are going back into our sacred traditions

159
0:08:00.08,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and recognizing that all of our traditions

160
0:08:02.84,000 --> 0:08:06,000
contain the raw material to justify violence and extremism,

161
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and also contain the raw material to justify compassion,

162
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
coexistence and kindness --

163
0:08:14.44,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance,

164
0:08:19.28,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we can choose to read those same texts

165
0:08:21.92,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as directives for love and for forgiveness.

166
0:08:26.12,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I have found now

167
0:08:27.64,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in communities as varied as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts

168
0:08:32.88,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to a woman's mosque,

169
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to black churches in New York and in North Carolina,

170
0:08:38.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to a holy bus loaded with nuns

171
0:08:40.8,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that traverses this country with a message of justice and peace,

172
0:08:45.039,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that there is a shared religious ethos

173
0:08:47.919,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that is now emerging in the form of revitalized religion in this country.

174
0:08:53.6,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And while the theologies and the practices vary very much

175
0:08:57.76,000 --> 0:08:59,000
between these independent communities,

176
0:09:00.48,000 --> 0:09:03,000
what we can see are some common, consistent threads between them.

177
0:09:03.92,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm going to share with you four of those commitments now.

178
0:09:07.8,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The first is wakefulness.

179
0:09:10.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We live in a time today

180
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in which we have unprecedented access

181
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to information about every global tragedy

182
0:09:17.4,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that happens on every corner of this Earth.

183
0:09:19.88,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Within 12 hours, 20 million people

184
0:09:22.6,000 --> 0:09:24,000
saw that image of Aylan Kurdi's little body

185
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:27,000
washed up on the Turkish shore.

186
0:09:27.6,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We all saw this picture.

187
0:09:30.92,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We saw this picture of a five-year-old child

188
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
pulled out of the rubble of his building in Aleppo.

189
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And once we see these images,

190
0:09:39.56,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we are called to a certain kind of action.

191
0:09:42.52,000 --> 0:09:46,000
My tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road

192
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when he sees a beautiful house on fire,

193
0:09:50.52,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and he says, "How can it be that something so beautiful would burn,

194
0:09:54.08,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and nobody seems to even care?"

195
0:09:56.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So too we learn that our world is on fire,

196
0:09:59.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and it is our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open,

197
0:10:03.52,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to recognize that it's our responsibility

198
0:10:06.08,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to help put out the flames.

199
0:10:08.68,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is extremely difficult to do.

200
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what's broken in our world,

201
0:10:14.56,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the less likely we are to do anything.

202
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's called psychic numbing.

203
0:10:18.52,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We just shut down at a certain point.

204
0:10:21.52,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Well, somewhere along the way, our religious leaders forgot

205
0:10:25.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that it's our job to make people uncomfortable.

206
0:10:28.92,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's our job to wake people up,

207
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to pull them out of their apathy

208
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and into the anguish,

209
0:10:34.64,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and to insist that we do what we don't want to do

210
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and see what we do not want to see.

211
0:10:41.48,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Because we know that social change only happens --

212
0:10:43.88,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

213
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:47,000
when we are awake enough to see that the house is on fire.

214
0:10:49.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The second principle is hope,

215
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I want to say this about hope.

216
0:10:53.364,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Hope is not naive,

217
0:10:55.52,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and hope is not an opiate.

218
0:10:57.48,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Hope may be the single greatest act of defiance

219
0:11:01.56,000 --> 0:11:03,000
against a politics of pessimism

220
0:11:03.92,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and against a culture of despair.

221
0:11:06.36,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Because what hope does for us

222
0:11:08.28,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is it lifts us out of the container

223
0:11:11.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that holds us and constrains us from the outside,

224
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and says, "You can dream and think expansively again.

225
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That they cannot control in you."

226
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I saw hope made manifest in an African-American church

227
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in the South Side of Chicago this summer,

228
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:28,000
where I brought my little girl,

229
0:11:29.04,000 --> 0:11:3,000
who is now 13

230
0:11:30.28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and a few inches taller than me,

231
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.

232
0:11:35.56,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That summer, there had already been 3,000 people shot

233
0:11:41.08,000 --> 0:11:44,000
between January and July in Chicago.

234
0:11:45.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We went into that church and heard Rev. Moss preach,

235
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and after he did,

236
0:11:50.12,000 --> 0:11:54,000
this choir of gorgeous women, 100 women strong,

237
0:11:54.4,000 --> 0:11:55,000
stood up and began to sing.

238
0:11:57.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
"I need you. You need me.

239
0:12:00.36,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I love you. I need you to survive."

240
0:12:03.72,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And I realized in that moment

241
0:12:05.44,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that this is what religion is supposed to be about.

242
0:12:09.04,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's supposed to be about giving people back a sense of purpose,

243
0:12:13.76,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a sense of hope,

244
0:12:15.28,000 --> 0:12:19,000
a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world

245
0:12:20.24,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that tells them that they don't matter at all.

246
0:12:23.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The third principle is the principle of mightiness.

247
0:12:26.56,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around

248
0:12:29.24,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with two slips of paper in our pockets.

249
0:12:31.56,000 --> 0:12:34,000
One says, "I am but dust and ashes."

250
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's not all about me.

251
0:12:36.72,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I can't control everything, and I cannot do this on my own.

252
0:12:40.96,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The other slip of paper says, "For my sake the world was created."

253
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Which is to say it's true that I can't do everything,

254
0:12:49.04,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but I can surely do something.

255
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I can forgive.

256
0:12:53.84,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I can love.

257
0:12:55.56,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I can show up.

258
0:12:57.08,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I can protest.

259
0:12:58.72,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I can be a part of this conversation.

260
0:13:01.92,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We even now have a religious ritual,

261
0:13:04.8,000 --> 0:13:05,000
a posture,

262
0:13:06.04,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that holds the paradox between powerlessness and power.

263
0:13:09.76,000 --> 0:13:1,000
In the Jewish community,

264
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the only time of year that we prostrate fully to the ground

265
0:13:14.32,000 --> 0:13:15,000
is during the high holy days.

266
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It's a sign of total submission.

267
0:13:18.84,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now in our community, when we get up off the ground,

268
0:13:21.92,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we stand with our hands raised to the heavens,

269
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and we say, "I am strong, I am mighty, and I am worthy.

270
0:13:31.08,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I can't do everything, but I can do something."

271
0:13:35.72,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In a world that conspires to make us believe that we are invisible

272
0:13:40.64,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and that we are impotent,

273
0:13:42.2,000 --> 0:13:44,000
religious communities and religious ritual

274
0:13:44.96,000 --> 0:13:47,000
can remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this Earth,

275
0:13:48.6,000 --> 0:13:5,000
whatever gifts and blessings we were given,

276
0:13:51.08,000 --> 0:13:52,000
whatever resources we have,

277
0:13:52.84,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we can and we must use them

278
0:13:55.2,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to try to make the world a little bit more just

279
0:13:57.8,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and a little bit more loving.

280
0:13:59.92,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The fourth and final is interconnectedness.

281
0:14:02.88,000 --> 0:14:05,000
A few years ago, there was a man walking on the beach in Alaska,

282
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
when he came across a soccer ball

283
0:14:08.12,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that had some Japanese letters written on it.

284
0:14:10.64,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He took a picture of it and posted it up on social media,

285
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and a Japanese teenager contacted him.

286
0:14:16.72,000 --> 0:14:19,000
He had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country,

287
0:14:20.52,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but he was able to retrieve that soccer ball

288
0:14:23.24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
after it had floated all the way across the Pacific.

289
0:14:26.28,000 --> 0:14:28,000
How small our world has become.

290
0:14:29.08,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are

291
0:14:33.92,000 --> 0:14:34,000
as human beings.

292
0:14:36.72,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And yet, we know

293
0:14:38.72,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that it is systems of oppression

294
0:14:41.44,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism.

295
0:14:45.56,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Let me tell you how this works.

296
0:14:47.4,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I'm not supposed to care

297
0:14:49.36,000 --> 0:14:51,000
when black youth are harassed by police,

298
0:14:51.84,000 --> 0:14:53,000
because my white-looking Jewish kids

299
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
probably won't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black.

300
0:14:58.08,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Well, not so, because this is also my problem.

301
0:15:02.12,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And guess what? Transphobia and Islamophobia

302
0:15:05.32,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and racism of all forms, those are also all of our problems.

303
0:15:08.88,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And so too is anti-Semitism all of our problems.

304
0:15:12.36,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Because Emma Lazarus was right.

305
0:15:14.08,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

306
0:15:19.56,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Emma Lazarus was right when she said until all of us are free,

307
0:15:22.92,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we are none of us free.

308
0:15:24.88,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We are all in this together.

309
0:15:27.8,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends,

310
0:15:31.32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
of wakefulness and hope and mightiness and interconnectedness,

311
0:15:36.08,000 --> 0:15:4,000
there is a burgeoning, multifaith justice movement in this country

312
0:15:40.64,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that is staking a claim on a countertrend,

313
0:15:42.92,000 --> 0:15:47,000
saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world.

314
0:15:48.08,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Our hearts hurt from the failed religion of extremism,

315
0:15:52.12,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine-ism.

316
0:15:56.36,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It is time for religious leaders and religious communities

317
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift

318
0:16:03.56,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that this country and the world so desperately needs --

319
0:16:07.28,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a shift toward love,

320
0:16:09.44,000 --> 0:16:12,000
toward justice, toward equality and toward dignity for all.

321

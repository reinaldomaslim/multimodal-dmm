1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I see my life as a series of experiments.

5
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,

6
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"

7
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,

8
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to live my life for me.

9
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So, they answered my emails.

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They answered my phone.

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.

12
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was the best month of my life,

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.

14
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It was a wonderful experience.

15
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --

16
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
about radical honesty.

17
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this is a movement where --

18
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,

19
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who says that you should never, ever lie,

20
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.

21
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain

22
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
should come out of your mouth.

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, I decided I would try this for a month.

24
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This was the worst month of my life.

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I do not recommend this at all.

27
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
To give you a sense of the experience,

28
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."

29
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, that was hard.

31
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica

33
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,

34
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,

35
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.

36
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.

38
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But I love that one,

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because that was an experiment about how much information

40
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
one human brain could absorb.

41
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.

42
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You can just Google it.

43
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, I wasted some time there.

44
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I love those experiments,

45
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but I think that the most profound

46
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and life-changing experiment that I've done

47
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year

48
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,

49
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"The Year of Living Biblically."

50
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I undertook this for two reasons.

51
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

52
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the Olive Garden is Italian.

54
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, not very.

56
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But I've become increasingly interested in religion.

57
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I do think it's the defining issue of our time,

58
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or one of the main ones.

59
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.

60
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.

61
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The second reason I undertook this is because

62
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,

63
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
religious fundamentalism, and people who say

64
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,

65
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.

66
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?

67
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion

68
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and take everything in the Bible literally,

69
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
without picking and choosing.

70
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.

71
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I had Christian bibles.

72
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
I had Jewish bibles.

73
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,

74
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"

75
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."

76
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Then I went down and I read several versions,

77
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and I wrote down every single law that I could find.

78
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.

79
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --

80
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.

81
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I wanted to follow those.

82
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And actually, I take my projects very seriously,

83
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because I had twins during my year,

84
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so I definitely take my projects seriously.

85
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds

86
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.

87
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
There is the law in Leviticus,

88
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."

89
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I didn't know where my corners were,

90
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so I decided to let the whole thing grow,

91
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and this is what I looked like by the end.

92
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.

93
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

94
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.

95
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So, certainly the challenge was there.

96
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,

97
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."

98
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You only know if you try it.

99
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.

100
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,

101
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,

102
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
then her hand shall be cut off.

103
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So, I wanted to follow that rule.

104
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
That one I followed by default,

106
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,

107
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
looking like she had a strong grip.

108
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.

110
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I will say it was an amazing year

111
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.

112
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.

113
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.

114
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
You know, I could spend a year not killing,

115
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --

116
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,

117
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.

118
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,

119
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because I couldn't believe how much

120
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
my behavior changed my thoughts.

121
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This was one of the huge lessons of the year,

122
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is that I almost pretended to be a better person,

123
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and I became a little bit of a better person.

124
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,

125
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.

126
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.

127
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,

128
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you visit sick people in the hospital,

129
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and you will become more compassionate.

130
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You donate money to a cause,

131
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and you become emotionally involved in that cause.

132
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So, it really was cognitive psychology --

133
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.

134
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,

135
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
very primitive cognitive psychology.

136
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,

137
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which, as we know, is actually true.

138
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey

139
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
was the rules that will get you into a little trouble

140
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in twenty-first-century America.

141
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.

142
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But it's a big part of the Bible,

144
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so I figured I had to address it.

145
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So, I was able to stone one adulterer.

146
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,

147
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so sandals and sort of a white robe,

148
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.

149
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.

150
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And this man came up to me and he said,

151
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"Why are you dressed like that?"

152
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And I explained my project,

153
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"

154
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I said, "Well, that would be great!"

155
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

156
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket

157
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that I had been carrying around for weeks,

158
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --

159
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but he grabbed them out of my hand.

160
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.

161
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.

162
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He grabbed them out of my hand

163
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --

164
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.

165
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me

166
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.

167
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,

168
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and yet so incredibly wise in others?

169
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
How should we view the Bible?

170
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Should we view it, you know, as original intent,

171
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?

172
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
How was the Bible written?

173
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And actually, since this is a tech crowd,

174
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me

175
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors

176
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
over hundreds of years.

177
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it's sort of evolved.

178
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.

179
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So I thought I would end by telling you

180
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons

181
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that I learned from my year.

182
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.

183
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
This became very, very clear, early on.

184
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,

185
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.

186
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.

187
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

189
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women

190
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
during certain times of the month, and more than that,

191
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.

192
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And my wife thought this was very offensive,

193
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
so she sat in every seat in our apartment,

194
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I had to spend much of the year standing

195
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
until I bought my own seat and carried it around.

196
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So, you know, I met with creationists.

197
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I went to the creationists' museum.

198
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And these are the ultimate literalists.

199
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.

200
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.

201
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's just that their faith is so strong

202
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in this literal interpretation of the Bible

203
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that they distort all the data to fit their model.

204
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.

205
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.

206
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
They really did a fantastic job.

207
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If you're ever in Kentucky,

208
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there's, you can see a movie of the flood,

209
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and they have sprinklers in the ceiling

210
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.

211
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --

212
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they did a great job.

213
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

214
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.

215
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,

216
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.

217
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,

218
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and I started to change my perspective.

219
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things

220
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that go right every day, that I didn't even notice,

221
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing

222
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
on the three or four that went wrong.

223
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,

224
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
is to just remember when I came over here,

225
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.

226
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's a remarkable thing.

227
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Third, that thou shall have reverence.

228
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This one was unexpected because I started the year

229
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
as an agnostic, and by the end of the year,

230
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.

231
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I'm trying to start it as a movement.

232
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So, if anyone wants to join,

233
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,

234
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,

235
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and that our rituals can be sacred.

236
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The Sabbath can be sacred.

237
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,

238
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because I am a workaholic, so having this one day

239
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.

240
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.

241
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thou shall not stereotype.

242
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This one happened because

243
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I spent a lot of time with various religious communities

244
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
throughout America because I wanted it to be more

245
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
than about my journey.

246
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I wanted it to be about religion in America.

247
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.

248
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I'm very proud because

249
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I think I'm the only person in America

250
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.

251
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

252
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,

253
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
he's like, "I gotta go."

254
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

255
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Oh, thank you very much.

256
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Thank you. Bless you, bless you.

257
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But it was interesting

258
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,

259
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
evangelical Christianity, and I found that

260
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
it's such a wide and varied movement

261
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.

262
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,

263
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and they focus on the red words in the Bible,

264
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
which are the ones that Jesus spoke.

265
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.

266
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.

267
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
They have a pamphlet that says,

268
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"

269
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.

270
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,

271
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
helping poor people.

272
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So, this was very inspiring to me.

273
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.

274
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree

275
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
with much of what they say.

276
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.

277
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This one was very unexpected because, you know,

278
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I grew up with the scientific worldview,

279
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and I was shocked learning how much of my life

280
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is governed by irrational forces.

281
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And the thing is, if they're not harmful,

282
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
they're not to be completely dismissed.

283
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was

284
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,

285
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people

286
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"

287
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And they said, "We don't know,

288
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but it's just rituals that give us meaning."

289
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I would say, "But that's crazy."

290
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And they would say, "Well, what about you?

291
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.

292
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy

293
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
blowing out the fire on top of a cake

294
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,

295
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,

296
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but that guy's crazy?'"

297
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.

298
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So the key is to choose the right rituals,

299
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves

300
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
are not to be dismissed.

301
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.

302
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And this one I learned because

303
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I tried to follow everything in the Bible.

304
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And I failed miserably.

305
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Because you can't.

306
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible

307
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is going to be picking and choosing.

308
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.

309
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,

310
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,

311
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.

312
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
You're just picking and choosing."

313
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"

314
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I've had some great meals at cafeterias.

315
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.

316
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,

317
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,

318
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,

319
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
or intolerance, or violence,

320
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
which are very much in the Bible as well.

321
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So if we are to find any meaning in this book,

322
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.

323
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.

324
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
There's me reading the Bible.

325
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
That's how I hailed taxicabs.

326
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
(Laughter)

327
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Seriously, and it worked. And yes,

328
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that was actually a rented sheep,

329
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.

330
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.

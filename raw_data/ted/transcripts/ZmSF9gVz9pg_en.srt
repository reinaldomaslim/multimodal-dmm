2
0:00:12.532,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Let's talk dirty.

3
0:00:16.644,000 --> 0:00:18,000
A few years ago, oddly enough,

4
0:00:19.38,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I needed the bathroom,

5
0:00:22.114,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I found one, a public bathroom,

6
0:00:25.464,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I went into the stall,

7
0:00:27.828,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:

8
0:00:31.125,000 --> 0:00:35,000
use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.

9
0:00:35.667,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And for some reason that day, instead,

10
0:00:37.748,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I asked myself a question,

11
0:00:39.932,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and it was, where does this stuff go?

12
0:00:43.808,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And with that question, I found myself plunged

13
0:00:47.7,000 --> 0:00:51,000
into the world of sanitation --

14
0:00:51.724,000 --> 0:00:52,000
there's more coming -- (Laughter) —

15
0:00:53.289,000 --> 0:00:57,000
sanitation, toilets and poop,

16
0:00:57.858,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I have yet to emerge.

17
0:01:00.931,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And that's because it's such an enraging,

18
0:01:03.236,000 --> 0:01:06,000
yet engaging place to be.

19
0:01:06.452,000 --> 0:01:09,000
To go back to that toilet,

20
0:01:09.708,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,

21
0:01:12.502,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it wasn't as nice as this one

22
0:01:13.937,000 --> 0:01:15,000
from the World Toilet Organization.

23
0:01:16.868,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That's the other WTO. (Laughter)

24
0:01:21.135,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,

25
0:01:24.749,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it had soap so I could wash my hands,

26
0:01:27.013,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.

27
0:01:30.077,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

28
0:01:35.685,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But that day, when I asked that question,

29
0:01:38.096,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking

30
0:01:40.829,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that a toilet like that was my right,

31
0:01:43.044,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when in fact it's a privilege.

32
0:01:46.222,000 --> 0:01:51,000
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.

33
0:01:51.481,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They don't have a bucket or a box.

34
0:01:55.421,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.

35
0:01:59.629,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And they have to do what this little boy is doing

36
0:02:02.126,000 --> 0:02:04,000
by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,

37
0:02:05.061,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which is called open defecation,

38
0:02:07.709,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or poo-pooing in the open.

39
0:02:11.064,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And he does that every day,

40
0:02:13.298,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and every day, probably, that guy in the picture

41
0:02:15.797,000 --> 0:02:16,000
walks on by,

42
0:02:17.651,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.

43
0:02:21.109,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But he should, because the problem

44
0:02:23.229,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with all that poop lying around

45
0:02:25.589,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is that poop carries passengers.

46
0:02:28.597,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.

47
0:02:32.896,000 --> 0:02:34,000
All those things, the eggs, the cysts,

48
0:02:35.317,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel

49
0:02:38.093,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in one gram of human feces.

50
0:02:41.501,000 --> 0:02:44,000
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.

51
0:02:45.213,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,

52
0:02:47.709,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food

53
0:02:51.364,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and his environment

54
0:02:52.768,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with whatever diseases he may be carrying

55
0:02:55.165,000 --> 0:03:,000
by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.

56
0:03:00.914,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world

57
0:03:03.186,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that most of us in this room are lucky to live in,

58
0:03:05.813,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the most common symptoms associated with those diseases,

59
0:03:08.862,000 --> 0:03:1,000
diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.

60
0:03:11.688,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.

61
0:03:15.379,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,

62
0:03:17.229,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as a legacy of empire.

63
0:03:19.837,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea

64
0:03:23.577,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in a leading photo image agency,

65
0:03:26.368,000 --> 0:03:28,000
this is the picture that you come up with.

66
0:03:28.388,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:30.253,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Still not sure about the bikini.

68
0:03:35.432,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And here's another image of diarrhea.

69
0:03:37.928,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.

70
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You can't see her, because she's buried

71
0:03:42.839,000 --> 0:03:45,000
under that green grass in a little village in Liberia,

72
0:03:46.122,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because she died in three days from diarrhea --

73
0:03:49.684,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.

74
0:03:53.313,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And that's her dad.

75
0:03:55.792,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But she wasn't alone that day,

76
0:03:57.354,000 --> 0:04:,000
because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,

77
0:04:01.154,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and they do every day.

78
0:04:03.824,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,

79
0:04:08.823,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you've probably been asked to care about things

80
0:04:11.495,000 --> 0:04:14,000
like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,

81
0:04:14.656,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but diarrhea kills more children

82
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
than all those three things put together.

83
0:04:19.712,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.

84
0:04:24.054,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And the cost to the world is immense:

85
0:04:27.202,000 --> 0:04:29,000
260 billion dollars lost every year

86
0:04:29.691,000 --> 0:04:31,000
on the losses to poor sanitation.

87
0:04:32.684,000 --> 0:04:33,000
These are cholera beds in Haiti.

88
0:04:34.365,000 --> 0:04:37,000
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.

89
0:04:37.864,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding

90
0:04:40.048,000 --> 0:04:43,000
given to any of those other diseases.

91
0:04:43.764,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But we know how to fix this.

92
0:04:46.176,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We know, because in the mid-19th century,

93
0:04:49.696,000 --> 0:04:51,000
wonderful Victorian engineers

94
0:04:52.085,000 --> 0:04:54,000
installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment

95
0:04:54.888,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.

96
0:04:59.599,000 --> 0:05:,000
Child mortality dropped by the most

97
0:05:01.508,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it had ever dropped in history.

98
0:05:03.698,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance

99
0:05:06.644,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,

100
0:05:09.824,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,

101
0:05:12.667,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and surgery.

102
0:05:14.075,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.

103
0:05:16.796,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell,

104
0:05:20.414,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door —

105
0:05:23.193,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.

106
0:05:26.197,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We don't have a neutral word for it.

107
0:05:27.852,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Poop's not particularly adequate.

108
0:05:29.795,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.

109
0:05:33.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Because I can't explain otherwise,

110
0:05:36.112,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when I look at the figures, what's going on.

111
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,

112
0:05:42.254,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but if you look at the budgets of countries,

113
0:05:44.584,000 --> 0:05:46,000
developing and developed,

114
0:05:46.905,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you'll think there's something wrong with the math,

115
0:05:49.456,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because you'll expect absurdities like

116
0:05:52.282,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military

117
0:05:55.164,000 --> 0:05:57,000
than it does on water and sanitation,

118
0:05:57.445,000 --> 0:05:59,000
even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea

119
0:06:00.253,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in Pakistan every year.

120
0:06:02.352,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But then you look at that already minuscule

121
0:06:04.312,000 --> 0:06:05,000
water and sanitation budget,

122
0:06:06.206,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,

123
0:06:09.69,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is great; we all need water.

124
0:06:11.643,000 --> 0:06:13,000
No one's going to refuse clean water.

125
0:06:13.95,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet,

126
0:06:16.901,000 --> 0:06:18,000
reduces disease by twice as much

127
0:06:19.01,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as just putting in clean water.

128
0:06:21.434,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Think about it. That little boy

129
0:06:22.745,000 --> 0:06:23,000
who's running back into his house,

130
0:06:24.6,000 --> 0:06:26,000
he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,

131
0:06:26.71,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.

132
0:06:31.17,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I think that the real waste of human waste

133
0:06:34.674,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is that we are wasting it as a resource

134
0:06:37.442,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and as an incredible trigger for development,

135
0:06:41.202,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because these are a few things that toilets

136
0:06:43.352,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and poop itself can do for us.

137
0:06:46.282,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.

138
0:06:49.458,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school

139
0:06:52.29,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because they have no adequate sanitation.

140
0:06:55.808,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They've been used to sitting through lessons

141
0:06:57.573,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for years and years holding it in.

142
0:07:00.49,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We've all done that, but they do it every day,

143
0:07:03.25,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,

144
0:07:05.806,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it just gets too much.

145
0:07:08.149,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And I understand that. Who can blame them?

146
0:07:11.69,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So if you met an educationalist and said,

147
0:07:13.616,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent

148
0:07:16.49,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with just one simple thing,"

149
0:07:18.688,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you'd make a lot of friends in education.

150
0:07:21.501,000 --> 0:07:23,000
That's not the only thing it can do for you.

151
0:07:24.036,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Poop can cook your dinner.

152
0:07:27.096,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's got nutrients in it.

153
0:07:28.79,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.

154
0:07:31.251,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We don't keep them all.

155
0:07:33.103,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In Rwanda, they are now getting

156
0:07:35.73,000 --> 0:07:37,000
75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system

157
0:07:38.574,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from the contents of prisoners' bowels.

158
0:07:41.936,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.

159
0:07:45.722,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They're genocidal inmates, most of them,

160
0:07:47.874,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,

161
0:07:51.522,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,

162
0:07:54.833,000 --> 0:07:55,000
pretty much like a stomach,

163
0:07:56.589,000 --> 0:07:58,000
then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,

164
0:07:59.402,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and you can cook with it.

165
0:08:01.427,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And you might think it's just good karma

166
0:08:03.57,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to see these guys stirring shit,

167
0:08:06.042,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but it's also good economic sense,

168
0:08:08.342,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because they're saving a million dollars a year.

169
0:08:10.408,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They're cutting down on deforestation,

170
0:08:12.414,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,

171
0:08:15.317,000 --> 0:08:19,000
infinite and free at the point of production.

172
0:08:20.059,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.

173
0:08:23.407,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose

174
0:08:25.559,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the brown stuff in those syringes,

175
0:08:27.312,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which is what you think it is,

176
0:08:29.248,000 --> 0:08:32,000
except not quite, because it's actually donated.

177
0:08:32.292,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There is now a new career path called stool donor.

178
0:08:35.174,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's like the new sperm donor.

179
0:08:36.994,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,

180
0:08:39.987,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.

181
0:08:43.431,000 --> 0:08:44,000
She's been suffering for years.

182
0:08:44.943,000 --> 0:08:47,000
She gets a dose of healthy human feces,

183
0:08:48.035,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.

184
0:08:52.516,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.

185
0:08:56.914,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Maybe it's the ick factor.

186
0:08:58.936,000 --> 0:09:,000
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists

187
0:09:01.806,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in Canada who have now created a stool sample,

188
0:09:04.783,000 --> 0:09:06,000
a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.

189
0:09:07.567,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,

190
0:09:09.855,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we give everyone a toilet.

191
0:09:11.74,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And this is where it gets really interesting,

192
0:09:13.893,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.

193
0:09:16.818,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So the really interesting, exciting work --

194
0:09:20.911,000 --> 0:09:22,000
this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that

195
0:09:23.847,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we need to understand human psychology.

196
0:09:26.175,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We need to understand software

197
0:09:28.551,000 --> 0:09:3,000
as well as just giving someone hardware.

198
0:09:30.903,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They've found in many developing countries that

199
0:09:32.685,000 --> 0:09:34,000
governments have gone in and given out free latrines

200
0:09:35.407,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and gone back a few years later and found that they've

201
0:09:37.563,000 --> 0:09:41,000
got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms

202
0:09:41.686,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with their owners happily walking past them

203
0:09:44.053,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and going over to the open defecating ground.

204
0:09:47.863,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.

205
0:09:50.887,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it

206
0:09:53.388,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in the early 20th century.

207
0:09:55.327,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.

208
0:09:58.086,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.

209
0:10:02.253,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In India now there's a campaign

210
0:10:03.608,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which persuades young brides

211
0:10:06.154,000 --> 0:10:09,000
not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.

212
0:10:09.252,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's called "No Loo, No I Do."

213
0:10:11.92,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:14.267,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And in case you think that poster's just propaganda,

215
0:10:16.242,000 --> 0:10:18,000
here's Priyanka, 23 years old.

216
0:10:18.342,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I met her last October in India,

217
0:10:20.463,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and she grew up in a conservative environment.

218
0:10:23.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,

219
0:10:26.616,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,

220
0:10:30.782,000 --> 0:10:31,000
she moved into her in-law's house.

221
0:10:32.553,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And she was horrified to get there and find

222
0:10:34.588,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that they didn't have a toilet.

223
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She'd grown up with a latrine.

224
0:10:37.247,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.

225
0:10:39.201,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the first night she was there, she was told

226
0:10:41.224,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that at 4 o'clock in the morning --

227
0:10:42.431,000 --> 0:10:44,000
her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside

228
0:10:45.27,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and go and do it in the dark in the open.

229
0:10:48.09,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.

230
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.

231
0:10:53.034,000 --> 0:10:55,000
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.

232
0:10:55.516,000 --> 0:10:56,000
She left.

233
0:10:57.256,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And if you know anything about rural India,

234
0:10:58.841,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.

235
0:11:02.319,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But not just that.

236
0:11:03.376,000 --> 0:11:05,000
She got her toilet, and now she goes around

237
0:11:05.788,000 --> 0:11:06,000
all the other villages in India

238
0:11:07.386,000 --> 0:11:08,000
persuading other women to do the same thing.

239
0:11:09.139,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful

240
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and really exciting.

241
0:11:14.775,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Another version of this, another village in India

242
0:11:16.864,000 --> 0:11:17,000
near where Priyanka lives

243
0:11:18.861,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,

244
0:11:22.736,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it had no toilets whatsoever.

245
0:11:24.187,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.

246
0:11:26.481,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks

247
0:11:30.823,000 --> 0:11:32,000
like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit

248
0:11:33.617,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and watching the flies go one to the other.

249
0:11:35.834,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Somehow, people who'd been thinking

250
0:11:38.401,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that what they were doing was not disgusting at all

251
0:11:39.93,000 --> 0:11:4,000
suddenly thought, "Oops."

252
0:11:41.802,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.

253
0:11:44.129,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That's what really made them change their behavior.

254
0:11:47.257,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So this woman, this boy's mother

255
0:11:49.793,000 --> 0:11:51,000
installed this latrine in a few hours.

256
0:11:52.278,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,

257
0:11:54.661,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but she installed the latrine in a few hours.

258
0:11:56.229,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.

259
0:11:59.902,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,

260
0:12:03.093,000 --> 0:12:05,000
even though these are pretty exciting times

261
0:12:05.289,000 --> 0:12:07,000
because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

262
0:12:07.867,000 --> 0:12:09,000
reinventing the toilet, which is great,

263
0:12:09.929,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,

264
0:12:12.483,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.

265
0:12:16.218,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But there are things to worry about.

266
0:12:17.932,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.

267
0:12:20.69,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's about 50 or so years off track.

268
0:12:23.036,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We're not going to meet targets,

269
0:12:24.372,000 --> 0:12:27,000
providing people with sanitation at this rate.

270
0:12:27.657,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So when I get sad about sanitation,

271
0:12:31.138,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago

272
0:12:34.457,000 --> 0:12:36,000
was a nation of people who used pit latrines

273
0:12:37.046,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and wiped with sticks,

274
0:12:39.178,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,

275
0:12:42.505,000 --> 0:12:43,000
washlet toilets.

276
0:12:43.985,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,

277
0:12:46.329,000 --> 0:12:48,000
hands-free cleaning experience,

278
0:12:49.074,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and they have various other features

279
0:12:51.246,000 --> 0:12:53,000
like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device

280
0:12:54.221,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which is known as the "marriage-saver."

281
0:12:56.562,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

282
0:12:58.018,000 --> 0:13:,000
But most importantly, what they have done in Japan,

283
0:13:00.423,000 --> 0:13:01,000
which I find so inspirational,

284
0:13:01.923,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.

285
0:13:04.487,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They've made it conversational.

286
0:13:05.988,000 --> 0:13:08,000
People go out and upgrade their toilet.

287
0:13:09.39,000 --> 0:13:13,000
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.

288
0:13:13.798,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.

289
0:13:18.278,000 --> 0:13:2,000
All we really need to do

290
0:13:20.548,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is look at this issue

291
0:13:22.39,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.

292
0:13:26.702,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.

293
0:13:29.475,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Our sewers are crumbling.

294
0:13:31.639,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Things are going wrong here too.

295
0:13:33.806,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The solution to all of this is pretty easy.

296
0:13:36.705,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon

297
0:13:38.426,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and just ask you to do one thing,

298
0:13:40.779,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and that's to go out, protest,

299
0:13:43.855,000 --> 0:13:45,000
speak about the unspeakable,

300
0:13:46.093,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and talk shit.

301
0:13:47.632,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Thank you.

302
0:13:49.586,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Applause)

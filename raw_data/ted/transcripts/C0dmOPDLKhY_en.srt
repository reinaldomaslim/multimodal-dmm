1
0:00:12.562,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to tell you about a patient named Donna.

2
0:00:16.239,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In this photograph, Donna was in her mid-70s,

3
0:00:18.728,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a vigorous, healthy woman,

4
0:00:20.127,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the matriarch of a large clan.

5
0:00:22.586,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She had a family history of heart disease, however,

6
0:00:25.015,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and one day, she had the sudden onset of crushing chest pain.

7
0:00:28.742,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now unfortunately, rather than seeking medical attention,

8
0:00:31.434,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Donna took to her bed for about 12 hours until the pain passed.

9
0:00:35.374,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The next time she went to see her physician,

10
0:00:37.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
he performed an electrocardiogram,

11
0:00:39.119,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and this showed that she'd had a large heart attack,

12
0:00:41.587,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or a "myocardial infarction" in medical parlance.

13
0:00:45.496,000 --> 0:00:48,000
After this heart attack, Donna was never quite the same.

14
0:00:48.57,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Her energy levels progressively waned,

15
0:00:51.216,000 --> 0:00:54,000
she couldn't do a lot of the physical activities she'd previously enjoyed.

16
0:00:54.898,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It got to the point where she couldn't keep up with her grandkids,

17
0:00:58.036,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and it was even too much work to go out to the end of the driveway

18
0:01:01.201,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to pick up the mail.

19
0:01:02.376,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One day, her granddaughter came by to walk the dog,

20
0:01:05.453,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and she found her grandmother dead in the chair.

21
0:01:08.673,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia that was secondary to heart failure.

22
0:01:13.98,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But the last thing that I should tell you

23
0:01:16.008,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is that Donna was not just an ordinary patient.

24
0:01:18.902,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Donna was my mother.

25
0:01:21.445,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Stories like ours are, unfortunately, far too common.

26
0:01:24.913,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Heart disease is the number one killer in the entire world.

27
0:01:27.896,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In the United States,

28
0:01:29.079,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's the most common reason patients are admitted to the hospital,

29
0:01:32.231,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and it's our number one health care expense.

30
0:01:34.313,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We spend over a 100 billion dollars -- billion with a "B" --

31
0:01:37.265,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in this country every year

32
0:01:38.551,000 --> 0:01:39,000
on the treatment of heart disease.

33
0:01:40.407,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Just for reference, that's more than twice the annual budget

34
0:01:43.308,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of the state of Washington.

35
0:01:45.1,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What makes this disease so deadly?

36
0:01:47.757,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Well, it all starts with the fact that the heart is the least regenerative organ

37
0:01:51.667,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in the human body.

38
0:01:53.502,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now, a heart attack happens when a blood clot forms in a coronary artery

39
0:01:57.494,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that feeds blood to the wall of the heart.

40
0:02:00.013,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This plugs the blood flow,

41
0:02:02.135,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the heart muscle is very metabolically active,

42
0:02:04.574,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and so it dies very quickly,

43
0:02:05.946,000 --> 0:02:08,000
within just a few hours of having its blood flow interrupted.

44
0:02:10.446,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Since the heart can't grow back new muscle,

45
0:02:12.869,000 --> 0:02:14,000
it heals by scar formation.

46
0:02:15.999,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This leaves the patient with a deficit

47
0:02:18.137,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the amount of heart muscle that they have.

48
0:02:20.467,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And in too many people, their illness progresses to the point

49
0:02:23.407,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where the heart can no longer keep up with the body's demand for blood flow.

50
0:02:27.289,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This imbalance between supply and demand is the crux of heart failure.

51
0:02:34.877,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So when I talk to people about this problem,

52
0:02:38.27,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I often get a shrug and a statement to the effect of,

53
0:02:42.103,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Well, you know, Chuck, we've got to die of something."

54
0:02:44.864,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:48.311,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And yeah, but what this also tells me

56
0:02:51.692,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is that we've resigned ourselves to this as the status quo because we have to.

57
0:02:58.801,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Or do we?

58
0:03:00.459,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I think there's a better way,

59
0:03:02.176,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and this better way involves the use of stem cells as medicines.

60
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So what, exactly, are stem cells?

61
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
If you look at them under the microscope, there's not much going on.

62
0:03:12.021,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They're just simple little round cells.

63
0:03:13.941,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But that belies two remarkable attributes.

64
0:03:16.922,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The first is they can divide like crazy.

65
0:03:19.261,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So I can take a single cell, and in a month's time,

66
0:03:22.119,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I can grow this up to billions of cells.

67
0:03:24.55,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The second is they can differentiate or become more specialized,

68
0:03:29.375,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so these simple little round cells can turn into skin, can turn into brain,

69
0:03:33.544,000 --> 0:03:35,000
can turn into kidney and so forth.

70
0:03:36.377,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, some tissues in our bodies are chock-full of stem cells.

71
0:03:39.487,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Our bone marrow, for example, cranks out billions of blood cells every day.

72
0:03:43.808,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Other tissues like the heart are quite stable,

73
0:03:46.266,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and as far as we can tell, the heart lacks stem cells entirely.

74
0:03:50.45,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So for the heart, we're going to have to bring stem cells in from the outside,

75
0:03:54.435,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and for this, we turn to the most potent stem cell type,

76
0:03:57.339,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the pluripotent stem cell.

77
0:03:59.366,000 --> 0:04:,000
Pluripotent stem cells are so named

78
0:04:01.106,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because they can turn into any of the 240-some cell types

79
0:04:04.199,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that make up the human body.

80
0:04:06.684,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So this is my big idea:

81
0:04:08.691,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I want to take human pluripotent stem cells,

82
0:04:11.469,000 --> 0:04:13,000
grow them up in large numbers,

83
0:04:13.62,000 --> 0:04:15,000
differentiate them into cardiac muscle cells

84
0:04:16.444,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and then take them out of the dish

85
0:04:18.209,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and transplant them into the hearts of patients who have had heart attacks.

86
0:04:22.137,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I think this is going to reseed the wall with new muscle tissue,

87
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and this will restore contractile function to the heart.

88
0:04:29.296,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Applause)

89
0:04:36.49,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, before you applaud too much, this was my idea 20 years ago.

90
0:04:39.829,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:41.892,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I was young, I was full of it, and I thought,

92
0:04:45.816,000 --> 0:04:47,000
five years in the lab, and we'll crank this out,

93
0:04:48.165,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we'll have this into the clinic.

94
0:04:50.763,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Let me tell you what really happened.

95
0:04:52.817,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:53.96,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We began with the quest to turn these pluripotent stem cells into heart muscle.

97
0:04:58.689,000 --> 0:05:,000
And our first experiments worked, sort of.

98
0:05:01.229,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We got these little clumps of beating human heart muscle in the dish,

99
0:05:05.019,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that was cool, because it said, in principle,

100
0:05:07.467,000 --> 0:05:09,000
this should be able to be done.

101
0:05:09.753,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But when we got around to doing the cell counts,

102
0:05:12.052,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we found that only one out of 1,000 of our stem cells

103
0:05:15.107,000 --> 0:05:17,000
were actually turning into heart muscle.

104
0:05:17.937,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The rest was just a gemisch of brain and skin and cartilage

105
0:05:23.481,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and intestine.

106
0:05:25.824,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So how do you coax a cell that can become anything

107
0:05:29.177,000 --> 0:05:31,000
into becoming just a heart muscle cell?

108
0:05:32.243,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Well, for this we turned to the world of embryology.

109
0:05:34.862,000 --> 0:05:36,000
For over a century, the embryologists had been pondering

110
0:05:37.584,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the mysteries of heart development.

111
0:05:39.29,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And they had given us what was essentially a Google Map

112
0:05:42.671,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for how to go from a single fertilized egg

113
0:05:45.175,000 --> 0:05:48,000
all the way over to a human cardiovascular system.

114
0:05:48.656,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So we shamelessly absconded all of this information

115
0:05:52.411,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and tried to make human cardiovascular development happen in a dish.

116
0:05:57.105,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It took us about five years, but nowadays,

117
0:05:59.595,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we can get 90 percent of our stem cells to turn into cardiac muscle --

118
0:06:03.21,000 --> 0:06:05,000
a 900-fold improvement.

119
0:06:05.671,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So this was quite exciting.

120
0:06:08.112,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This slide shows you our current cellular product.

121
0:06:11.466,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We grow our heart muscle cells in little three-dimensional clumps

122
0:06:14.779,000 --> 0:06:15,000
called cardiac organoids.

123
0:06:16.313,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Each of them has 500 to 1,000 heart muscle cells in it.

124
0:06:20.003,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If you look closely, you can see these little organoids are actually twitching;

125
0:06:23.834,000 --> 0:06:24,000
each one is beating independently.

126
0:06:26.094,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But they've got another trick up their sleeve.

127
0:06:28.793,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We took a gene from jellyfish that live in the Pacific Northwest,

128
0:06:31.988,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we used a technique called genome editing

129
0:06:34.412,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to splice this gene into the stem cells.

130
0:06:37.45,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this makes our heart muscle cells flash green every time they beat.

131
0:06:41.899,000 --> 0:06:44,000
OK, so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments.

132
0:06:45.612,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We took our cardiac muscle cells

133
0:06:47.997,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we transplanted them into the hearts of rats

134
0:06:50.295,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that had been given experimental heart attacks.

135
0:06:52.541,000 --> 0:06:55,000
A month later, I peered anxiously down through my microscope

136
0:06:56.117,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to see what we had grown,

137
0:06:58.032,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I saw ...

138
0:06:59.807,000 --> 0:07:,000
nothing.

139
0:07:01.616,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Everything had died.

140
0:07:03.407,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But we persevered on this, and we came up with a biochemical cocktail

141
0:07:07.379,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that we called our "pro-survival cocktail,"

142
0:07:09.707,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and this was enough to allow our cells to survive

143
0:07:12.354,000 --> 0:07:15,000
through the stressful process of transplantation.

144
0:07:15.456,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And now when I looked through the microscope,

145
0:07:17.63,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I could see this fresh, young, human heart muscle

146
0:07:20.169,000 --> 0:07:23,000
growing back in the injured wall of this rat's heart.

147
0:07:23.75,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So this was getting quite exciting.

148
0:07:25.567,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The next question was:

149
0:07:27.13,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Will this new muscle beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart?

150
0:07:31.453,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So to answer that,

151
0:07:32.638,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we returned to the cells that had that jellyfish gene in them.

152
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We used these cells essentially like a space probe

153
0:07:40.481,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that we could launch into a foreign environment

154
0:07:42.745,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and then have that flashing report back to us

155
0:07:45.089,000 --> 0:07:47,000
about their biological activity.

156
0:07:47.171,000 --> 0:07:49,000
What you're seeing here is a zoomed-in view,

157
0:07:49.276,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a black-and-white image of a guinea pig's heart

158
0:07:51.522,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that was injured and then received three grafts of our human cardiac muscle.

159
0:07:55.147,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So you see those sort of diagonally running white lines.

160
0:07:57.813,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Each of those is a needle track

161
0:07:59.323,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that contains a couple of million human cardiac muscle cells in it.

162
0:08:03.713,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And when I start the video, you can see what we saw

163
0:08:06.491,000 --> 0:08:08,000
when we looked through the microscope.

164
0:08:09.011,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Our cells are flashing,

165
0:08:10.598,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and they're flashing in synchrony,

166
0:08:12.647,000 --> 0:08:14,000
back through the walls of the injured heart.

167
0:08:15.117,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What does this mean?

168
0:08:16.292,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It means the cells are alive,

169
0:08:17.8,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they're well, they're beating,

170
0:08:19.972,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and they've managed to connect with one another

171
0:08:22.225,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so that they're beating in synchrony.

172
0:08:24.321,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But it gets even more interesting than this.

173
0:08:26.46,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If you look at that tracing that's along the bottom,

174
0:08:28.927,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that's the electrocardiogram from the guinea pig's own heart.

175
0:08:32.296,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And if you line up the flashing with the heartbeat

176
0:08:35.473,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that's shown on the bottom,

177
0:08:36.797,000 --> 0:08:39,000
what you can see is there's a perfect one-to-one correspondence.

178
0:08:40.008,000 --> 0:08:44,000
In other words, the guinea pig's natural pacemaker is calling the shots,

179
0:08:44.498,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and the human heart muscle cells are following in lockstep

180
0:08:47.506,000 --> 0:08:48,000
like good soldiers.

181
0:08:49.922,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

182
0:08:56.017,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Our current studies have moved into what I think is going to be

183
0:08:59.041,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the best possible predictor of a human patient,

184
0:09:01.726,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and that's into macaque monkeys.

185
0:09:05.35,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This next slide shows you a microscopic image

186
0:09:08.47,000 --> 0:09:12,000
from the heart of a macaque that was given an experimental heart attack

187
0:09:12.936,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then treated with a saline injection.

188
0:09:15.039,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This is essentially like a placebo treatment

189
0:09:17.296,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to show the natural history of the disease.

190
0:09:19.485,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The macaque heart muscle is shown in red,

191
0:09:21.777,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and in blue, you see the scar tissue that results from the heart attack.

192
0:09:25.305,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So as you look as this, you can see how there's a big deficiency in the muscle

193
0:09:29.211,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in part of the wall of the heart.

194
0:09:31.153,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And it's not hard to imagine how this heart would have a tough time

195
0:09:34.42,000 --> 0:09:35,000
generating much force.

196
0:09:37.105,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now in contrast, this is one of the stem-cell-treated hearts.

197
0:09:41.29,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Again, you can see the monkey's heart muscle in red,

198
0:09:45.249,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but it's very hard to even see the blue scar tissue,

199
0:09:47.98,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and that's because we've been able to repopulate it

200
0:09:51.124,000 --> 0:09:52,000
with the human heart muscle,

201
0:09:53.012,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and so we've got this nice, plump wall.

202
0:09:55.218,000 --> 0:09:57,000
OK, let's just take a second and recap.

203
0:09:57.678,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I've showed you that we can take our stem cells

204
0:10:00.236,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and differentiate them into cardiac muscle.

205
0:10:02.772,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We've learned how to keep them alive after transplantation,

206
0:10:05.996,000 --> 0:10:08,000
we've showed that they beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart,

207
0:10:09.275,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we've shown that we can scale them up

208
0:10:11.294,000 --> 0:10:15,000
into an animal that is the best possible predictor of a human's response.

209
0:10:16.592,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You'd think that we hit all the roadblocks that lay in our path, right?

210
0:10:23.141,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Turns out, not.

211
0:10:24.982,000 --> 0:10:26,000
These macaque studies also taught us

212
0:10:27.401,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that our human heart muscle cells created a period of electrical instability.

213
0:10:32.128,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They caused ventricular arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats,

214
0:10:35.733,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for several weeks after we transplanted them.

215
0:10:39.038,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This was quite unexpected, because we hadn't seen this in smaller animals.

216
0:10:43.266,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We've studied it extensively,

217
0:10:45.077,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and it turns out that it results from the fact that our cellular graphs

218
0:10:49.089,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are quite immature,

219
0:10:50.651,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and immature heart muscle cells all act like pacemakers.

220
0:10:54.257,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So what happens is, we put them into the heart,

221
0:10:56.676,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and there starts to be a competition with the heart's natural pacemaker

222
0:11:00.145,000 --> 0:11:01,000
over who gets to call the shots.

223
0:11:02.502,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It would be sort of like

224
0:11:03.689,000 --> 0:11:07,000
if you brought a whole gaggle of teenagers into your orderly household all at once,

225
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and they don't want to follow the rules and the rhythms of the way you run things,

226
0:11:12.491,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and it takes a while to rein everybody in

227
0:11:14.487,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and get people working in a coordinated fashion.

228
0:11:17.471,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So our plans at the moment

229
0:11:18.744,000 --> 0:11:21,000
are to make the cells go through this troubled adolescence period

230
0:11:21.911,000 --> 0:11:22,000
while they're still in the dish,

231
0:11:23.917,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and then we'll transplant them in in the post-adolescent phase,

232
0:11:28.362,000 --> 0:11:29,000
where they should be much more orderly

233
0:11:30.356,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and be ready to listen to their marching orders.

234
0:11:33.11,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In the meantime, it turns out we can actually do quite well

235
0:11:35.938,000 --> 0:11:37,000
by treating with anti-arrhythmia drugs as well.

236
0:11:39.064,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So one big question still remains,

237
0:11:41.678,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and that is, of course, the whole purpose that we set out to do this:

238
0:11:44.991,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Can we actually restore function to the injured heart?

239
0:11:49.218,000 --> 0:11:5,000
To answer this question,

240
0:11:50.502,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we went to something that's called "left ventricular ejection fraction."

241
0:11:54.292,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Ejection fraction is simply the amount of blood

242
0:11:56.646,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that is squeezed out of the chamber of the heart

243
0:11:59.036,000 --> 0:12:,000
with each beat.

244
0:12:00.232,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, in healthy macaques, like in healthy people,

245
0:12:02.715,000 --> 0:12:04,000
ejection fractions are about 65 percent.

246
0:12:05.748,000 --> 0:12:09,000
After a heart attack, ejection fraction drops down to about 40 percent,

247
0:12:09.892,000 --> 0:12:11,000
so these animals are well on their way to heart failure.

248
0:12:12.75,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In the animals that receive a placebo injection,

249
0:12:15.049,000 --> 0:12:16,000
when we scan them a month later,

250
0:12:16.648,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we see that ejection fraction is unchanged,

251
0:12:18.961,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because the heart, of course, doesn't spontaneously recover.

252
0:12:22.489,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But in every one of the animals that received a graft

253
0:12:25.296,000 --> 0:12:26,000
of human cardiac muscle cells,

254
0:12:27.031,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we see a substantial improvement in cardiac function.

255
0:12:30.053,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This averaged eight points, so from 40 to 48 percent.

256
0:12:34.011,000 --> 0:12:37,000
What I can tell you is that eight points is better

257
0:12:37.091,000 --> 0:12:39,000
than anything that's on the market right now

258
0:12:39.443,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for treating patients with heart attacks.

259
0:12:41.478,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's better than everything we have put together.

260
0:12:44.231,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So if we could do eight points in the clinic,

261
0:12:46.408,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact

262
0:12:49.443,000 --> 0:12:5,000
on human health.

263
0:12:51.137,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But it gets more exciting.

264
0:12:54.742,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That was just four weeks after transplantation.

265
0:12:57.445,000 --> 0:12:59,000
If we extend these studies out to three months,

266
0:13:00.369,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we get a full 22-point gain in ejection fraction.

267
0:13:04.455,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

268
0:13:11.874,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Function in these treated hearts is so good

269
0:13:14.348,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that if we didn't know up front that these animals had had a heart attack,

270
0:13:18.202,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we would never be able to tell from their functional studies.

271
0:13:24.757,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Going forward, our plan is to start phase one,

272
0:13:28.435,000 --> 0:13:31,000
first in human trials here at the University of Washington in 2020 --

273
0:13:32.104,000 --> 0:13:33,000
two short years from now.

274
0:13:34.834,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Presuming these studies are safe and effective,

275
0:13:37.926,000 --> 0:13:38,000
which I think they're going to be,

276
0:13:39.896,000 --> 0:13:43,000
our plan is to scale this up and ship these cells all around the world

277
0:13:44.061,000 --> 0:13:46,000
for the treatment of patients with heart disease.

278
0:13:46.996,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Given the global burden of this illness,

279
0:13:48.982,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I could easily imagine this treating a million or more patients a year.

280
0:13:52.916,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So I envision a time, maybe a decade from now,

281
0:13:55.596,000 --> 0:13:58,000
where a patient like my mother will have actual treatments

282
0:13:58.829,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that can address the root cause and not just manage her symptoms.

283
0:14:02.967,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This all comes from the fact that stem cells give us the ability

284
0:14:06.063,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to repair the human body

285
0:14:07.786,000 --> 0:14:09,000
from its component parts.

286
0:14:10.774,000 --> 0:14:12,000
In the not-too-distant future,

287
0:14:12.889,000 --> 0:14:15,000
repairing humans is going to go

288
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
from something that is far-fetched science fiction

289
0:14:19.244,000 --> 0:14:21,000
into common medical practice.

290
0:14:22.043,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And when this happens,

291
0:14:23.396,000 --> 0:14:25,000
it's going to have a transformational effect

292
0:14:25.498,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that rivals the development of vaccinations and antibiotics.

293
0:14:30.148,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you for your attention.

294
0:14:31.619,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a neuroscientist,

2
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,

3
0:00:16.36,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and our mission is to train the next generation of neuroscientists

4
0:00:20.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
by taking graduate-level neuroscience research equipment

5
0:00:23.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and making it available for kids in middle schools and high schools.

6
0:00:27.52,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And so when we go into the classroom,

7
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:32,000
one way to get them thinking about the brain, which is very complex,

8
0:00:33.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is to ask them a very simple question about neuroscience,

9
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and that is, "What has a brain?"

10
0:00:39.04,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When we ask that,

11
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:44,000
students will instantly tell you that their cat or dog has a brain,

12
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and most will say that a mouse or even a small insect has a brain,

13
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but almost nobody says that a plant or a tree

14
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or a shrub has a brain.

15
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And so when you push --

16
0:00:56.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because this could actually help describe a little bit

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how the brain actually functions --

18
0:01:01.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so you push and say,

19
0:01:02.6,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"Well, what is it that makes living things have brains versus not?"

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And often they'll come back with the classification

21
0:01:08.64,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that things that move tend to have brains.

22
0:01:12.44,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And that's absolutely correct.

23
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Our nervous system evolved because it is electrical.

24
0:01:16.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's fast, so we can quickly respond to stimuli in the world

25
0:01:19.72,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and move if we need to.

26
0:01:21.96,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But you can go back and push back on a student,

27
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and say, "Well, you know, you say that plants don't have brains,

28
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but plants do move."

29
0:01:28.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Anyone who has grown a plant

30
0:01:30.64,000 --> 0:01:31,000
has noticed that the plant will move

31
0:01:32.64,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and face the sun.

32
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But they'll say, "But that's a slow movement.

33
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You know, that doesn't count. That could be a chemical process."

34
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But what about fast-moving plants?

35
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs, the Royal Governor of North Carolina,

36
0:01:47.2,000 --> 0:01:49,000
made a pretty fascinating discovery.

37
0:01:49.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In the swamps behind his house,

38
0:01:52.64,000 --> 0:01:55,000
he found a plant that would spring shut

39
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:58,000
every time a bug would fall in between it.

40
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He called this plant the flytrap,

41
0:02:02.68,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and within a decade, it made its way over to Europe,

42
0:02:05.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
where eventually the great Charles Darwin got to study this plant,

43
0:02:09.2,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and this plant absolutely blew him away.

44
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
He called it the most wonderful plant in the world.

45
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder.

46
0:02:16.08,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is a plant that moves quickly,

47
0:02:18.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which is rare,

48
0:02:19.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.

49
0:02:21.4,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And this is in the same plant.

50
0:02:22.88,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But I'm here today to tell you

51
0:02:24.36,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that's not even the coolest thing about this plant.

52
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The coolest thing is that the plant can count.

53
0:02:30.56,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So in order to show that,

54
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we have to get some vocabulary out of the way.

55
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So I'm going to do what we do in the classroom with students.

56
0:02:37.44,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We're going to do an experiment on electrophysiology,

57
0:02:41.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
which is the recording of the body's electrical signal,

58
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
either coming from neurons or from muscles.

59
0:02:46.8,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I'm putting some electrodes here on my wrists.

60
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As I hook them up,

61
0:02:50.52,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we're going to be able to see a signal

62
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:53,000
on the screen here.

63
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And this signal may be familiar to you.

64
0:02:56.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram.

65
0:02:58.32,000 --> 0:03:,000
And this is coming from neurons in my heart

66
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that are firing what's called action potentials,

67
0:03:03.36,000 --> 0:03:06,000
potential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down,

68
0:03:07.24,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which causes my heart to fire,

69
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which then causes the signal that you see here.

70
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so I want you to remember the shape of what we'll be looking at right here,

71
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because this is going to be important.

72
0:03:17.2,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This is a way that the brain encodes information

73
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in the form of an action potential.

74
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So now let's turn to some plants.

75
0:03:24.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So I'm going to first introduce you to the mimosa,

76
0:03:28.48,000 --> 0:03:31,000
not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,

77
0:03:31.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and this is a plant that's found in Central America and South America,

78
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it has behaviors.

79
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the first behavior I'm going to show you

80
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is if I touch the leaves here,

81
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you get to see that the leaves tend to curl up.

82
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And then the second behavior is,

83
0:03:47.56,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if I tap the leaf,

84
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the entire branch seems to fall down.

85
0:03:51.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So why does it do that?

86
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's not really known to science.

87
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:57,000
One of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects

88
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
or it looks less appealing to herbivores.

89
0:04:00.24,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But how does it do that? Now, that's interesting.

90
0:04:02.76,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We can do an experiment to find out.

91
0:04:04.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So what we're going to do now,

92
0:04:06.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
just like I recorded the electrical potential from my body,

93
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we're going to record the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa.

94
0:04:13.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And so what we're going to do is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,

95
0:04:19.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I've got the ground electrode where?

96
0:04:22.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In the ground. It's an electrical engineering joke. Alright.

97
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead and tap the leaf here,

99
0:04:29.44,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I want you to look at the electrical recording

100
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that we're going to see inside the plant.

101
0:04:34.52,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Whoa. It is so big, I've got to scale it down.

102
0:04:37.44,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Alright. So what is that?

103
0:04:38.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That is an action potential that is happening inside the plant.

104
0:04:41.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Why was it happening?

105
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Because it wanted to move. Right?

106
0:04:44.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And so when I hit the touch receptors,

107
0:04:47.84,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it sent a voltage all the way down to the end of the stem,

108
0:04:51.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which caused it to move.

109
0:04:52.32,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And now, in our arms, we would move our muscles,

110
0:04:54.6,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but the plant doesn't have muscles.

111
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What it has is water inside the cells

112
0:04:58.6,000 --> 0:05:,000
and when the voltage hits it, it opens up, releases the water,

113
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:03,000
changes the shape of the cells, and the leaf falls.

114
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:08,000
OK. So here we see an action potential encoding information to move. Alright?

115
0:05:09.44,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But can it do more?

116
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So let's go to find out.

117
0:05:12.24,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're going to go to our good friend, the Venus flytrap here,

118
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and we're going to take a look at what happens inside the leaf

119
0:05:19.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when a fly lands on here.

120
0:05:21.72,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So I'm going to pretend to be a fly right now.

121
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And now here's my Venus flytrap,

122
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and inside the leaf, you're going to notice

123
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that there are three little hairs here, and those are trigger hairs.

124
0:05:31.4,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so when a fly lands --

125
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm going to touch one of the hairs right now.

126
0:05:35.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Ready? One, two, three.

127
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What do we get? We get a beautiful action potential.

128
0:05:41.48,000 --> 0:05:43,000
However, the flytrap doesn't close.

129
0:05:44.64,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And to understand why that is,

130
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap.

131
0:05:49.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Number one is that it takes a long time to open the traps back up --

132
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it.

133
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And so it takes a lot of energy.

134
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And two, it doesn't need to eat that many flies throughout the year.

135
0:06:01.84,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Only a handful. It gets most of its energy from the sun.

136
0:06:04.52,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies.

137
0:06:07.76,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And the third thing is,

138
0:06:09.04,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it only opens then closes the traps a handful of times

139
0:06:12.04,000 --> 0:06:13,000
until that trap dies.

140
0:06:14.12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So therefore, it wants to make really darn sure

141
0:06:16.84,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that there's a meal inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut.

142
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So how does it do that?

143
0:06:23.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It counts the number of seconds

144
0:06:25.92,000 --> 0:06:28,000
between successive touching of those hairs.

145
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And so the idea is that there's a high probability,

146
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
if there's a fly inside of there, they're going to be quick together,

147
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and so when it gets the first action potential,

148
0:06:37.32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it starts counting, one, two,

149
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and if it gets to 20 and it doesn't fire again,

150
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:42,000
then it's not going to close,

151
0:06:42.44,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but if it does it within there, then the flytrap will close.

152
0:06:45.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So we're going to go back now.

153
0:06:46.8,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again.

154
0:06:48.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I've been talking for more than 20 seconds.

155
0:06:50.88,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So we can see what happens when I touch the hair a second time.

156
0:06:55.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So what do we get? We get a second action potential,

157
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but again, the leaf doesn't close.

158
0:07:00.12,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So now if I go back in there

159
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and if I'm a fly moving around,

160
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I'm going to be touching the leaf a few times.

161
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.

162
0:07:08.64,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And immediately,

163
0:07:10.08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the flytrap closes.

164
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So here we are seeing the flytrap actually doing a computation.

165
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's determining if there's a fly inside the trap,

166
0:07:18.52,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and then it closes.

167
0:07:20.04,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So let's go back to our original question.

168
0:07:23.52,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Do plants have brains?

169
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Well, the answer is no.

170
0:07:27.44,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There's no brains in here.

171
0:07:28.84,000 --> 0:07:31,000
There's no axons, no neurons.

172
0:07:32.44,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It doesn't get depressed.

173
0:07:33.84,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It doesn't want to know what the Tigers' score is.

174
0:07:36.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It doesn't have self-actualization problems.

175
0:07:38.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But what it does have is something that's very similar to us,

176
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which is the ability to communicate using electricity.

177
0:07:44.88,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It just uses slightly different ions than we do,

178
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but it's actually doing the same thing.

179
0:07:49.2,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So just to show you

180
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the ubiquitous nature of these action potentials,

181
0:07:54.72,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we saw it in the Venus flytrap,

182
0:07:56.96,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we've seen an action potential in the mimosa.

183
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We've even seen an action potential in a human.

184
0:08:01.52,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, this is the euro of the brain.

185
0:08:04.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's the way that all information is passed.

186
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And so what we can do is we can use those action potentials

187
0:08:09.76,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to pass information

188
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:12,000
between species of plants.

189
0:08:13.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator,

190
0:08:17.48,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and what we've done is we've created a brand new experiment

191
0:08:20.68,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where we're going to record the action potential from a Venus flytrap,

192
0:08:24.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and we're going to send it into the sensitive mimosa.

193
0:08:27.04,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So I want you to recall what happens

194
0:08:28.8,000 --> 0:08:29,000
when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.

195
0:08:30.76,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It has touch receptors that are sending that information

196
0:08:33.44,000 --> 0:08:35,000
back down in the form of an action potential.

197
0:08:35.56,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so what would happen

198
0:08:36.92,000 --> 0:08:39,000
if we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap

199
0:08:40.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and sent it into all the stems of the mimosa?

200
0:08:44.44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We should be able to create the behavior of the mimosas

201
0:08:47.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
without actually touching it ourselves.

202
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And so if you'll allow me,

203
0:08:51.44,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I'm going to go ahead and trigger this mimosa right now

204
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:57,000
by touching on the hairs of the Venus flytrap.

205
0:08:58.76,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So we're going to send information about touch from one plant to another.

206
0:09:06.64,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So there you see it.

207
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So --

208
0:09:09.6,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

209
0:09:15.64,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So I hope you learned a little bit, something about plants today,

210
0:09:18.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and not only that.

211
0:09:19.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience

212
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and bring along the neurorevolution.

213
0:09:24.76,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you.

214
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.868,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There's something that I'd like you to see.

3
0:00:16.473,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled

4
0:00:18.957,000 --> 0:00:2,000
millions in China:

5
0:00:21.011,000 --> 0:00:22,000
footage of a two-year-old girl

6
0:00:22.891,000 --> 0:00:26,000
hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,

7
0:00:27.443,000 --> 0:00:3,000
footage too graphic to be shown.

8
0:00:30.683,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The entire accident is caught on camera.

9
0:00:33.363,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The driver pauses after hitting the child,

10
0:00:36.171,000 --> 0:00:39,000
his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.

11
0:00:40.083,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.

12
0:00:44.028,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.

13
0:00:47.712,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Others look at her before moving off.

14
0:00:53.54,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Peter Singer: There were other people

15
0:00:54.807,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who walked past Wang Yue,

16
0:00:57.134,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and a second van ran over her legs

17
0:00:58.853,000 --> 0:01:01,000
before a street cleaner raised the alarm.

18
0:01:02.069,000 --> 0:01:07,000
She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.

19
0:01:07.27,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I wonder how many of you, looking at that,

20
0:01:11.078,000 --> 0:01:14,000
said to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that.

21
0:01:14.761,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I would have stopped to help."

22
0:01:16.965,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you.

23
0:01:20.865,000 --> 0:01:22,000
As I thought, that's most of you.

24
0:01:23.741,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And I believe you. I'm sure you're right.

25
0:01:25.708,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But before you give yourself too much credit,

26
0:01:28.947,000 --> 0:01:29,000
look at this.

27
0:01:30.609,000 --> 0:01:34,000
UNICEF reports that in 2011,

28
0:01:34.785,000 --> 0:01:37,000
6.9 million children under five

29
0:01:38.734,000 --> 0:01:43,000
died from preventable, poverty-related diseases.

30
0:01:44.186,000 --> 0:01:46,000
UNICEF thinks that that's good news

31
0:01:46.448,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because the figure has been steadily coming down

32
0:01:49.626,000 --> 0:01:53,000
from 12 million in 1990. That is good.

33
0:01:53.679,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But still, 6.9 million

34
0:01:56.783,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is 19,000 children dying every day.

35
0:02:02.107,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Does it really matter

36
0:02:04.893,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we're not walking past them in the street?

37
0:02:07.798,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Does it really matter that they're far away?

38
0:02:13.016,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.

39
0:02:16.434,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The fact that they're not right in front of us,

40
0:02:18.842,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality

41
0:02:21.003,000 --> 0:02:24,000
or race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.

42
0:02:24.978,000 --> 0:02:25,000
What is really important is,

43
0:02:26.498,000 --> 0:02:3,000
can we reduce that death toll? Can we save

44
0:02:30.763,000 --> 0:02:34,000
some of those 19,000 children dying every day?

45
0:02:35.729,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the answer is, yes we can.

46
0:02:39.347,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Each of us spends money

47
0:02:41.89,000 --> 0:02:43,000
on things that we do not really need.

48
0:02:44.071,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You can think what your own habit is,

49
0:02:46.003,000 --> 0:02:48,000
whether it's a new car, a vacation

50
0:02:48.568,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or just something like buying bottled water

51
0:02:51.248,000 --> 0:02:53,000
when the water that comes out of the tap

52
0:02:53.271,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is perfectly safe to drink.

53
0:02:55.801,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You could take the money you're spending

54
0:02:57.448,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on those unnecessary things

55
0:02:59.343,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and give it to this organization,

56
0:03:01.709,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the Against Malaria Foundation,

57
0:03:04.636,000 --> 0:03:06,000
which would take the money you had given

58
0:03:07.208,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and use it to buy nets like this one

59
0:03:10.911,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to protect children like this one,

60
0:03:14.45,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we know reliably that if we provide nets,

61
0:03:18.746,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they're used, and they reduce the number of children

62
0:03:22.148,000 --> 0:03:24,000
dying from malaria,

63
0:03:24.604,000 --> 0:03:26,000
just one of the many preventable diseases

64
0:03:27.412,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children

65
0:03:31.364,000 --> 0:03:34,000
dying every day.

66
0:03:35.012,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Fortunately, more and more people

67
0:03:37.196,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are understanding this idea,

68
0:03:39.71,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and the result is a growing movement:

69
0:03:43.028,000 --> 0:03:45,000
effective altruism.

70
0:03:45.684,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.

71
0:03:50.068,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The heart, of course, you felt.

72
0:03:51.779,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You felt the empathy for that child.

73
0:03:54.922,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But it's really important to use the head as well

74
0:03:58.956,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,

75
0:04:03.749,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and not only that, but also I think reason helps us

76
0:04:08.083,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to understand that other people, wherever they are,

77
0:04:11.852,000 --> 0:04:14,000
are like us, that they can suffer as we can,

78
0:04:15.443,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that parents grieve for the deaths of their children,

79
0:04:18.116,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as we do,

80
0:04:19.919,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,

81
0:04:24.137,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it matters just as much to all of these people.

82
0:04:27.38,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool

83
0:04:30.448,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to help you get whatever you want.

84
0:04:31.943,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It does help us to put perspective on our situation.

85
0:04:36.573,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I think that's why

86
0:04:38.452,000 --> 0:04:43,000
many of the most significant people in effective altruism

87
0:04:43.458,000 --> 0:04:45,000
have been people who have had backgrounds

88
0:04:45.842,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in philosophy or economics or math.

89
0:04:50.58,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And that might seem surprising,

90
0:04:52.045,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because a lot of people think,

91
0:04:53.378,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Philosophy is remote from the real world;

92
0:04:57.191,000 --> 0:05:,000
economics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,

93
0:05:01.134,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we know that math is for nerds."

94
0:05:04.665,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But in fact it does make a difference,

95
0:05:07.423,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and in fact there's one particular nerd

96
0:05:09.359,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who has been a particularly effective altruist

97
0:05:13.579,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because he got this.

98
0:05:15.496,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is the website of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,

99
0:05:18.775,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,

100
0:05:22.571,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it says, "All lives have equal value."

101
0:05:26.498,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's the understanding,

102
0:05:28.367,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the rational understanding of our situation in the world

103
0:05:31.989,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that has led to these people

104
0:05:34.25,000 --> 0:05:38,000
being the most effective altruists in history,

105
0:05:38.931,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.

106
0:05:41.603,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

107
0:05:47.736,000 --> 0:05:51,000
No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,

108
0:05:51.905,000 --> 0:05:53,000
has ever given as much to charity

109
0:05:54.563,000 --> 0:05:57,000
as each one of these three,

110
0:05:57.811,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and they have used their intelligence

111
0:06:00.563,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to make sure that it is highly effective.

112
0:06:04.643,000 --> 0:06:07,000
According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation

113
0:06:07.731,000 --> 0:06:1,000
has already saved 5.8 million lives

114
0:06:11.539,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and many millions more, people, getting diseases

115
0:06:14.697,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that would have made them very sick,

116
0:06:16.224,000 --> 0:06:19,000
even if eventually they survived.

117
0:06:19.475,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Over the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation

118
0:06:22.075,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is going to give a lot more,

119
0:06:24.739,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is going to save a lot more lives.

120
0:06:28.714,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,

121
0:06:32.956,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you can have that kind of impact.

122
0:06:35.38,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But if I'm not, what can I do?

123
0:06:38.328,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask

124
0:06:41.652,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that maybe stand in the way of them giving.

125
0:06:45.1,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They worry how much of a difference they can make.

126
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But you don't have to be a billionaire.

127
0:06:50.692,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy

128
0:06:54.356,000 --> 0:06:56,000
at the University of Oxford.

129
0:06:56.382,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He became an effective altruist when he calculated

130
0:06:59.97,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that with the money that he was likely to earn

131
0:07:02.245,000 --> 0:07:04,000
throughout his career, an academic career,

132
0:07:04.645,000 --> 0:07:1,000
he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness

133
0:07:11.312,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in developing countries

134
0:07:13.358,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and still have enough left

135
0:07:15.631,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for a perfectly adequate standard of living.

136
0:07:20.355,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So Toby founded an organization

137
0:07:22.352,000 --> 0:07:26,000
called Giving What We Can to spread this information,

138
0:07:26.438,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to unite people who want to share some of their income,

139
0:07:30.364,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent

140
0:07:33.077,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of what they earn over their lifetime

141
0:07:35.188,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to fighting global poverty.

142
0:07:38.509,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Toby himself does better than that.

143
0:07:40.948,000 --> 0:07:44,000
He's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year --

144
0:07:45.348,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that's less than 30,000 dollars --

145
0:07:48.092,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and to give the rest to those organizations.

146
0:07:51.492,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage.

147
0:07:57.066,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is a couple at a later stage of life,

148
0:08:00.711,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott,

149
0:08:03.707,000 --> 0:08:04,000
who, when they were young, when they met,

150
0:08:05.234,000 --> 0:08:08,000
were activists against the Vietnam War,

151
0:08:08.388,000 --> 0:08:09,000
fought for social justice,

152
0:08:10.367,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and then moved into careers, as most people do,

153
0:08:13.251,000 --> 0:08:16,000
didn't really do anything very active about those values,

154
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:18,000
although they didn't abandon them.

155
0:08:19.699,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And then, as they got to the age at which many people

156
0:08:22.078,000 --> 0:08:25,000
start to think of retirement, they returned to them,

157
0:08:25.484,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and they've decided to cut back on their spending,

158
0:08:28.648,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to live modestly, and to give both money and time

159
0:08:33.793,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to helping to fight global poverty.

160
0:08:38.671,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, mentioning time might lead you to think,

161
0:08:41.713,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time

162
0:08:45.337,000 --> 0:08:48,000
into saving some of these 19,000 lives

163
0:08:48.542,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that are lost every day?"

164
0:08:50.205,000 --> 0:08:52,000
One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue

165
0:08:52.907,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of how you can have a career that will have

166
0:08:55.73,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.

167
0:08:59.451,000 --> 0:09:01,000
He's a graduate student in philosophy,

168
0:09:02.107,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,

169
0:09:06.459,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the number of hours he estimates

170
0:09:08.133,000 --> 0:09:1,000
most people spend on their career,

171
0:09:10.505,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to advise people on how to have the best,

172
0:09:12.717,000 --> 0:09:13,000
most effective career.

173
0:09:14.697,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But you might be surprised to know

174
0:09:16.911,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,

175
0:09:19.932,000 --> 0:09:21,000
if they have the right abilities and character,

176
0:09:22.197,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is to go into banking or finance.

177
0:09:26.864,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Why? Because if you earn a lot of money,

178
0:09:30.675,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you can give away a lot of money,

179
0:09:33.014,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and if you're successful in that career,

180
0:09:35.06,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you could give enough to an aid organization

181
0:09:37.674,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers

182
0:09:42.604,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in developing countries, and each one of them

183
0:09:45.896,000 --> 0:09:46,000
would probably do about as much good

184
0:09:47.74,000 --> 0:09:48,000
as you would have done.

185
0:09:49.274,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So you can quintuple the impact

186
0:09:52.284,000 --> 0:09:56,000
by leading that kind of career.

187
0:09:56.405,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Here's one young man who's taken this advice.

188
0:09:58.925,000 --> 0:09:59,000
His name is Matt Weiger.

189
0:10:00.266,000 --> 0:10:03,000
He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,

190
0:10:04.028,000 --> 0:10:07,000
actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis

191
0:10:07.747,000 --> 0:10:09,000
last year when he graduated.

192
0:10:10.126,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But he's gone into finance in New York.

193
0:10:13.352,000 --> 0:10:14,000
He's already earning enough

194
0:10:14.957,000 --> 0:10:18,000
so that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities

195
0:10:19.223,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and still leaving himself with enough to live on.

196
0:10:22.952,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Matt has also helped me to set up an organization

197
0:10:26.823,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that I'm working with that has the name taken

198
0:10:29.876,000 --> 0:10:3,000
from the title of a book I wrote,

199
0:10:31.503,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"The Life You Can Save,"

200
0:10:33.401,000 --> 0:10:35,000
which is trying to change our culture

201
0:10:36.142,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so that more people think that

202
0:10:39.875,000 --> 0:10:4,000
if we're going to live an ethical life,

203
0:10:41.592,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots

204
0:10:45.423,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and not cheat, steal, maim, kill,

205
0:10:47.803,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that

206
0:10:50.69,000 --> 0:10:53,000
with people who have so little.

207
0:10:54.043,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And the organization draws together people

208
0:10:56.822,000 --> 0:10:57,000
of different generations,

209
0:10:58.506,000 --> 0:10:59,000
like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,

210
0:11:00.351,000 --> 0:11:01,000
who's pledged to give 10 percent

211
0:11:01.868,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of the little amount that she has,

212
0:11:03.817,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and on the right, Ada Wan,

213
0:11:05.87,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who has worked directly for the poor, but has now

214
0:11:08.597,000 --> 0:11:12,000
gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.

215
0:11:13.099,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Many people will think, though,

216
0:11:14.624,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that charities aren't really all that effective.

217
0:11:18.606,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So let's talk about effectiveness.

218
0:11:20.399,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Toby Ord is very concerned about this,

219
0:11:22.389,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and he's calculated that some charities

220
0:11:25.276,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are hundreds or even thousands of times

221
0:11:28.065,000 --> 0:11:3,000
more effective than others,

222
0:11:30.123,000 --> 0:11:32,000
so it's very important to find the effective ones.

223
0:11:32.959,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Take, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.

224
0:11:37.99,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That's a good thing to do, right?

225
0:11:40.802,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Well, right, it is a good thing to do,

226
0:11:42.824,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but you have to think what else you could do with the resources.

227
0:11:45.741,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog

228
0:11:49.985,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and train the recipient so that the guide dog

229
0:11:52.481,000 --> 0:11:55,000
can be an effective help to a blind person.

230
0:11:55.865,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars

231
0:12:00.137,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to cure a blind person in a developing country

232
0:12:03.143,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if they have trachoma.

233
0:12:05.153,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So you do the sums, and you get something like that.

234
0:12:08.224,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You could provide one guide dog

235
0:12:09.97,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for one blind American,

236
0:12:12.315,000 --> 0:12:14,000
or you could cure between 400

237
0:12:15.191,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and 2,000 people of blindness.

238
0:12:18.962,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I think it's clear what's the better thing to do.

239
0:12:22.559,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But if you want to look for effective charities,

240
0:12:26.074,000 --> 0:12:28,000
this is a good website to go to.

241
0:12:28.306,000 --> 0:12:32,000
GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,

242
0:12:33.19,000 --> 0:12:34,000
not just whether they're well-run,

243
0:12:35.155,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and it's screened hundreds of charities

244
0:12:37.455,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and currently is recommending only three,

245
0:12:40.754,000 --> 0:12:44,000
of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.

246
0:12:44.987,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,

247
0:12:47.61,000 --> 0:12:5,000
thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can

248
0:12:50.62,000 --> 0:12:52,000
both have a somewhat broader list,

249
0:12:52.986,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but you can find effective organizations,

250
0:12:56.322,000 --> 0:13:,000
and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.

251
0:13:00.498,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website

252
0:13:03.074,000 --> 0:13:06,000
looking at effective animal organizations.

253
0:13:06.506,000 --> 0:13:08,000
That's another cause that I've been concerned about

254
0:13:08.51,000 --> 0:13:1,000
all my life, the immense amount of suffering

255
0:13:11.114,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that humans inflict

256
0:13:12.64,000 --> 0:13:16,000
on literally tens of billions of animals every year.

257
0:13:16.897,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So if you want to look for effective organizations

258
0:13:19.223,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to reduce that suffering,

259
0:13:21.296,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you can go to Effective Animal Activism.

260
0:13:24.297,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And some effective altruists think it's very important

261
0:13:27.336,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to make sure that our species survives at all.

262
0:13:31.093,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.

263
0:13:34.523,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of

264
0:13:37.166,000 --> 0:13:41,000
recently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.

265
0:13:41.323,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Possibly research could help us not only to predict

266
0:13:44.329,000 --> 0:13:45,000
the path of asteroids that might collide with us,

267
0:13:46.3,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but actually to deflect them.

268
0:13:49.092,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So some people think that would be a good thing to give to.

269
0:13:51.756,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There's many possibilities.

270
0:13:53.998,000 --> 0:13:54,000
My final question is,

271
0:13:55.709,000 --> 0:13:58,000
some people will think it's a burden to give.

272
0:13:58.74,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I don't really believe it is.

273
0:14:00.373,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I've enjoyed giving all of my life

274
0:14:02.553,000 --> 0:14:03,000
since I was a graduate student.

275
0:14:03.871,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's been something fulfilling to me.

276
0:14:06.704,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.

277
0:14:09.135,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He thinks that the life he's saving is his own.

278
0:14:12.509,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression

279
0:14:16.436,000 --> 0:14:18,000
until she got involved with effective altruism,

280
0:14:18.668,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and now is one of the happiest people she knows.

281
0:14:22.214,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I think one of the reasons for this

282
0:14:23.987,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome

283
0:14:27.254,000 --> 0:14:29,000
what I call the Sisyphus problem.

284
0:14:30.125,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,

285
0:14:33.318,000 --> 0:14:36,000
condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder

286
0:14:36.341,000 --> 0:14:37,000
up to the top of the hill.

287
0:14:38.02,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Just as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,

288
0:14:41.07,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,

289
0:14:44.311,000 --> 0:14:47,000
he has to trudge back down to push it up again,

290
0:14:47.615,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and the same thing happens again and again

291
0:14:50.034,000 --> 0:14:52,000
for all eternity.

292
0:14:52.416,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,

293
0:14:55.431,000 --> 0:14:57,000
where you work hard to get money,

294
0:14:58.113,000 --> 0:15:,000
you spend that money on consumer goods

295
0:15:00.358,000 --> 0:15:03,000
which you hope you'll enjoy using?

296
0:15:03.93,000 --> 0:15:05,000
But then the money's gone, you have to work hard

297
0:15:06.661,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to get more, spend more, and to maintain

298
0:15:09.561,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.

299
0:15:12.568,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.

300
0:15:15.934,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Becoming an effective altruist gives you

301
0:15:18.926,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that meaning and fulfillment.

302
0:15:20.416,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem

303
0:15:24.607,000 --> 0:15:28,000
on which you can feel your life was really worth living.

304
0:15:28.732,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I'm going to conclude by telling you

305
0:15:31.288,000 --> 0:15:33,000
about an email that I received

306
0:15:33.421,000 --> 0:15:37,000
while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.

307
0:15:38.345,000 --> 0:15:41,000
It's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.

308
0:15:41.372,000 --> 0:15:45,000
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.

309
0:15:45.791,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Why was he recovering from surgery?

310
0:15:48.325,000 --> 0:15:51,000
The email began, "Last Tuesday,

311
0:15:51.882,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.

312
0:15:55.74,000 --> 0:15:57,000
That started a kidney chain

313
0:15:57.825,000 --> 0:16:01,000
which enabled four people to receive kidneys."

314
0:16:02.494,000 --> 0:16:04,000
There's about 100 people each year in the U.S.

315
0:16:04.933,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and more in other countries who do that.

316
0:16:07.651,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say

317
0:16:09.815,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.

318
0:16:13.187,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Well, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,

319
0:16:16.61,000 --> 0:16:22,000
because I still have two kidneys.

320
0:16:22.872,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But Chris went on to say that he didn't think

321
0:16:25.138,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that what he'd done was all that amazing,

322
0:16:27.818,000 --> 0:16:3,000
because he calculated that the number of life-years

323
0:16:31.325,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that he had added to people, the extension of life,

324
0:16:33.873,000 --> 0:16:35,000
was about the same that you could achieve

325
0:16:36.682,000 --> 0:16:41,000
if you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.

326
0:16:42.518,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And that did make me feel a little bit better,

327
0:16:46.594,000 --> 0:16:49,000
because I have given more than 5,000 dollars

328
0:16:50.148,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to the Against Malaria Foundation

329
0:16:52.995,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and to various other effective charities.

330
0:16:57.898,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So if you're feeling bad

331
0:16:59.332,000 --> 0:17:03,000
because you still have two kidneys as well,

332
0:17:03.414,000 --> 0:17:05,000
there's a way for you to get off the hook.

333
0:17:06.048,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Thank you.

334
0:17:07.248,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

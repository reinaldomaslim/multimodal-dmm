1
0:00:16.077,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Whistling)

2
0:02:16.044,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Whistling ends)

3
0:02:19.42,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Applause)

4
0:02:22.763,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Thank you.

5
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Applause)

6
0:02:26.86,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Thank you very much.

7
0:02:28.994,000 --> 0:02:29,000
That was whistling.

8
0:02:30.357,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I'm trying to do this in English.

9
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland --

10
0:02:39.491,000 --> 0:02:4,000
why is he whistling?

11
0:02:41.033,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four.

12
0:02:44.488,000 --> 0:02:46,000
My dad was always whistling around the house,

13
0:02:46.678,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I just thought that's part of communication in my family.

14
0:02:49.769,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I whistled along with him.

15
0:02:51.492,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And actually, until I was 34,

16
0:02:54.979,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling,

17
0:02:59.543,000 --> 0:03:,000
because, to be honest,

18
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior.

19
0:03:05.569,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom,

20
0:03:08.858,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.

21
0:03:11.568,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party

22
0:03:14.972,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with my family-in-law.

23
0:03:16.717,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music.

24
0:03:21.423,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.

25
0:03:25.185,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

26
0:03:26.591,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So when "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it?

27
0:03:30.095,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Whistling)

28
0:03:33.025,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But it can also sound like this.

29
0:03:34.751,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Whistling)

30
0:03:37.898,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But during a Christmas party --

31
0:03:40.88,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying.

32
0:03:43.117,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling."

33
0:03:47.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I just couldn't.

34
0:03:48.912,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And at one point --

35
0:03:50.137,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I had some wine, I have to admit that --

36
0:03:52.373,000 --> 0:03:55,000
at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join."

37
0:03:55.672,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And two weeks later,

38
0:03:57.138,000 --> 0:04:,000
I received a text message: "You're going to America."

39
0:04:00.57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

40
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So, OK, I'm going to America.

41
0:04:05.332,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I would love to, but why?

42
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So I immediately called her up, of course.

43
0:04:09.141,000 --> 0:04:13,000
She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship

44
0:04:13.747,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in America, of course.

45
0:04:15.548,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

46
0:04:17.878,000 --> 0:04:19,000
She didn't expect me to go there.

47
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I would have lost my face.

48
0:04:23.423,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I don't know if that's correct English.

49
0:04:25.433,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.

50
0:04:27.983,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

51
0:04:30.466,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I lost my face.

52
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Applause)

53
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And she thought, "He will never go there."

54
0:04:37.876,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But actually, I did.

55
0:04:39.486,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States,

56
0:04:45.055,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I entered the world of whistling.

57
0:04:48.07,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I also entered the World Championship,

58
0:04:50.604,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and I won there, in 2004.

59
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Applause)

60
0:04:57.196,000 --> 0:05:,000
That was great fun, of course.

61
0:05:01.581,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen --

62
0:05:07.101,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I thought, well let's go back in 2005 --

63
0:05:09.466,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I won again.

64
0:05:10.649,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

65
0:05:12.188,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Then I couldn't participate for a few years.

66
0:05:14.309,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.

67
0:05:18.875,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So what happened now

68
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage,

69
0:05:25.1,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I'm talking about whistling.

70
0:05:27.034,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment.

71
0:05:30.537,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So I quit my day job as a nurse.

72
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

73
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I try to live my dream --

74
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.

75
0:05:43.429,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

76
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.

77
0:05:47.577,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"

78
0:05:49.726,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Well actually, you are going to whistle along.

79
0:05:55.736,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And then always the same thing happens:

80
0:05:58.198,000 --> 0:06:,000
people are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God.

81
0:06:00.996,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Why? Can I go away?"

82
0:06:03.174,000 --> 0:06:04,000
No, you can't.

83
0:06:04.607,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

84
0:06:07.106,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Actually, it's very simple.

85
0:06:08.478,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."

86
0:06:12.414,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's about 80 minutes long.

87
0:06:14.255,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

88
0:06:15.684,000 --> 0:06:17,000
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.

89
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling.

90
0:06:22.427,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Yes, so I whistle the tone.

91
0:06:24.203,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Whistling)

92
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

93
0:06:28.608,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Sorry, I forgot one thing --

94
0:06:31.423,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you whistle the same tone as me.

95
0:06:34.016,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

96
0:06:35.889,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I heard a wide variety of tones.

97
0:06:42.05,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)

98
0:06:55.359,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Whistling ends)

99
0:06:56.589,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is very promising.

100
0:06:57.972,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:59.183,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is very promising.

102
0:07:00.548,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I'll ask the technicians to start the music.

103
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along,

104
0:07:06.522,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we will see what happens.

105
0:07:08.119,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

106
0:07:13.883,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.

107
0:07:17.93,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

108
0:07:22.183,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I'm so used to that.

109
0:07:23.405,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

110
0:07:24.453,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I start it myself.

111
0:07:25.802,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

112
0:07:26.987,000 --> 0:07:27,000
OK, here it is.

113
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

114
0:07:31.633,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Music)

115
0:07:33.603,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Whistling)

116
0:07:44.368,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Whistling ends)

117
0:07:45.543,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Music)

118
0:07:49.582,000 --> 0:07:5,000
OK.

119
0:07:51.686,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Whistling)

120
0:08:39.079,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It's easy, isn't it?

121
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Whistling)

122
0:09:15.609,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now comes the solo, I propose I do that myself, OK?

123
0:09:18.633,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Music)

124
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Whistling)

125
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Applause)

126
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion of Whistling.

127
0:11:49.013,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.

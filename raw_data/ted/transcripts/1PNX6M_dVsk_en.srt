1
0:00:12.12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I'm going to talk about trust,

2
0:00:14.215,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I'm going to start by reminding you

3
0:00:16.495,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of the standard views that people have about trust.

4
0:00:20.576,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think these are so commonplace,

5
0:00:22.815,000 --> 0:00:24,000
they've become clichés of our society.

6
0:00:25.103,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I think there are three.

7
0:00:27.129,000 --> 0:00:31,000
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,

8
0:00:31.961,000 --> 0:00:32,000
very widely believed.

9
0:00:33.869,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.

10
0:00:38.376,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.

11
0:00:43.866,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I think that the claim, the aim and the task

12
0:00:48.204,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are all misconceived.

13
0:00:50.374,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So what I'm going to try to tell you today

14
0:00:52.023,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task

15
0:00:56.713,000 --> 0:01:,000
which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.

16
0:01:01.34,000 --> 0:01:05,000
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?

17
0:01:06.106,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,

18
0:01:09.907,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I don't know the answer.

19
0:01:11.681,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm inclined to think it may have declined

20
0:01:15.49,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in some activities or some institutions

21
0:01:18.996,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and it might have grown in others.

22
0:01:20.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I don't have an overview.

23
0:01:22.744,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,

24
0:01:27.081,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the opinion polls are supposedly

25
0:01:29.449,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the source of a belief that trust has declined.

26
0:01:33.401,000 --> 0:01:36,000
When you actually look at opinion polls across time,

27
0:01:37.258,000 --> 0:01:38,000
there's not much evidence for that.

28
0:01:39.056,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted

29
0:01:41.646,000 --> 0:01:42,000
20 years ago,

30
0:01:43.257,000 --> 0:01:47,000
principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.

31
0:01:47.81,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago

32
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:54,000
are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.

33
0:01:54.625,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The rest of us are in between,

34
0:01:56.529,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and by the way, the average person in the street

35
0:01:59.599,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is almost exactly midway.

36
0:02:01.623,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But is that good evidence?

37
0:02:03.856,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.

38
0:02:08.012,000 --> 0:02:09,000
What else can they record?

39
0:02:09.579,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So they're looking at the generic attitudes

40
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that people report when you ask them certain questions.

41
0:02:16.659,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?

42
0:02:20.589,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?

43
0:02:24.221,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Do you trust fishmongers?

44
0:02:26.118,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"

45
0:02:28.75,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"

46
0:02:32.341,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.

47
0:02:35.555,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,

48
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Well, I trust some of them, but not others."

49
0:02:44.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That's a perfectly rational thing.

50
0:02:46.038,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In short, in our real lives,

51
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.

52
0:02:52.81,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust

53
0:02:56.386,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that we will have in every instance of a certain type

54
0:02:59.882,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of official or office-holder or type of person

55
0:03:03.797,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is going to be uniform.

56
0:03:05.742,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust

57
0:03:09.465,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a certain elementary school teacher I know

58
0:03:11.91,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to teach the reception class to read,

59
0:03:14.536,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but in no way to drive the school minibus.

60
0:03:18.184,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.

61
0:03:21.285,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I might trust my most loquacious friend

62
0:03:24.562,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to keep a conversation going

63
0:03:26.654,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.

64
0:03:36.313,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Simple.

65
0:03:37.562,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives

66
0:03:42.468,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the way that trust is differentiated,

67
0:03:44.584,000 --> 0:03:47,000
why do we sort of drop all that intelligence

68
0:03:47.835,000 --> 0:03:5,000
when we think about trust more abstractly?

69
0:03:51.458,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I think the polls are very bad guides

70
0:03:54.202,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to the level of trust that actually exists,

71
0:03:57.259,000 --> 0:04:,000
because they try to obliterate the good judgment

72
0:04:00.831,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that goes into placing trust.

73
0:04:04.238,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Secondly, what about the aim?

74
0:04:06.43,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The aim is to have more trust.

75
0:04:09.05,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.

76
0:04:12.379,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's not what I would aim at.

77
0:04:14.326,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy

78
0:04:17.789,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but not in the untrustworthy.

79
0:04:20.806,000 --> 0:04:26,000
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.

80
0:04:27.348,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I think, of those people who, for example,

81
0:04:30.96,000 --> 0:04:34,000
placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,

82
0:04:35.661,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who then made off with them,

83
0:04:38.3,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,

84
0:04:40.63,000 --> 0:04:41,000
too much trust.

85
0:04:42.493,000 --> 0:04:45,000
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.

86
0:04:46.35,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust

87
0:04:50.344,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is the proper aim.

88
0:04:52.811,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,

89
0:04:56.274,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that means that what matters in the first place

90
0:04:59.418,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is not trust but trustworthiness.

91
0:05:02.559,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's judging how trustworthy people are

92
0:05:05.477,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in particular respects.

93
0:05:07.406,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.

94
0:05:10.754,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?

95
0:05:15.966,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And if we find that a person is competent

96
0:05:18.038,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in the relevant matters,

97
0:05:19.774,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and reliable and honest,

98
0:05:21.695,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,

99
0:05:23.989,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because they'll be trustworthy.

100
0:05:26.2,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.

101
0:05:29.866,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I have friends who are competent and honest,

102
0:05:32.11,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but I would not trust them to post a letter,

103
0:05:33.897,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because they're forgetful.

104
0:05:36.469,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I have friends who are very confident

105
0:05:39.141,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they can do certain things,

106
0:05:41.104,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.

107
0:05:45.512,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends

108
0:05:48.167,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.

109
0:05:51.801,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:52.641,000 --> 0:05:55,000
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.

111
0:05:56.028,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But that's what we're looking for:

112
0:05:58.322,000 --> 0:06:,000
trustworthiness before trust.

113
0:06:00.52,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Trust is the response.

114
0:06:02.428,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.

115
0:06:04.768,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And, of course, it's difficult.

116
0:06:06.499,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct

117
0:06:09.848,000 --> 0:06:12,000
systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions

118
0:06:13.121,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and professionals and officials and so on

119
0:06:15.217,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.

120
0:06:19.823,000 --> 0:06:22,000
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.

121
0:06:23.095,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They don't work as they're supposed to.

122
0:06:24.971,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,

123
0:06:29.386,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer

124
0:06:31.718,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."

125
0:06:35.219,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And all over our public life, our institutional life,

126
0:06:38.99,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we find that problem,

127
0:06:40.84,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that the system of accountability

128
0:06:43.253,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that is meant to secure trustworthiness

129
0:06:45.582,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and evidence of trustworthiness

130
0:06:48.332,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is actually doing the opposite.

131
0:06:50.196,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,

132
0:06:54.833,000 --> 0:06:56,000
like midwives, from doing them

133
0:06:57.146,000 --> 0:06:59,000
by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.

134
0:07:00.104,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You can all give your own examples there.

135
0:07:02.838,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So so much for the aim.

136
0:07:04.748,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,

137
0:07:07.638,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and that is going to be different

138
0:07:09.797,000 --> 0:07:1,000
if we are trying to be trustworthy

139
0:07:11.746,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,

140
0:07:14.772,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and if we are trying to judge whether other people

141
0:07:17.676,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.

142
0:07:20.848,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,

143
0:07:25.222,000 --> 0:07:29,000
attitudes, don't do adequately here.

144
0:07:30.084,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now thirdly, the task.

145
0:07:33.649,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,

146
0:07:37.221,000 --> 0:07:38,000
also gets things backwards.

147
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.

148
0:07:43.815,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Well, we can do that for ourselves.

149
0:07:46.268,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.

150
0:07:48.666,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.

151
0:07:52.298,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But trust, in the end, is distinctive

152
0:07:55.502,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because it's given by other people.

153
0:07:58.262,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You can't rebuild what other people give you.

154
0:08:01.439,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You have to give them the basis

155
0:08:04.166,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for giving you their trust.

156
0:08:07.349,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.

157
0:08:10.541,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And that, of course, is because you can't fool

158
0:08:12.925,000 --> 0:08:15,000
all of the people all of the time, usually.

159
0:08:16.511,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But you also have to provide usable evidence

160
0:08:21.157,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that you are trustworthy.

161
0:08:22.711,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How to do it?

162
0:08:24.253,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done

163
0:08:27.463,000 --> 0:08:3,000
by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,

164
0:08:30.477,000 --> 0:08:31,000
quite effectively.

165
0:08:32.317,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Let me give you a simple commercial example.

166
0:08:35.83,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,

167
0:08:39.72,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and they don't ask any questions.

168
0:08:41.972,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They take them back and give me the money

169
0:08:43.733,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.

170
0:08:46.365,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That's super. I trust them

171
0:08:48.554,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.

172
0:08:51.885,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I think there's a big lesson in that.

173
0:08:53.878,000 --> 0:08:56,000
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,

174
0:08:56.932,000 --> 0:08:59,000
then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy

175
0:09:00.835,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and you have confidence in what you are saying.

176
0:09:03.853,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for

177
0:09:06.025,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is not very difficult to discern.

178
0:09:09.565,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy

179
0:09:13.77,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and can judge when and how the other person

180
0:09:17.645,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is trustworthy.

181
0:09:18.933,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So the moral of all this is,

182
0:09:22.791,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we need to think much less about trust,

183
0:09:25.945,000 --> 0:09:28,000
let alone about attitudes of trust

184
0:09:29.48,000 --> 0:09:32,000
detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,

185
0:09:33.166,000 --> 0:09:35,000
much more about being trustworthy,

186
0:09:35.78,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and how you give people adequate, useful

187
0:09:39.685,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.

188
0:09:42.429,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Thanks.

189
0:09:43.49,000 --> 0:09:45,000

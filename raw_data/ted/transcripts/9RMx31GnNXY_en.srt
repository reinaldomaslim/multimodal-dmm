1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There's actually a major health crisis today

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in terms of the shortage of organs.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The fact is that we're living longer.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Medicine has done a much better job

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of making us live longer,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the problem is, as we age,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
our organs tend to fail more,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and so currently

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
there are not enough organs to go around.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In fact, in the last 10 years,

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
while in the same time,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So this is now a public health crisis.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So that's where this field comes in

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we call the field of regenerative medicine.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It really involves many different areas.

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You can use, actually, scaffolds,

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
biomaterials --

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but specific materials you can actually implant in patients

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and they will do well and help you regenerate.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Or we can use cells alone,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
either your very own cells

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or different stem cell populations.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Or we can use both.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We can use, actually, biomaterials

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and the cells together.

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And that's where the field is today.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But it's actually not a new field.

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Interestingly, this is a book

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that was published back in 1938.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He actually devised some of the same technologies

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
used today for suturing blood vessels,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
were actually designed by Alexis.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But I want you to note his co-author:

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Charles Lindbergh.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That's the same Charles Lindbergh

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
who actually spent the rest of his life

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
working with Alexis

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at the Rockefeller Institute in New York

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in the area of the culture of organs.

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So if the field's been around for so long,

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
why so few clinical advances?

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And that really has to do to many different challenges.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But if I were to point to three challenges,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the first one is actually the design of materials

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that could go in your body

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and do well over time.

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And many advances now,

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we can do that fairly readily.

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The second challenge was cells.

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.

57
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells.

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Plus we have stem cells.

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But even now, 2011,

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we still can't grow them even today.

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And the third challenge is vascularity,

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the actual supply of blood

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to allow those organs or tissues to survive

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
once we regenerate them.

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we can actually use biomaterials now.

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is actually a biomaterial.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This is actually like a cotton candy machine.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You saw the spray going in.

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
creating this structure, this tubularized structure,

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which is a biomaterial

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we can then use

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to help your body regenerate

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
using your very own cells to do so.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And that's exactly what we did here.

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is actually a patient

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
who [was] presented with a deceased organ,

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and we then created one of these smart biomaterials,

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then we then used that smart biomaterial

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to replace and repair

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that patient's structure.

86
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What we did was we actually

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
used the biomaterial as a bridge

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so that the cells in the organ

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
could walk on that bridge, if you will,

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and help to bridge the gap

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to regenerate that tissue.

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And you see that patient now six months after

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is fully regenerated

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
when you analyze it under the microscope.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We can also use cells alone.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These are actually cells that we obtained.

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
These are stem cells that we create from specific sources,

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and we can drive them to become heart cells,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and they start beating in culture.

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So they know what to do.

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The cells genetically know what to do,

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they start beating together.

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now today, many clinical trials

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
are using different kinds of stem cells

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for heart disease.

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So that's actually now in patients.

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Or if we're going to use larger structures

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to replace larger structures,

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we can then use the patient's own cells,

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or some cell population,

112
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and the biomaterials,

113
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the scaffolds, together.

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the concept here:

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so if you do have a deceased or injured organ,

116
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we take a very small piece of that tissue,

117
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

118
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We then tease the cells apart,

119
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we grow the cells outside the body.

120
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --

122
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we then shape that material,

123
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and we then use those cells to coat that material

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
one layer at a time --

125
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

126
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We then place it in an oven-like device,

127
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and we're able to create that structure

128
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and bring it out.

129
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This is actually a heart valve

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that we've engineered,

131
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve

132
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we've seeded that with cells,

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and then we exercise it.

134
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So you see the leaflets opening and closing --

135
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of this heart valve

136
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that's currently being used experimentally

137
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to try to get it to further studies.

138
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Another technology

139
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that we have used in patients

140
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
actually involves bladders.

141
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --

142
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We then grow the cells outside the body,

144
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --

145
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the patient's own cells, two different cell types.

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We then put it in this oven-like device.

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It has the same conditions as the human body --

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that we're able to implant back into the patient.

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis,

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but we actually created these biomaterials by hand.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But we now have better ways

155
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to create these structures with the cells.

156
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We use now some type of technologies,

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
where for solid organs, for example,

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
like the liver,

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
what we do is we take discard livers.

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.

161
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So we can take these liver structures,

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which are not going to be used,

163
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure

164
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that will allow the cells to be washed away.

165
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Two weeks later,

166
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you have something that looks like a liver.

167
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You can hold it like a liver,

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,

170
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
preserving the blood vessel tree.

171
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree

172
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
with the patient's own blood vessel cells,

173
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And we now have been able just to show

175
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the creation of human liver tissue

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
just this past month

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
using this technology.

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Another technology that we've used

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is actually that of printing.

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer,

181
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but instead of using ink,

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we're using cells.

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And you can actually see here the printhead

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
going through and printing this structure,

185
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.

186
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And there's a 3D elevator

187
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that then actually goes down one layer at a time

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
each time the printhead goes through.

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And then finally you're able to get that structure out.

190
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.

191
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And this is actually a piece of bone

192
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that I'm going to show you in this slide

193
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that was actually created with this desktop printer

194
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and implanted as you see here.

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That was all new bone that was implanted

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
using these techniques.

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now,

198
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
our next generation of technologies,

199
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
are more sophisticated printers.

200
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This particular printer we're designing now

201
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is actually one where we print right on the patient.

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So what you see here --

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I know it sounds funny,

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but that's the way it works.

205
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Because in reality, what you want to do

206
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and you have a scanner,

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
basically like a flatbed scanner.

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That's what you see here on the right side.

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You see a scanner technology

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that first scans the wound on the patient

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and then it comes back with the printheads

213
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
actually printing the layers that you require

214
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
on the patients themselves.

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This is how it actually works.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Here's the scanner going through,

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
scanning the wound.

218
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Once it's scanned,

219
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it sends information in the correct layers of cells

220
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
where they need to be.

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And now you're going to see here

222
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
a demo of this actually being done

223
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in a representative wound.

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So once those cells are on the patient

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they will stick where they need to be.

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And this is actually new technology

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
still under development.

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We're also working on more sophisticated printers.

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Because in reality, our biggest challenge

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
are the solid organs.

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I don't know if you realize this,

233
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
are actually waiting for a kidney.

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Patients are dying every day

236
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because we don't have enough of those organs to go around.

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So this is more challenging --

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
large organ, vascular,

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a lot of blood vessel supply,

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a lot of cells present.

241
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So the strategy here is --

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --

243
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and we go layer by layer,

244
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
using computerized morphometric imaging analysis

245
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and 3D reconstruction

246
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to get right down to those patient's own kidneys.

247
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We then are able to actually image those,

248
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
do 360 degree rotation

249
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to analyze the kidney

250
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in its full volumetric characteristics,

251
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and we then are able

252
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to actually take this information

253
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and then scan this

254
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in a printing computerized form.

255
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So we go layer by layer through the organ,

256
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
analyzing each layer as we go through the organ,

257
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and we then are able to send that information, as you see here,

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
through the computer

259
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and actually design the organ

260
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for the patient.

261
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This actually shows the actual printer.

262
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And this actually shows that printing.

263
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In fact, we actually have the printer right here.

264
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So while we've been talking today,

265
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you can actually see the printer

266
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
back here in the back stage.

267
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's actually the actual printer right now,

268
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and that's been printing this kidney structure

269
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that you see here.

270
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It takes about seven hours to print a kidney,

271
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
so this is about three hours into it now.

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,

273
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that we printed a little bit earlier today.

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Put a pair of gloves here.

276
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Thank you.

277
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Go backwards.

278
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.

279
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
You can actually see that kidney

280
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
as it was printed earlier today.

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

282
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Has a little bit of consistency to it.

283
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,

284
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and part of our team.

285
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.

286
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Applause)

287
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So this is actually a new generation.

288
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.

289
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now.

290
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In reality, we now have a long history of doing this.

291
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I'm going to share with you a clip

292
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.

293
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And this is actually a very brief clip --

294
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
only about 30 seconds --

295
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of a patient who actually received an organ.

296
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.

297
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.

298
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I couldn't go out

299
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and play basketball at recess

300
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
without feeling like I was going to pass out

301
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
when I got back inside.

302
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I felt so sick.

303
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,

304
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like

305
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
if I was on that.

306
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So after the surgery,

307
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
life got a lot better for me.

308
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I was able to do more things.

309
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I was able to wrestle in high school.

310
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I became the captain of the team, and that was great.

311
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.

312
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder,

313
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it's going to be with me.

314
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I've got it for life, so I'm all set.

315
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

316
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,

317
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and it's very cool when they do.

318
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Luke, come up please.

319
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

320
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So Luke, before last night,

321
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
when's the last time you saw Tony?

322
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --

323
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and it's really great to see him.

324
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

325
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Applause)

326
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.

327
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.

328
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,

329
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and basically trying to live life like a normal kid,

330
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
which I always wanted growing up.

331
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida

332
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and my kidneys and bladder weren't working.

333
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I went through about 16 surgeries,

334
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and it seemed impossible to do that

335
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
when I was in kidney failure when I was 10.

336
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And this surgery came along

337
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and basically made me who I am today

338
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and saved my life.

339
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Applause)

340
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?

341
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab

342
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and coming up with crazy stuff.

343
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.

344
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.

345
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I was a little kid, and I was like,

346
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."

347
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
(Laughter)

348
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
All I wanted to do was to get better,

349
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older

350
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and I see the amazing things that he's doing.

351
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
JE: When you got this call out of the blue --

352
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Tony's really shy,

353
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and it took a lot of convincing

354
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to get somebody as modest as Tony

355
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to allow us to bring Luke.

356
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So Luke, you go to your communications professors --

357
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
you're majoring in communications --

358
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and you ask them for permission to come to TED,

359
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
which might have a little bit to do with communications,

360
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and what was their reaction?

361
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
LM: Most of my professors were all for it,

362
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and they said, "Bring pictures

363
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."

364
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
There were a couple that were a little stubborn,

365
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but I had to talk to them.

366
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I pulled them aside.

367
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.

368
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)

369
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
JE: Thank you, Tony.

370
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

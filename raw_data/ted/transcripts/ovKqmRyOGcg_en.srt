1
0:00:12.861,000 --> 0:00:13,000
We're holding hands,

2
0:00:14.668,000 --> 0:00:15,000
staring at the door.

3
0:00:16.374,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My siblings and I were waiting for my mother to come back

4
0:00:19.336,000 --> 0:00:2,000
from the hospital.

5
0:00:20.822,000 --> 0:00:23,000
She was there because my grandmother had cancer surgery that day.

6
0:00:26.496,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Finally, the doors opened,

7
0:00:29.264,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and she said,

8
0:00:30.622,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"She's gone.

9
0:00:31.854,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She's gone."

10
0:00:33.672,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She started sobbing and immediately said,

11
0:00:36.334,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"We must make arrangements.

12
0:00:38.548,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Your grandmother's dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea."

13
0:00:46.193,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was barely 12 years old, and when the shock wore off,

14
0:00:50.026,000 --> 0:00:53,000
my mother's words were ringing in my ears.

15
0:00:53.661,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My grandmother wanted to be buried back home.

16
0:00:58.589,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We had moved from Korea to Argentina six years prior,

17
0:01:04.39,000 --> 0:01:07,000
without knowing any Spanish, or how we were going to make a living.

18
0:01:09.076,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And upon arrival, we were immigrants who had lost everything,

19
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so we had to work really hard to rebuild our lives.

20
0:01:16.831,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So it hadn't occurred to me that after all these years,

21
0:01:20.479,000 --> 0:01:22,000
back home was still in Korea.

22
0:01:24.635,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It made me ponder where I would want to be buried someday,

23
0:01:28.673,000 --> 0:01:29,000
where home was for me,

24
0:01:30.592,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and the answer was not obvious.

25
0:01:33.183,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And this really bothered me.

26
0:01:36.736,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So this episode launched a lifelong quest for my identity.

27
0:01:43.174,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was born in Korea -- the land of kimchi;

28
0:01:46.77,000 --> 0:01:47,000
raised in Argentina,

29
0:01:48.628,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now;

30
0:01:54.319,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I was educated in the US,

31
0:01:56.461,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where I became addicted to peanut butter.

32
0:01:59.086,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:00.41,000 --> 0:02:03,000
During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian,

34
0:02:04.368,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but my looks betrayed me at times.

35
0:02:07.052,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I remember on the first day of middle school,

36
0:02:10.346,000 --> 0:02:12,000
my Spanish literature teacher came into the room.

37
0:02:13.078,000 --> 0:02:14,000
She scanned all of my classmates,

38
0:02:15.089,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and she said,

39
0:02:16.288,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"You -- you have to get a tutor,

40
0:02:18.861,000 --> 0:02:2,000
otherwise, you won't pass this class."

41
0:02:21.744,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But by then I was fluent in Spanish already,

42
0:02:25.63,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian,

43
0:02:31.27,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but not both.

44
0:02:33.156,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It felt like a zero-sum game,

45
0:02:35.263,000 --> 0:02:37,000
where I had to give up my old identity

46
0:02:38.224,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to be able to gain or earn a new one.

47
0:02:43.255,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So when I was 18, I decided to go to Korea,

48
0:02:47.408,000 --> 0:02:51,000
hoping that finally I could find a place to call home.

49
0:02:51.486,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But there people asked me,

50
0:02:53.507,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent?"

51
0:02:56.927,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:57.975,000 --> 0:03:,000
And, "You must be Japanese because of your big eyes

53
0:03:01.494,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and your foreign body language."

54
0:03:04.101,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian,

55
0:03:08.948,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but too Argentinian to be Korean.

56
0:03:11.97,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And this was a pivotal realization to me.

57
0:03:15.848,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I had failed to find that place in the world to call home.

58
0:03:20.621,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But how many Japanese-looking Koreans who speak with a Spanish accent --

59
0:03:26.165,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or even more specific, Argentinian accent --

60
0:03:29.188,000 --> 0:03:3,000
do you think are out there?

61
0:03:31.229,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Perhaps this could be an advantage.

62
0:03:34.777,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It was easy for me to stand out,

63
0:03:36.903,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which couldn't hurt in a world that was rapidly changing,

64
0:03:40.255,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where skills could become obsolete overnight.

65
0:03:43.892,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So I stopped looking for that 100 percent commonality

66
0:03:50.09,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with the people that I met.

67
0:03:51.61,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Instead, I realized that oftentimes, I was the only overlap

68
0:03:58.071,000 --> 0:04:02,000
between groups of people that were usually in conflict with each other.

69
0:04:03.13,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So with this realization in mind,

70
0:04:06.072,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself --

71
0:04:10.289,000 --> 0:04:14,000
even allow myself to reinvent myself at times.

72
0:04:15.393,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So for example, in high school,

73
0:04:18.69,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.

74
0:04:20.724,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I had no sense of fashion -- thick glasses, simple hairstyle --

75
0:04:24.351,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you can get the idea.

76
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I think, actually, I only had friends because I shared my homework.

77
0:04:30.037,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That's the truth.

78
0:04:31.627,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But once at university,

79
0:04:33.683,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I was able to find a new identity for myself,

80
0:04:37.401,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and the nerd became a popular girl.

81
0:04:42.036,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But it was MIT,

82
0:04:43.246,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so I don't know if I can take too much credit for that.

83
0:04:45.925,000 --> 0:04:46,000
As they say over there,

84
0:04:47.554,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"The odds are good,

85
0:04:49.905,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but the goods are odd."

86
0:04:52.7,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:55.049,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I switched majors so many times that my advisors joked

88
0:04:58.857,000 --> 0:05:,000
that I should get a degree in "random studies."

89
0:05:02.164,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:03.923,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I told this to my kids.

91
0:05:05.227,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then over the years, I have gained a lot of different identities.

92
0:05:10.544,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I started as an inventor, entrepreneur, social innovator.

93
0:05:14.426,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Then I became an investor,

94
0:05:17.718,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a woman in tech,

95
0:05:18.964,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a teacher.

96
0:05:20.247,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And most recently, I became a mom,

97
0:05:23.217,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or as my toddler says repeatedly,

98
0:05:26.647,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Mom!" day and night.

99
0:05:30.978,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Even my accent was so confused --

100
0:05:35.739,000 --> 0:05:37,000
its origin was so obscure,

101
0:05:38.215,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that my friends called it, "Rebecanese."

102
0:05:41.492,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:43.236,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But reinventing yourself can be very hard.

104
0:05:46.186,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You can face a lot of resistance at times.

105
0:05:49.391,000 --> 0:05:52,000
When I was nearly done with my PhD,

106
0:05:52.93,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug.

107
0:05:55.444,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I was in Silicon Valley,

108
0:05:57.194,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and so writing a thesis in the basement didn't seem as interesting

109
0:06:02.555,000 --> 0:06:03,000
as starting my own company.

110
0:06:04.452,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So I went to my very traditional Korean parents,

111
0:06:07.65,000 --> 0:06:08,000
who are here today,

112
0:06:09.11,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with the task of letting them know

113
0:06:10.785,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that I was going to drop out from my PhD program.

114
0:06:14.227,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You see, my siblings and I are the first generation to go to university,

115
0:06:18.993,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so for a family of immigrants, this was kind of a big deal.

116
0:06:22.447,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You can imagine how this conversation was going to go.

117
0:06:26.125,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But fortunately, I had a secret weapon with me,

118
0:06:30.028,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which was a chart that had the average income of all of the graduates

119
0:06:36.926,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from Stanford PhD programs,

120
0:06:39.208,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and then the average income of all the dropouts

121
0:06:42.731,000 --> 0:06:43,000
from Stanford graduate programs.

122
0:06:44.521,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:45.706,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I must tell you -- this chart was definitely skewed

124
0:06:48.228,000 --> 0:06:49,000
by the founders of Google.

125
0:06:49.783,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:50.83,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But my mom looked at the chart,

127
0:06:52.942,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and she said,

128
0:06:54.207,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Oh, for you -- follow your passion."

129
0:06:57.527,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:59.485,000 --> 0:07:,000
Hi, Mom.

131
0:07:02.132,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now, today my identity quest is no longer to find my tribe.

132
0:07:08.68,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's more about allowing myself

133
0:07:11.168,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself

134
0:07:15.305,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and cultivating diversity within me

135
0:07:20.561,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and not just around me.

136
0:07:23.563,000 --> 0:07:26,000
My boys now are three years and five months old today,

137
0:07:27.406,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and they were already born with three nationalities

138
0:07:30.896,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and four languages.

139
0:07:32.919,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I should mention now that my husband is actually from Denmark --

140
0:07:37.56,000 --> 0:07:39,000
just in case I don't have enough culture shocks in my life,

141
0:07:40.413,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I decided to marry a Danish guy.

142
0:07:42.453,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In fact, I think my kids will be the first Vikings

143
0:07:45.453,000 --> 0:07:48,000
who will have a hard time growing a beard when they become older.

144
0:07:48.985,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:50.317,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Yeah, we'll have to work on that.

146
0:07:51.937,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But I really hope that they will find that their multiplicity

147
0:07:58.323,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is going to open and create a lot of doors for them in their lives,

148
0:08:01.753,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and that they can use this as a way to find commonality

149
0:08:05.743,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in a world that's increasingly global today.

150
0:08:10.38,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried

151
0:08:14.515,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that they don't fit in that one box

152
0:08:16.619,000 --> 0:08:19,000
or that their identity will become irrelevant someday,

153
0:08:20.369,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that they can feel free to experiment

154
0:08:23.158,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and to take control of their personal narrative and identity.

155
0:08:29.371,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I also hope that they will use their unique combination

156
0:08:32.516,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of values and languages and cultures and skills

157
0:08:37.849,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to help create a world

158
0:08:39.523,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where identities are no longer used to alienate what looks different,

159
0:08:45.324,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but rather, to bring together people.

160
0:08:49.75,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And most importantly, I really hope that they find tremendous joy

161
0:08:53.414,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in going through these uncharted territories,

162
0:08:57.592,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because I know I have.

163
0:09:01.569,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now, as for my grandmother,

164
0:09:04.225,000 --> 0:09:08,000
her last wish was also her last lesson to me.

165
0:09:09.088,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea

166
0:09:13.709,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and being buried there.

167
0:09:15.382,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It was about resting next to her son,

168
0:09:19.075,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who had died long before she moved to Argentina.

169
0:09:23.714,000 --> 0:09:26,000
What mattered to her was not the ocean

170
0:09:27.613,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that divided her past and new world;

171
0:09:32.098,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it was about finding common ground.

172
0:09:37.897,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Thank you.

173
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

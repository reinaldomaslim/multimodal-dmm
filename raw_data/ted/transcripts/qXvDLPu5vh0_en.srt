1
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I've been doing it for two years,

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
trying to change how we feed kids in America.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Everyone says it couldn't be done.

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like, what my vision would be.

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
How do we really change children's relationship to food?

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I'll tell you why we need to change it,

18
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but we absolutely have to change it.

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And what I came to understand is,

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we needed to teach children

21
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the symbiotic relationship

22
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
although we've heard otherwise,

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is we're really going to become extinct,

26
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because we're feeding our children to death.

27
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That's my premise.

28
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.

29
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the reason this is happening, by and large,

30
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is because of our food system

31
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the way the government commodifies food,

32
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the way the government oversees our food,

33
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates

34
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.

35
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,

36
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school

37
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and tell them to learn, you know,

38
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
learn what's in those schools.

39
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And when you feed these kids bad food,

40
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.

41
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.

42
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide,

43
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,

44
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.

45
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.

46
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
These are -- 10 companies

47
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
control much of what's in our grocery stores,

48
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.

49
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So when I started thinking about these issues

50
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and how I was going to change what kids ate,

51
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I really started focusing on what we would teach them.

52
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the very first thing

53
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
was about regional food -- trying to eat food

54
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
from within our region.

55
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,

56
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,

57
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as oil hits its peak oil,

58
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not

59
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we should, or could, be moving food

60
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
1,500 miles before we eat it.

61
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So we talked to kids about that,

62
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we really start to feed kids regional food.

63
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then we talk about organic food.

64
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,

65
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but we, as a nation,

66
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
have to start thinking about

67
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
consuming, growing and feeding our children

68
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
food that's not chock-full of chemicals.

69
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides

70
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.

71
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We can't keep doing that.

72
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You know, it doesn't work.

73
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And the results of that are kids getting sick.

74
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.

75
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America

76
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is consumed in animal husbandry.

77
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We are feeding our kids antibiotics

78
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in beef and other animal protein every day.

79
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.

80
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And the result of it is, we have diseases.

81
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,

82
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that we can't make kids better when they get sick.

83
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,

84
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but it's an issue in the food supply.

85
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
One of my favorite facts is that

86
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.

87
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That means every one of us, and our children,

88
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --

89
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
those bags you have at home. If I had one here

90
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and ripped it open,

91
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that pile I would have on the floor

92
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is what we consume and feed our children every year

93
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because of what goes into our food supply,

94
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because of the way we consume

95
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
produce in America.

96
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The USDA allows these antibiotics,

97
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,

98
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and the USDA paid for this ad

99
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in Time magazine.

100
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,

101
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but we know it wasn't good for you and me.

102
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.

103
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And that has to change, you know.

104
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The USDA cannot be seen as

105
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the be-all and end-all of what we feed

106
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
our kids and what's allowed.

107
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.

108
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.

109
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That's what I really try and get people to understand.

110
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.

111
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's consuming food in a way

112
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in which we'll still have a planet,

113
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in which kids will grow up to be healthy,

114
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and which really tries to mitigate

115
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
all the negative impacts we're seeing.

116
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It really is just a new idea.

117
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I mean, people toss around sustainability,

118
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but we have to figure out what sustainability is.

119
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,

120
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we've gone from being 200 --

121
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers

122
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to less than 2 percent of farmers.

123
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --

124
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.

125
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And we spend 35,000 dollars

126
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,

127
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and school districts spend 500 dollars a year

128
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
feeding a child.

129
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.

130
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And what's happening is, we're getting sick.

132
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.

133
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It is about what we feed them.

134
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What goes in is what we are.

135
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We really are what we eat.

136
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And if we continue down this path,

137
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if we continue to feed kids bad food,

138
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
if we continue not to teach them what good food is,

139
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?

140
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
What's going to happen to our whole medical system?

141
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What's going to happen is,

142
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we're going to have kids

143
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that have a life less long than our own.

144
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,

145
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --

146
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
those seven- and eight-year-olds today --

147
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
one out of every three Caucasians,

148
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics

149
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.

150
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,

151
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
most before they graduate high school.

152
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This means that 40 or 45 percent

153
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of all school-aged children

154
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
could be insulin-dependent

155
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
within a decade. Within a decade.

156
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
What's going to happen?

157
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Well, the CDC has gone further to say

158
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that those children born in the year 2000

159
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
could be the first generation

160
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.

161
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And it's because of what we feed them.

162
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide --

163
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and if they do, you should be in therapy.

164
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You know, we are responsible

165
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for what kids eat.

166
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.

167
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year

168
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.

169
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.

170
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They spend 500 dollars

171
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods

172
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar

173
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
marketing healthy, nutritious food.

174
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The result of which is kids think they're going to die

175
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
if they don't have chicken nuggets.

176
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.

177
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.

178
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,

179
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is what McDonald's and Burger King

180
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and those big companies think we should eat.

181
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And why can they serve that much?

182
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps

183
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and 99-cent double burgers?

184
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's because of the way the government commodifies food,

185
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the cheap corn and cheap soy

186
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that are pushed into our food supply

187
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that makes these non-nutrient foods

188
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
really, really cheap.

189
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.

190
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,

191
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."

192
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.

193
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is not even food.

194
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,

195
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
corn dogs,

196
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.

197
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.

198
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.

199
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen

200
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,

201
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it came frozen in a box.

202
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The USDA allows this.

203
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The USDA allows all of this stuff.

204
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In case you can't tell, that's, like,

205
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.

206
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,

207
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal.

208
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.

209
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.

210
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And we, all of us,

211
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
have to understand

212
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that this is about us,

213
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that we can make a difference here.

214
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,

215
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but I'm sure you're rich if you did.

216
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like

217
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a heart, a giraffe, a star?

218
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.

219
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that they could figure it out,

220
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that we could sell this stuff to kids.

221
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids

222
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that chicken looks like chicken?

223
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But this is what most schools serve.

224
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,

225
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve.

226
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We really need to change

227
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
this whole paradigm with kids and food.

228
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We really have to teach children

229
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that chicken is not a giraffe.

230
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
You know, that vegetables

231
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
are actually colorful, that they have flavor,

232
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that carrots grow in the ground,

233
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that strawberries grow in the ground.

234
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.

235
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You know, we have to change

236
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the way we teach kids about these things.

237
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools

238
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools

239
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
actually getting fresh food into schools.

240
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.

241
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We have no high-fructose corn syrup,

242
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
no trans fats, no processed foods.

243
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We're cooking from scratch every day.

244
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We have 25 percent of our --

245
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Applause)

246
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff

247
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is organic and local. We cook.

248
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.

249
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
every day and go cook the food for the kids,

250
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because this is what we need to do.

251
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We can't keep serving kids

252
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
processed crap,

253
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
full of chemicals,

254
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.

255
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You're not going to get the next generation,

256
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or the generation after, to be able to think like this

257
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
if they're not nourished.

258
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
If they're eating

259
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
chemicals all the time,

260
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they're not going to be able to think.

261
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They're not going to be smart.

262
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
You know what? They're just going to be sick.

263
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley

264
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,

265
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
very, very different, and I needed to market it.

266
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.

267
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And these calendars really started to lay out my program.

268
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes

269
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and all the gardening classes in our school district.

270
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So this is a typical menu.

271
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.

272
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And you see these recipes on the side?

273
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.

274
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.

275
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.

276
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If we're going to change children's relationship to food,

277
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,

278
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes --

279
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
and academic curriculum to tie it all together.

280
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,

281
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,

282
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.

283
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow,

284
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.

285
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is available on my website in English and Spanish,

286
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.

287
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.

288
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We have to start changing this.

289
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We have to make kids understand

290
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that their food choices make a big difference.

291
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.

292
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And why this is so important is

293
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that we now have grown a generation,

294
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals

295
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car

296
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.

297
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
What are kids learning? Where is the family time?

298
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Where is socialization? Where is discussion?

299
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Where is learning to talk?

300
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You know, we have to change it.

301
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.

302
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.

303
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We have to teach kids

304
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that Coke and Pop Tarts

305
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
aren't breakfast.

306
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet

307
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
of refined sugar,

308
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.

309
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.

310
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We have recycling in all of our schools.

311
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
You know, the things that we maybe do at home

312
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and think are so important,

313
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
we have to teach kids about in school.

314
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It has to be so much a part of them

315
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that they really get it.

316
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Because, you know what, many of us

317
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
are sort of at the end of our careers,

318
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and we need to be giving these kids --

319
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
these young kids, the next generation --

320
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the tools to save themselves

321
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and save the planet.

322
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.

323
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I work with private companies

324
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
who are willing to do R & D with me,

325
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
who are willing to do distribution for me,

326
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who are really willing to work to go into schools.

327
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Schools are underfunded.

328
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Most schools in America spend less

329
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.

330
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That comes down to under five dollars an hour.

331
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour

332
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
for babysitters when you have them.

333
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.

334
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And if we're going to change it,

335
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and change how we feed kids,

336
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
we really have to rethink that.

337
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So, public and private partnerships,

338
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
advocacy groups, working with foundations.

339
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In our school district, the way we afford this

340
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
is our school district allocates .03 percent

341
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
of the general fund

342
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district

343
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
allocated a half to one percent,

344
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we could start to really fix this program.

345
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We really need to change it.

346
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It's going to take more money.

347
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about

348
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
kids getting exercise.

349
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And one of the simple things we can do

350
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
is put recess before lunch.

351
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It's sort of this "duh" thing.

352
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch

353
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,

354
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.

355
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.

356
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down

357
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.

358
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,

359
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.

360
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We need to --

361
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we need to educate.

362
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We need to educate the kids.

363
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
We need to educate the staff.

364
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I had 90 employees.

365
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.

366
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And, you know, I'm not that better off now.

367
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But we really have to educate.

368
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking

369
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
about ways to teach people how to cook again,

370
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
because, of course, they don't --

371
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
because we've had this processed food in schools

372
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and institutions for so long.

373
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We need 40-minute lunches --

374
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
most schools have 20-minute lunches --

375
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and lunches that are time-appropriate.

376
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
There was just a big study done, and so many schools

377
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.

378
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
That is not lunchtime.

379
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.

380
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And just remember,

381
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
at very least tacitly,

382
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
this is what we're teaching children

383
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
as what they should be doing.

384
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I think if we're going to fix this,

385
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
one of the things we have to do

386
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
is really change how we have oversight

387
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
over the National School Lunch Program.

388
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,

389
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I think it should be under CDC.

390
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
If we started to think about food

391
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and how we feed our kids

392
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
as a health initiative,

393
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and we started thinking about food as health,

394
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs

395
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
as lunch.

396
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Okay, Finance 101 on this,

397
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,

398
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
because I think this is something we all have to understand.

399
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars

400
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
feeding 30 million children a year.

401
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
That number probably needs to double.

402
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"

403
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year

404
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
on fast food.

405
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
We spend 100 billion dollars a year

406
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
on diet aids.

407
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,

408
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
which is why we need all the diet aids.

409
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
We spend 200 billion dollars a year

410
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
on diet-related illness today,

411
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.

412
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
200 billion.

413
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
So you know what, when we talk

414
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.

415
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --

416
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that's what the government allocates for lunch.

417
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.

418
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
That means we spend less than a dollar a day

419
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
on food for kids in schools --

420
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.

421
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.

422
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
Now I don't know about you,

423
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,

424
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.

425
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
One gourmet coffee,

426
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
one, is more --

427
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids

428
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
for an entire week

429
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
in our schools.

430
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
You know what? We should be ashamed.

431
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
We, as a country, should be ashamed

432
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
at that.

433
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
The richest country.

434
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
In our country,

435
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
it's the kids that need it the most,

436
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
who get this really, really lousy food.

437
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
It's the kids who have parents and grandparents

438
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and uncles and aunts that can't even afford

439
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to pay for school lunch that gets this food.

440
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And those are the same kids

441
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
who are going to be getting sick.

442
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.

443
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
We can all make a difference.

444
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
That every single one of us,

445
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
whether we have children,

446
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,

447
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
or anything --

448
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
that we can make a difference.

449
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,

450
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,

451
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
or nieces and nephews shopping

452
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.

453
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Sit down and care.

454
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And on the macro level,

455
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
we're in what seems to be

456
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
a 19-month presidential campaign,

457
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and of all the things we're asking

458
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
all of these potential leaders,

459
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
what about asking for the health of our children?

460
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that's going to tell you a little bit

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about how we open user-generated content up for business.

6
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, here's the first story.

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:47,000
1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
what he called the, quote, "talking machines."

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.

11
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is what he had to say.

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of music in this country.

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,

15
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you would find young people together

16
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.

19
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.

22
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is a picture of culture.

23
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We could describe it using modern computer terminology

24
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as a kind of read-write culture.

25
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's a culture where people participate in the creation

26
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.

27
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:,000
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity

28
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.

29
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,

30
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
what we could call read-only culture.

31
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Culture where creativity was consumed

32
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but the consumer is not a creator.

33
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
A culture which is top-down, owned,

34
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.

35
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,

36
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:34,000
at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --

37
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.

38
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Never before in the history of human culture

39
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.

40
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Never before has creativity of the millions

41
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
been as effectively displaced,

42
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."

43
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The twentieth century was that century

44
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where, at least for those places we know the best,

45
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:05,000
culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.

46
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, second. Land is a kind of property --

47
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it is property. It's protected by law.

48
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,

49
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for most of the history of trespass law,

50
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:26,000
by presuming it protects the land all the way down below

51
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and to an indefinite extent upward.

52
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, that was a pretty good system

53
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
for most of the history of the regulation of land,

54
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:4,000
until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,

55
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
were these instruments trespassers

56
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as they flew over land without clearing the rights

57
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of the farms below as they traveled across the country?

58
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.

59
0:03:55,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,

60
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
had a significant complaint because of these technologies.

61
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The complaint was that their

62
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes

63
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and flew themselves into the walls of the barn

64
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when the airplanes flew over the land.

65
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone

66
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to say these airplanes were trespassing.

67
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Since time immemorial, the law had said,

68
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,

69
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
so this flight must stop.

70
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition

71
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,

72
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that the Causbys must lose.

73
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land

74
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,

75
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
otherwise every transcontinental flight would

76
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
subject the operator to countless trespass suits.

77
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --

78
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter) --

79
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Revolts at the idea. Common sense.

80
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terror

81
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to rain down on the content industry

82
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:

83
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a new way to spread content,

84
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and therefore a new battle over the control

85
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of the businesses that would spread content.

86
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, at that time, the entity,

87
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights

88
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
for most of the music that would be broadcast

89
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
using these technologies was ASCAP.

90
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,

91
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate

92
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
to the broadcasters who really was in charge.

93
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,

94
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
until the broadcasters finally got together

95
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and said, okay, enough of this.

96
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:19,000
called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.

98
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And BMI was much more democratic in the art

99
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that it would include within its repertoire,

100
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.

101
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But most important was that BMI took public domain works

102
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free

103
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to their subscribers. So that in 1940,

104
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,

105
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.

106
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.

107
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music

108
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
was no longer available, because they had shifted

109
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the second best public domain provided by BMI.

110
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.

111
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the important point to recognize

112
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is that even though these broadcasters

113
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
were broadcasting something you would call second best,

114
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that competition was enough to break, at that time,

115
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:29,000
this legal cartel over access to music.

116
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.

117
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In my view, the most significant thing to recognize

118
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
about what this Internet is doing

119
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture

120
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that Sousa romanticized.

121
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Digital technology is the opportunity

122
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
for the revival of these vocal chords

123
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.

124
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:57,000
User-generated content, spreading in businesses

125
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
in extraordinarily valuable ways like these,

126
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
celebrating amateur culture.

127
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
By which I don't mean amateurish culture,

128
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I mean culture where people produce

129
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
for the love of what they're doing and not for the money.

130
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.

131
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
For when you think of what Sousa romanticized

132
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,

133
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the old songs, you should recognize

134
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
what your kids are doing right now.

135
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Taking the songs of the day and the old songs

136
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and remixing them to make them something different.

137
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's how they understand access to this culture.

138
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, let's have some very few examples

139
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to get a sense of what I'm talking about here.

140
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,

141
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
taking anime captured from television

142
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
re-edited to music tracks.

143
0:08:51,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Music)

144
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.

145
0:09:36,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Music)

146
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

147
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And this is the best.

148
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Music)

149
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
My love ...

150
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
There's only you in my life ...

151
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The only thing that's bright ...

152
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
My first love ...

153
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You're every breath that I take ...

154
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You're every step I make ...

155
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And I ....

156
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I want to share all my love with you ...

157
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:28,000
No one else will do ...

158
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And your eyes ...

159
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They tell me how much you care ...

160
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Music)

161
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So, this is remix, right?

162
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

163
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And it's important to emphasize that what this is not

164
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is not what we call, quote, "piracy."

165
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I'm not talking about nor justifying

166
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
people taking other people's content in wholesale

167
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.

168
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I'm talking about people taking and recreating

169
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
using other people's content, using digital technologies

170
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to say things differently.

171
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now, the importance of this

172
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is not the technique that you've seen here.

173
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here

174
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is something that television and film producers

175
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
have been able to do for the last 50 years.

176
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The importance is that that technique has been democratized.

177
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer

178
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
who can take sounds and images from the culture around us

179
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and use it to say things differently.

180
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.

181
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.

182
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are

183
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
as they increasingly understand digital technologies

184
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and their relationship to themselves.

185
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,

186
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the law has not greeted this Sousa revival

187
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:15,000
with very much common sense.

188
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Instead, the architecture of copyright law

189
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and the architecture of digital technologies,

190
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as they interact, have produced the presumption

191
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that these activities are illegal.

192
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,

193
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape

194
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is that every single use of culture produces a copy.

195
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Every single use therefore requires permission;

196
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
without permission, you are a trespasser.

197
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
You're a trespasser with about as much sense

198
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as these people were trespassers.

199
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Common sense here, though, has not yet revolted

200
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in response to this response that the law has offered

201
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to these forms of creativity.

202
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Instead, what we've seen

203
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:05,000
is something much worse than a revolt.

204
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides

205
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in this debate, in response to this conflict

206
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
between the law and the use of these technologies.

207
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced

208
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that will enable them

209
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to automatically take down from sites like YouTube

210
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
any content that has any copyrighted content in it,

211
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
whether or not there's a judgment of fair use

212
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that might be applied to the use of that content.

213
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And on the other side, among our kids,

214
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
there's a growing copyright abolitionism,

215
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
a generation that rejects the very notion

216
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright

217
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass

218
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.

219
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:,000
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,

220
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
a fact we should have learned many, many times over,

221
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.

222
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, the balance that I try to fight for,

223
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I, as any good liberal, try to fight for first

224
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
by looking to the government. Total mistake, right?

225
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Laughter)

226
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them

227
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to do something to make the system make more sense.

228
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It failed partly because the courts are too passive,

229
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
partly because the legislatures are corrupted,

230
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
by which I don't mean that there's bribery

231
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
operating to stop real change,

232
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions

233
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
means that policymakers here will not understand this

234
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
until it's too late to fix it.

235
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.

236
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,

237
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,

238
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
and to realize the economic potential of that,

239
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.

240
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here

241
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:12,000
can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.

242
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,

243
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
so instead what we need is two types of changes.

244
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:22,000
First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,

245
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
choose that their work be made available more freely.

246
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So, for example, they can say their work is available freely

247
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
for non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,

248
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but not freely for any commercial use.

249
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And second, we need the businesses

250
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that are building out this read-write culture

251
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,

252
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:49,000
so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,

253
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
can grow on a neutral platform

254
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
where they both exist simultaneously,

255
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:59,000
so that more-free can compete with less-free,

256
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition

257
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:06,000
can teach one the lessons of the other.

258
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Now, I would talk about one particular such plan

259
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that I know something about,

260
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:14,000
but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,

261
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
so I'm not going to talk about this at all.

262
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.

263
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:28,000
That artist choice is the key for new technology

264
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
having an opportunity to be open for business,

265
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and we need to build artist choice here

266
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:37,000
if these new technologies are to have that opportunity.

267
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:4,000
But let me end with something I think much more important --

268
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:41,000
much more important than business.

269
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:44,000
It's the point about how this connects to our kids.

270
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:5,000
We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?

271
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

272
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We made mixed tapes; they remix music.

273
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:56,000
We watched TV; they make TV.

274
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:59,000
It is technology that has made them different,

275
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and as we see what this technology can do,

276
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:04,000
we need to recognize you can't kill

277
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.

278
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
We can't stop our kids from using it.

279
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:13,000
We can only drive it underground.

280
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:16,000
We can't make our kids passive again.

281
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?

282
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:25,000
We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,

283
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
where in many areas of our life,

284
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
we live life constantly against the law.

285
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Ordinary people live life against the law,

286
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.

287
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
They live life knowing they live it against the law.

288
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:44,000
That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,

289
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
extraordinarily corrupting.

290
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.

291
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.

292
0:18:58,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Thank you very much.

293
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:05,000
(Applause)

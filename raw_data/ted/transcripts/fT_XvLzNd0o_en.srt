1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here today

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to start a revolution.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now before you get up in arms,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or you break into song,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or you pick a favorite color,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want to define what I mean by revolution.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
By revolution,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I mean a drastic and far-reaching change

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the way we think and behave --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the way we think and the way we behave.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We need a revolution

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because things aren't working; they're just not working.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And that makes me really sad

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because I'm sick and tired of things not working.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm sick and tired of us being last.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And we are last place in so many things --

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for example, social factors.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We're last place in Europe in innovation.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We're last place in health care,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and that's important for a sense of well-being.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And worst of all,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We're the saddest place on Earth,

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
relative to GDP per capita --

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the saddest place on Earth.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That's social. Let's look at education.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Where do we rank three weeks ago

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in another report by the OECD?

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Last in reading, math and science. Last.

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Business:

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The lowest perception in the E.U.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Why as a result, what happens?

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And this is despite the fact

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that everybody knows that small business

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is the engine of economies.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So if our engine's broken, guess what?

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Last in Europe GDP per capita.

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Last.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are not optimistic about the future.

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We're unhappy, we have bad education,

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and we have the worst businesses.

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And these are facts, guys.

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's not.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I think it should be really, really clear

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that our system is broken.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The way we think, the way we behave,

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
our operating system of behaving is broken.

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to transform Bulgaria for the better,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for ourselves, for our friends,

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for our family and for our future.

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
How did this happen?

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I think we're last because --

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and this is going to be drastic to some of you --

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because we are handicapping ourselves.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We're holding ourselves back

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because we don't value play.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I said "play," all right.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Babies play, kids play,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
adults play.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We don't value play.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In fact, we devalue play.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And we devalue it in three areas.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Let's go back to the same three areas.

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Social: 45 years of what?

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Of communism --

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
of valuing the society and the state over the individual

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and squashing, inadvertently,

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And instead, what do we value?

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Because it's shown

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the way we apply, generate and use knowledge

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is affected by our social and institutional context,

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which told us what in communism?

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
To be serious.

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
To be really, really serious.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It did.

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Applause)

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Be serious.

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for letting my kids play on the ground.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I have been told by babas and dyados

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that we shouldn't let our kids play so much

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because life is serious

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We have a serious meme running through.

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's a social gene running through us.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's a serious gene.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's 45 years of it

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's created what I call the "baba factor."

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Applause)

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And here's how it works.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But then what happens in step three?

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I want to go back to work

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'm going to give bebko to baba.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But we need to remember

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
So what happens?

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
She passes that virus on to baby,

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees --

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for that serious meme

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to get out of our operating system.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What happens then?

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that has little changed for 100 years,

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that values rote learning,

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
memorization and standardization,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and devalues self-expression, self-exploration,

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
questioning, creativity and play.

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's a crap system.

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We went to this prestigious little school

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and science eight times a week

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and reading five times a day and all this stuff.

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And we said, "He's five."

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
What a crime. What a crime.

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And it's a crime

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that our education system is so serious because education is serious

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that we're creating mindless, robotic workers

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But I'm sorry, the problems of today

146
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We need adaptability,

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We don't need mechanized workers.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to lever and just throw away.

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Autocratic --

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
do what I say because I'm the chef.

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'm the boss and I know better than you.

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

159
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Controlling --

160
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make

161
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.

162
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
don't be on I.M.

165
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.

166
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling

167
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and you're not having any fun.

169
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
In social, in education and in our business,

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
don't value play.

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And that's why we're last,

172
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because we don't value play.

173
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It can't be because of play.

175
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Just play, that's a stupid thing."

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We have the serious meme in us.

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Well I'm going to say no.

178
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --

179
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.

181
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Play:

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
our brains

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are hardwired for play.

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Evolution has selected,

185
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
over millions and billions of years,

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for play in animals and in humans.

187
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And you know what?

188
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Evolution does a really, really good job

189
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and selecting traits for competitive advantage.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Throughout the animal kingdom, for example:

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
ants. Ants play.

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Maybe you didn't know that.

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But when they're playing,

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Rats play, but what you might not have known

198
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is that rats that play more

199
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
have bigger brains

200
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and they learn tasks better,

201
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
skills.

202
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.

203
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But what you may not know

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is that kittens deprived of play

205
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
are unable to interact socially.

206
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.

207
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Bears play.

208
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But what you may not know

209
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that bears that play more survive longer.

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.

211
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's the ones that play more.

212
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And a final really interesting study --

213
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it's been shown, a correlation

214
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
between play and brain size.

215
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.

216
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.

217
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But who do you think

218
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with the biggest brains are the biggest players?

219
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Yours truly: humans.

220
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Kids play, we play --

221
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of every nationality, of every race,

222
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of every color, of every religion.

223
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's a universal thing -- we play.

224
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.

225
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Really cool term: neoteny --

226
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.

227
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And who are the biggest neotenists?

228
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Humans. We play sports.

229
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.

230
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We play musical instruments.

231
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We dance, we kiss, we sing,

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we just goof around.

233
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We're designed by nature to play

234
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
from birth to old age.

235
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We're designed to do that continuously --

236
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to play and play a lot

237
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and not stop playing.

238
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It is a huge benefit.

239
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Just like there's benefits to animals,

240
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there's benefits to humans.

241
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
For example, it's been shown

242
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,

243
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in the area where it controls emotions.

244
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development

245
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
where a lot of cognition is happening.

246
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
As a result, what happens?

247
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.

248
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We develop better decision-making ability

249
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
if we play more.

250
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
These guys are facts.

251
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;

252
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it's cold, hard science.

253
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
These are the benefits to play.

254
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It is a genetic birthright that we have,

255
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
like walking or speaking or seeing.

256
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And if we handicap ourselves with play,

257
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we handicap ourselves

258
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
as if we would with any other birthright that we have.

259
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We hold ourselves back.

260
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Little exercise just for a second:

261
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
close your eyes

262
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and try to imagine a world without play.

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,

264
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
without song, without dancing,

265
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
without soccer, without football,

266
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
without laughter.

267
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What does this world look like?

268
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It's pretty bleak.

269
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's pretty glum.

270
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now imagine your workplace.

271
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

272
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.

273
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

274
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,

275
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?

276
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We have this concept

277
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that the opposite of play is work.

278
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.

279
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"

280
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.

281
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He's going to think I'm not working hard."

282
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.

283
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The opposite of play

284
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is not work.

285
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The opposite of play

286
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is depression. It's depression.

287
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In fact,

288
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
play improves our work.

289
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,

290
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
there's benefits for play at work.

291
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For example, it stimulates creativity.

292
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It increases our openness to change.

293
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It improves our ability to learn.

294
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery --

295
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
two key motivational things

296
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
that increase productivity,

297
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
through play.

298
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious,

299
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
play doesn't mean frivolous.

300
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,

301
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
he's serious about it, but he loves it.

302
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.

303
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
A doctor might be serious,

304
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but laughter's still a great medicine.

305
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Our thinking is backwards.

306
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.

307
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We should be celebrating play.

308
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Quick example from the corporate world.

309
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.

310
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,

311
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.

312
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
What happens? They give better service --

313
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
not worse, but better.

314
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And when customers call for service

315
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,

316
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
how do the customers feel? They feel great.

317
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?

318
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,

319
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which leads to more profit.

320
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
People, service, profit.

321
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Play increases productivity, not decreases.

322
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And you're going to say,

323
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,

324
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but it can't work in Bulgaria.

325
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
No way. We're different."

326
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.

327
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
One, play is universal.

328
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,

329
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.

330
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.

331
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.

332
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Not one customer would refer us.

333
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I asked them all.

334
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We had marginal profit -- I did.

335
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We had marginal profits,

336
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and we had unhappy stakeholders.

337
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Through some basic change,

338
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
change like improving transparency,

339
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
change like promoting self-direction

340
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and collaboration, encouraging collaboration,

341
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
not autocracy,

342
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the things like having a results-focus.

343
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.

344
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I care that your customer and your team is happy

345
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and you're organized with that.

346
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?

347
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Basically promoting fun.

348
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Through promoting fun and a great environment,

349
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
we were able to transform Sciant

350
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and, in just three short years --

351
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
sounds like a long time, but change is slow --

352
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,

353
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
above average profits for the industry

354
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and happy stakeholders.

355
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"

356
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Well we did win, every year that we entered,

357
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
one of the rankings for best employer for small business.

358
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Independent analysis from anonymous employees

359
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
on their surveys.

360
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.

361
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
There's nothing holding us back,

362
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
except our own mentality about play.

363
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up --

364
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
how to make this revolution through play.

365
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
First of all, you have to believe me.

366
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you don't believe me,

367
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
well just go home and think about it some more or something.

368
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,

369
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you need to rediscover play.

370
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,

371
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that you enjoyed only six months ago,

372
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,

373
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
because you feel like you have to be serious,

374
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
rediscover it.

375
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.

376
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Rediscover that

377
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
because you're the leaders,

378
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.

379
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
You're the ones that have to go back to the office

380
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
or talk to your friends

381
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.

382
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,

383
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.

384
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."

385
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.

386
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,

387
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.

388
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.

389
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm going to let you challenge authority.

390
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done

391
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in

392
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and create innovative solutions

393
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to problems of today.

394
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We're not always right as leaders.

395
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We're going to eradicate fear.

396
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Fear is the enemy of play.

397
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And we're going to do things

398
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
like eliminate restrictions.

399
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
You know what, let them use their mobile phone

400
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
for personal calls -- heaven forbid.

401
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Let them be on the Internet.

402
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Let them be on instant messengers.

403
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Let them take long lunches.

404
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Lunch is like the recess for work.

405
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It's when you go out in the world

406
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,

407
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
you have a beer, you have some food, you talk,

408
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
you get some synergy of ideas

409
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that maybe you wouldn't have had before.

410
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Let them do it. Give them some freedom,

411
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.

412
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We spend so much of our lives at the workplace,

413
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,

414
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?

415
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Is that all there was?"

416
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.

417
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Laughter)

418
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
So in summary,

419
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
we need a drastic change

420
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
in the way we think and behave,

421
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
but we don't need

422
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
a workers' revolution.

423
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We don't need a workers' revolution.

424
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
What we need

425
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
is a players' uprising.

426
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
What we need is a players' uprising.

427
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
What we need is a players' uprising.

428
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Seriously, we need to band together.

429
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Today is the start of the uprising.

430
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
But what you need to do

431
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
is fan the flames of the revolution.

432
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories

433
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
of what worked

434
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
about reinvigorating our lives, our schools,

435
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and our work with play;

436
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
about how play promotes

437
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
a sense of promise and self-fulfillment;

438
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
of how play promotes innovation and productivity,

439
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.

440
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together,

441
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play,

442
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
we can transform Bulgaria for the better.

443
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Thank you.

444
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Applause)

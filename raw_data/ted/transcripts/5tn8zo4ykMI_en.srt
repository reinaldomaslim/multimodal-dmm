0:00:13.753,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few weeks ago,

2
0:00:14.944,000 --> 0:00:18,000
somebody tweeted during the midterm elections in the United States

3
0:00:19.683,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that Election Day should be made a holiday.

4
0:00:22.626,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I retweeted, saying,

5
0:00:24.202,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Well, you're welcome to come to my country and vote.

6
0:00:26.822,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You'll get the whole week off to allow the military to count it."

7
0:00:30.742,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I come from Togo, by the way.

8
0:00:32.235,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It is a beautiful country located in West Africa.

9
0:00:35.531,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There are some cool, interesting facts about my country.

10
0:00:39.446,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Togo has been ruled by the same family for 51 years,

11
0:00:42.634,000 --> 0:00:45,000
making us the oldest autocracy in Africa.

12
0:00:46.149,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That's a record.

13
0:00:47.347,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We have a second-coolest record:

14
0:00:48.965,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we have been ranked three times as the unhappiest country on earth.

15
0:00:53.194,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You are all invited.

16
0:00:54.715,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:56.486,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So just to let you know,

18
0:00:57.895,000 --> 0:01:,000
it's not very cool to live under an autocracy.

19
0:01:01.283,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But the interesting thing is that I have met, throughout the course of my activism,

20
0:01:05.303,000 --> 0:01:06,000
so many people from different countries,

21
0:01:07.27,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and when I tell them about Togo, their reaction is always,

22
0:01:10.072,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"How can you guys allow the same people to terrorize you for 51 years?

23
0:01:14.119,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You know, like, you Togolese, you must be very patient."

24
0:01:16.929,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That's their diplomatic way of saying "stupid."

25
0:01:19.604,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:21.262,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And when you live in a free country,

27
0:01:24.477,000 --> 0:01:27,000
there's this tendency of assuming that those who are oppressed

28
0:01:27.9,000 --> 0:01:3,000
tolerate their oppression or are comfortable with it,

29
0:01:31.013,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and democracy is projected as a progressive form of governance

30
0:01:35.581,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in such a way that those people who don't live under democratic countries

31
0:01:39.885,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are seen as people who are not intellectually or maybe morally

32
0:01:44.06,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as advanced as others.

33
0:01:46.14,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But it's not the case.

34
0:01:47.755,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The reason why people have that perception

35
0:01:49.914,000 --> 0:01:53,000
has to do with the way stories are covered about dictatorships.

36
0:01:53.96,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In the course of my activism,

37
0:01:55.376,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I have had to interview with so many news outlets out there,

38
0:01:59.802,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and usually it would always start with, "What got you started?

39
0:02:02.838,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What inspired you?"

40
0:02:04.79,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I reply, "I wasn't inspired. I was triggered."

41
0:02:08.521,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it goes on. "Well, what triggered you?"

42
0:02:11.706,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I go on about how my father was arrested when I was 13, and tortured,

43
0:02:16.403,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all the history ... I don't want to get into details now,

44
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because you'll start sleeping.

45
0:02:20.628,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But the thing is, at the end of the day, what interests them the most is:

46
0:02:24.096,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How was he tortured?

47
0:02:25.29,000 --> 0:02:27,000
For how many days? How many people died?

48
0:02:27.817,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They are interested in the abuse, in the killing,

49
0:02:32.458,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because they believe that will gain attention and sympathy.

50
0:02:36.596,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But in reality, it serves the purpose of the dictator.

51
0:02:39.952,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It helps them advertise their cruelty.

52
0:02:43.489,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In 2011, I cofounded a movement I call "Faure Must Go,"

53
0:02:47.888,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because Faure is the first name of our president.

54
0:02:50.432,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Togo is a French-speaking country, by the way,

55
0:02:52.648,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but I chose English because I had my issues with France as well.

56
0:02:56.121,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But then --

57
0:02:57.425,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:00.041,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But then, when I started Faure Must Go,

59
0:03:03.055,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I made a video, and I came on camera,

60
0:03:05.295,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I said, "Well, Faure Gnassingbé, I give you 60 days to resign as president,

61
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because if you don't,

62
0:03:10.503,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we the youth in Togo will organize and we will bring you down,

63
0:03:13.57,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because you have killed over 500 of our countrymen

64
0:03:16.942,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to seize power when your father died.

65
0:03:18.766,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We have not chosen you.

66
0:03:20.055,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You are an imposter, and we will remove you."

67
0:03:22.532,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But I was the only known face of the movement.

68
0:03:24.807,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Why? Because I was the only stupid one.

69
0:03:27.127,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:29.174,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And the backlashes followed.

71
0:03:31.479,000 --> 0:03:33,000
My family started receiving threats.

72
0:03:33.698,000 --> 0:03:35,000
My siblings called me one morning.

73
0:03:36.198,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They said, "You know what?

74
0:03:37.518,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When they come here to kill you, we don't want to die with you,

75
0:03:40.53,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so move out."

76
0:03:41.723,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So yes, I moved out.

77
0:03:43.647,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I'm so angry at them, so I haven't talked to them in five years.

78
0:03:47.236,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Anyway, moving forward ...

79
0:03:50.133,000 --> 0:03:56,000
For the past nine years, I have been working with countries

80
0:03:56.287,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to raise awareness of Togo,

81
0:03:58.682,000 --> 0:04:,000
to help the people of Togo overcome their fear

82
0:04:00.871,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so they, too, can come and say they want change.

83
0:04:04.476,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I have received a lot of persecution

84
0:04:07.759,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that I cannot disclose,

85
0:04:09.259,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a lot of threats, a lot of abuse,

86
0:04:11.51,000 --> 0:04:12,000
psychologically.

87
0:04:13.02,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But I don't like talking about them,

88
0:04:14.86,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because I know that my job as an activist is to mobilize,

89
0:04:18.815,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is to organize,

90
0:04:20.093,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is to help every single Togolese citizen understand that, as citizens,

91
0:04:25.519,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we hold the power,

92
0:04:26.733,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we are the boss and we decide.

93
0:04:28.506,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And the punishment that the dictators are using to intimidate them

94
0:04:33.318,000 --> 0:04:36,000
must not prevent us from getting what we want.

95
0:04:37.439,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That is why I said it is very important to cover the stories of activists

96
0:04:43.093,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in the way that it helps mobilize people,

97
0:04:45.552,000 --> 0:04:48,000
not in the way that it helps deter their action

98
0:04:48.75,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and force even more their subjugation to the oppressive system.

99
0:04:54.808,000 --> 0:04:56,000
During these years that I've been an activist,

100
0:04:57.003,000 --> 0:05:,000
there are days that I felt like quitting because I couldn't take it.

101
0:05:00.274,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Well then, what kept me going?

102
0:05:01.918,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The one thing that kept me going:

103
0:05:03.976,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I remember the story of my grandfather,

104
0:05:05.872,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and how he used to walk 465 miles from his village to the city,

105
0:05:11.463,000 --> 0:05:13,000
just to protest for independence.

106
0:05:13.505,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Then I remember the sacrifice of my father,

107
0:05:15.837,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who was tortured so many times

108
0:05:17.996,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for daring to protest against the regime.

109
0:05:21.716,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Back in the '70s, they would write pamphlets

110
0:05:24.271,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to raise awareness on the dictatorship,

111
0:05:27.092,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and because they couldn't afford to make copies,

112
0:05:29.672,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they would reproduce the same pamphlet 500 times each

113
0:05:33.448,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and distribute them.

114
0:05:34.942,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It got to a point where the military knew their handwriting,

115
0:05:37.859,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so as soon as they stumbled upon one, they'd go and get them.

116
0:05:40.819,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But I look at that and I'm like, you know, today you have a blog.

117
0:05:44.982,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I don't have to copy the same thing 500 times.

118
0:05:48.059,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I blog and thousands of people read it.

119
0:05:50.752,000 --> 0:05:52,000
By the way, in Togo, they like calling me the WhatsApp girl,

120
0:05:53.688,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because I am always on WhatsApp attacking the government.

121
0:05:56.463,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:57.637,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So it's much easier.

123
0:05:58.837,000 --> 0:06:01,000
When I'm angry at the government, I just make an angry note,

124
0:06:02.052,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I send it out and thousands of people share it.

125
0:06:05.084,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I'm rarely this composed. I'm always angry, by the way.

126
0:06:08.607,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:11.677,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

128
0:06:20.247,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So I was talking about the necessity to showcase our stories,

129
0:06:24.81,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because when I think about the sacrifices that were made for us,

130
0:06:28.008,000 --> 0:06:29,000
it helped me keep going.

131
0:06:29.679,000 --> 0:06:31,000
One of the very first actions of our Faure Must Go movement

132
0:06:32.524,000 --> 0:06:35,000
was to come up with a petition, asking citizens to sign

133
0:06:35.935,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that we can demand new elections, as the constitution allows.

134
0:06:40.065,000 --> 0:06:41,000
People were scared to put their names

135
0:06:41.909,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because, they said, they don't want to get in trouble.

136
0:06:44.519,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Even in the diaspora, people were scared.

137
0:06:46.549,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They were like, "We have family at home."

138
0:06:48.565,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But there was this woman who was in her 60s.

139
0:06:50.979,000 --> 0:06:53,000
When she heard about it, she took the petition,

140
0:06:54.661,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and she went home,

141
0:06:56.55,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and by herself she collected over 1,000 [signatures].

142
0:07:00.164,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That inspired me so much, and I was like,

143
0:07:02.762,000 --> 0:07:06,000
if a 60-year-old that has nothing more to gain in this regime

144
0:07:07.249,000 --> 0:07:08,000
can do this for us, the young ones,

145
0:07:09.094,000 --> 0:07:1,000
then why should I quit?

146
0:07:10.686,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It is the stories of resistance, the stories of defiance,

147
0:07:14.734,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the stories of resilience,

148
0:07:16.819,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that inspire people to get involved,

149
0:07:18.943,000 --> 0:07:21,000
not the stories of abuse and killings and hurt,

150
0:07:22.456,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because as humans, it's only natural for us to be scared.

151
0:07:26.268,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I would like to share with you a few characteristics of dictatorships

152
0:07:29.827,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so that you can assess your own country

153
0:07:32.485,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and see if you are also at risk of joining us.

154
0:07:35.561,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter and cheers)

155
0:07:37.923,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Applause)

156
0:07:43.141,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Number one thing to look at: concentration of power.

157
0:07:45.691,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Is the power in your country concentrated in the hands of a few, an elite?

158
0:07:49.192,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It can be a political elite, ideological elite.

159
0:07:51.848,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And you have a strongman,

160
0:07:53.434,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because we always have one guy who is presented as the messiah

161
0:07:57.051,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who will save us from the world.

162
0:07:59.037,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The second point is propaganda.

163
0:08:01.538,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Dictators feed on propaganda.

164
0:08:03.675,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They like giving the impression that they are the saviors,

165
0:08:06.443,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and without them, the country will fall apart.

166
0:08:08.646,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And they are always fighting some foreign forces, you know?

167
0:08:11.825,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The Christians, the Jewish, the Muslims,

168
0:08:13.976,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the voodoo priests are coming for you.

169
0:08:16.233,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The Communists, when they get here, we'll all be broke.

170
0:08:18.884,000 --> 0:08:19,000
These kinds of things.

171
0:08:20.093,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And our president, in particular, he fights pirates.

172
0:08:23.732,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:24.935,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I am very serious.

174
0:08:26.132,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Last year, he bought a boat that's 13 million dollars to fight pirates,

175
0:08:29.969,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and 60 percent of our people are starving.

176
0:08:32.413,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So they are always protecting us from some foreign forces.

177
0:08:35.198,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And this leads to point three: militarization.

178
0:08:37.989,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Dictators survive by instigating fear,

179
0:08:40.953,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and they use the military to suppress dissident voices,

180
0:08:43.857,000 --> 0:08:45,000
even though they try to give the impression

181
0:08:45.915,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that the military is to protect the nation.

182
0:08:47.97,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And they suppress institutions and destroy them

183
0:08:50.398,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so that they don't have to be held accountable.

184
0:08:53.092,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So do you have a heavily militarized country?

185
0:08:55.891,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And this leads to point four, what I call human cruelty.

186
0:08:59.448,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You know when we talk about animals,

187
0:09:01.503,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we say animal cruelty when animals are abused,

188
0:09:04.168,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because there's no charter acknowledged by the UN

189
0:09:07.174,000 --> 0:09:09,000
saying animal rights charter.

190
0:09:09.989,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Point one: all animals are created equal. So you don't have that.

191
0:09:13.337,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So whenever animals are abused, we say animal cruelty.

192
0:09:16.47,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But when it comes to humans, we say human rights abuses,

193
0:09:19.915,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because we assume that all humans have rights.

194
0:09:22.405,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But some of us are actually still fighting for our right to have rights.

195
0:09:26.046,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So in that condition, I don't talk about human rights abuse or violation.

196
0:09:30.344,000 --> 0:09:33,000
When you live in a country and you have an issue with the president

197
0:09:33.592,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the worst thing that can happen is he bans you from the presidency,

198
0:09:37.03,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you are lucky.

199
0:09:38.205,000 --> 0:09:41,000
When you come to my country and have an issue with the president,

200
0:09:41.3,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you just run, disappear; you vanish from the universe,

201
0:09:43.862,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because they can still find you in Turkey.

202
0:09:45.934,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So people like myself, we don't get to live in Togo anymore.

203
0:09:48.813,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And people like myself,

204
0:09:49.993,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we don't get to live in the same place for more than a month,

205
0:09:52.923,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because we don't want to be traced.

206
0:09:54.632,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The way they abuse people,

207
0:09:55.934,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the type of cruelty that happens in all impunity under dictatorships

208
0:09:59.854,000 --> 0:10:01,000
are beyond human imagination.

209
0:10:02.476,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The stories of some of the activists that were killed,

210
0:10:05.127,000 --> 0:10:07,000
their bodies dumped in the sea,

211
0:10:07.576,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that were tortured

212
0:10:09.038,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to the point where they lost their hearing or their sight --

213
0:10:12.337,000 --> 0:10:13,000
those stories still haunt me.

214
0:10:13.909,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And sometimes, as an activist,

215
0:10:15.937,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I am less concerned about dying than how it will happen.

216
0:10:19.029,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Sometimes I just sit down and I imagine all scenarios.

217
0:10:21.711,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What are they going to do? Are they going to cut my ears first?

218
0:10:24.733,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Or are they going to cut my tongue because I'm always insulting them?

219
0:10:28.139,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It sounds cruel, but it is the reality.

220
0:10:30.194,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We live in a very cruel world.

221
0:10:32.642,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Dictators are cruel monsters,

222
0:10:35.373,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I am not saying it to be nice.

223
0:10:39.081,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So yes, that is the final characteristic.

224
0:10:42.501,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The list goes on,

225
0:10:43.83,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but that's the final thing that I want to share about autocracies,

226
0:10:47.026,000 --> 0:10:5,000
so that you look at your country and see if there are risks there.

227
0:10:50.184,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It is important that you acknowledge the gains of freedom that you have today,

228
0:10:54.124,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because some people had to give their lives for you to have it.

229
0:10:57.144,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So don't take this for granted.

230
0:10:59.029,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But then at the same time, you also need to know

231
0:11:01.868,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that no country is actually destined to be oppressed,

232
0:11:05.779,000 --> 0:11:06,000
while at the same time,

233
0:11:07.181,000 --> 0:11:11,000
no country or no people are immune to oppression and dictatorship.

234
0:11:11.825,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Thank you.

235
0:11:13.062,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

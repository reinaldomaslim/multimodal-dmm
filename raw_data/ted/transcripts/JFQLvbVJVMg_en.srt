1
0:00:12.724,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Women represent

2
0:00:14.523,000 --> 0:00:17,000
50 percent of middle management

3
0:00:17.574,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and professional positions,

4
0:00:20.363,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but the percentages of women at the top of organizations

5
0:00:23.491,000 --> 0:00:25,000
represent not even a third of that number.

6
0:00:26.315,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So some people hear that statistic and they ask,

7
0:00:29.82,000 --> 0:00:32,000
why do we have so few women leaders?

8
0:00:33.323,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But I look at that statistic

9
0:00:35.246,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and, if you, like me, believe

10
0:00:38.02,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that leadership manifests at every level,

11
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
you would see that there's a tremendous,

12
0:00:44.786,000 --> 0:00:46,000
awesome resource of leaders

13
0:00:47.767,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who are leading in middle management,

14
0:00:50.523,000 --> 0:00:53,000
which raises a different question:

15
0:00:53.639,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Why are there so many women

16
0:00:55.889,000 --> 0:00:56,000
mired in the middle

17
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and what has to happen

18
0:00:59.702,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to take them to the top?

19
0:01:02.245,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So some of you might be some of those women

20
0:01:04.764,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who are in middle management

21
0:01:06.587,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and seeking to move up in your organization.

22
0:01:10.513,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Well, Tonya is a great example of one of these women.

23
0:01:14.135,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I met her two years ago.

24
0:01:15.834,000 --> 0:01:18,000
She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,

25
0:01:19.17,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,

26
0:01:23.393,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"I've worked really hard to improve my confidence

27
0:01:26.791,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and my assertiveness and develop a great brand,

28
0:01:30.154,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I get terrific performance evals from my boss,

29
0:01:33.979,000 --> 0:01:36,000
my 360s in the organization let me know

30
0:01:37.218,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that my teams love working for me,

31
0:01:40.515,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I've taken every management course that I can here,

32
0:01:44.351,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I am working with a terrific mentor,

33
0:01:46.916,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and yet I've been passed over

34
0:01:49.334,000 --> 0:01:52,000
twice for advancement opportunities,

35
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:54,000
even when my manager knows

36
0:01:54.79,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that I'm committed to moving up

37
0:01:56.601,000 --> 0:02:,000
and even interested in an international assignment.

38
0:02:01.236,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I don't understand why

39
0:02:03.148,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'm being passed over."

40
0:02:05.117,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So what Tonya doesn't realize

41
0:02:07.345,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is that there's a missing 33 percent

42
0:02:10.369,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of the career success equation for women,

43
0:02:13.99,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is

44
0:02:17.815,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that's required to close the gender gap at the top.

45
0:02:22.529,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In order to move up in organizations,

46
0:02:25.543,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you have to be known for your leadership skills,

47
0:02:28.162,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and this would apply to any of you,

48
0:02:29.741,000 --> 0:02:31,000
women or men.

49
0:02:32.29,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It means that you have to be recognized

50
0:02:35.294,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for using the greatness in you

51
0:02:37.971,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes

52
0:02:41.222,000 --> 0:02:44,000
by engaging the greatness in others.

53
0:02:44.901,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Put in other language,

54
0:02:46.291,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it means you have to use your skills

55
0:02:48.309,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and talents and abilities

56
0:02:50.705,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to help the organization achieve

57
0:02:53.113,000 --> 0:02:56,000
its strategic financial goals

58
0:02:56.262,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and do that by working effectively with others

59
0:02:59.907,000 --> 0:03:02,000
inside of the organization and outside.

60
0:03:03.901,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And although all three of these elements

61
0:03:06.196,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of leadership are important,

62
0:03:08.232,000 --> 0:03:1,000
when it comes to moving up in organizations,

63
0:03:10.931,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they aren't equally important.

64
0:03:12.788,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So pay attention to the green box

65
0:03:15.533,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as I move forward.

66
0:03:19.548,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In seeking and identifying

67
0:03:22.34,000 --> 0:03:24,000
employees with high potential,

68
0:03:24.357,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the potential to go to the top of organizations,

69
0:03:29.006,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the skills and competencies

70
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that relate to that green box

71
0:03:34.38,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are rated twice as heavily

72
0:03:36.753,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as those in the other two elements of leadership.

73
0:03:40.567,000 --> 0:03:42,000
These skills and competencies

74
0:03:42.637,000 --> 0:03:44,000
can be summarized as business,

75
0:03:45.337,000 --> 0:03:48,000
strategic, and financial acumen.

76
0:03:48.509,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In other words, this skill set has to do

77
0:03:51.17,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with understanding where the organization is going,

78
0:03:55.483,000 --> 0:03:57,000
what its strategy is,

79
0:03:57.621,000 --> 0:03:59,000
what financial targets it has in place,

80
0:04:00.14,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and understanding your role

81
0:04:01.57,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in moving the organization forward.

82
0:04:04.247,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is that missing 33 percent

83
0:04:08.445,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of the career success equation for women,

84
0:04:11.425,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not because it's missing in our capabilities

85
0:04:13.978,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or abilities,

86
0:04:15.598,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but because it's missing in the advice

87
0:04:17.724,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that we're given.

88
0:04:19.378,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Here's what I mean by that.

89
0:04:21.147,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Five years ago, I was asked to moderate

90
0:04:23.338,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a panel of executives,

91
0:04:25.171,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the topic for the evening was

92
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"What do you look for in high-potential employees?"

93
0:04:30.538,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So think about the three elements of leadership

94
0:04:33.62,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as I summarize for you what they told me.

95
0:04:36.41,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They said, "We look for people

96
0:04:38.907,000 --> 0:04:41,000
who are smart and hard working and committed

97
0:04:42.563,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and trustworthy and resilient."

98
0:04:46.669,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So which element of leadership does that relate to?

99
0:04:50.503,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Personal greatness.

100
0:04:52.519,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They said, "We look for employees

101
0:04:55.2,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who are great with our customers,

102
0:04:57.529,000 --> 0:04:59,000
who empower their teams,

103
0:04:59.723,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who negotiate effectively,

104
0:05:01.781,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who are able to manage conflict well,

105
0:05:04.324,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and are overall great communicators."

106
0:05:07.564,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Which element of leadership does that equate to?

107
0:05:10.874,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Engaging the greatness in others.

108
0:05:13.683,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And then they pretty much stopped.

109
0:05:15.889,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So I asked,

110
0:05:17.12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Well, what about people

111
0:05:19.17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
who understand your business,

112
0:05:21.534,000 --> 0:05:22,000
where it's going,

113
0:05:22.94,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and their role in taking it there?

114
0:05:25.55,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And what about people who are able

115
0:05:26.866,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to scan the external environment,

116
0:05:29.375,000 --> 0:05:31,000
identify risks and opportunities,

117
0:05:32.176,000 --> 0:05:36,000
make strategy or make strategic recommendations?

118
0:05:36.595,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And what about people who are able

119
0:05:38.98,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to look at the financials of your business,

120
0:05:41.558,000 --> 0:05:44,000
understand the story that the financials tell,

121
0:05:45.202,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and either take appropriate action

122
0:05:47.47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or make appropriate recommendations?"

123
0:05:50.209,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And to a man, they said,

124
0:05:52.155,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"That's a given."

125
0:05:54.347,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So I turned to the audience

126
0:05:55.945,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of 150 women and I asked,

127
0:05:58.976,000 --> 0:06:,000
"How many of you have ever been told

128
0:06:01.878,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that the door-opener for career advancement

129
0:06:04.837,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is your business, strategic and financial acumen,

130
0:06:08.616,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and that all the other important stuff

131
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is what differentiates you in the talent pool?"

132
0:06:14.837,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Three women raised their hand,

133
0:06:17.965,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I've asked this question of women

134
0:06:20.1,000 --> 0:06:22,000
all around the globe in the five years since,

135
0:06:22.644,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and the percentage is never much different.

136
0:06:27.358,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So this is obvious, right?

137
0:06:29.495,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But how can it be?

138
0:06:31.407,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Well, there are primarily three reasons

139
0:06:33.443,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that there's this missing 33 percent

140
0:06:35.466,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the career success advice given to women?

141
0:06:39.101,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When organizations direct women

142
0:06:41.63,000 --> 0:06:42,000
toward resources

143
0:06:43.497,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that focus on the conventional advice

144
0:06:45.83,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that we've been hearing for over 40 years,

145
0:06:47.798,000 --> 0:06:51,000
there's a notable absence of advice that relates

146
0:06:51.804,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to business, strategic and financial acumen.

147
0:06:54.952,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Much of the advice is emphasizing

148
0:06:57.787,000 --> 0:06:58,000
personal actions that we need to take,

149
0:06:59.621,000 --> 0:07:01,000
like become more assertive, become more confident,

150
0:07:02.321,000 --> 0:07:03,000
develop your personal brand,

151
0:07:04.03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
things that Tonya's been working on,

152
0:07:06.854,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and advice about working with other people,

153
0:07:09.381,000 --> 0:07:11,000
things like learn to self-promote,

154
0:07:12.2,000 --> 0:07:14,000
get a mentor, enhance your network,

155
0:07:14.365,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and virtually nothing said

156
0:07:16.997,000 --> 0:07:18,000
about the importance of business, strategic

157
0:07:19.07,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and financial acumen.

158
0:07:21.294,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.

159
0:07:25.397,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What it means is that this is advice

160
0:07:28.111,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that's absolutely essential for breaking through

161
0:07:31.115,000 --> 0:07:35,000
from career start to middle management,

162
0:07:35.513,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but it's not the advice

163
0:07:37.257,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that gets women to break through

164
0:07:39.507,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from the middle, where we're 50 percent,

165
0:07:41.824,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to senior and executive positions.

166
0:07:44.377,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And this is why conventional advice to women

167
0:07:47.437,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top

168
0:07:51.532,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and won't close it.

169
0:07:54.434,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, the second reason

170
0:07:56.279,000 --> 0:07:57,000
relates to Tonya's comments

171
0:07:57.967,000 --> 0:08:01,000
about having had excellent performance evals,

172
0:08:02.418,000 --> 0:08:04,000
great feedback from her teams,

173
0:08:05.069,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and having taken every management training program

174
0:08:07.686,000 --> 0:08:09,000
she can lay her hands on.

175
0:08:09.756,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So you would think that she's getting

176
0:08:12.708,000 --> 0:08:14,000
messages from her organization

177
0:08:15.064,000 --> 0:08:17,000
through the talent development systems

178
0:08:17.271,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and performance management systems

179
0:08:19.745,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that let her know how important it is

180
0:08:21.68,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to develop business, strategic and financial acumen,

181
0:08:25.141,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but here again, that green square is quite small.

182
0:08:29.746,000 --> 0:08:3,000
On average,

183
0:08:31.523,000 --> 0:08:33,000
talent and performance management systems

184
0:08:33.829,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the organizations that I've worked with

185
0:08:36.383,000 --> 0:08:38,000
focus three to one

186
0:08:38.858,000 --> 0:08:4,000
on the other two elements of leadership

187
0:08:41.186,000 --> 0:08:43,000
compared to the importance of business,

188
0:08:43.672,000 --> 0:08:45,000
strategic and financial acumen,

189
0:08:46.203,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which is why typical talent and performance systems

190
0:08:50.748,000 --> 0:08:51,000
haven't closed and won't close

191
0:08:52.711,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the gender gap at the top.

192
0:08:55.968,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,

193
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and this is really important to talk about,

194
0:09:02.279,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because if organizations,

195
0:09:03.9,000 --> 0:09:04,000
talent and performance systems

196
0:09:05.754,000 --> 0:09:06,000
aren't giving people in general

197
0:09:07.571,000 --> 0:09:09,000
information about the importance of

198
0:09:10.187,000 --> 0:09:12,000
business, strategic and financial acumen,

199
0:09:12.527,000 --> 0:09:14,000
how are men getting to the top?

200
0:09:14.744,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Well, there are primarily two ways.

201
0:09:17.263,000 --> 0:09:18,000
One is because of the positions

202
0:09:19.13,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they're guided into,

203
0:09:21.222,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and the other is because of informal mentoring

204
0:09:24.193,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and sponsorship.

205
0:09:25.947,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So what's women's experience

206
0:09:27.702,000 --> 0:09:29,000
as it relates to mentoring?

207
0:09:29.907,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Well, this comment from an executive

208
0:09:32.809,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that I worked with recently

209
0:09:34.586,000 --> 0:09:36,000
illustrates that experience.

210
0:09:36.611,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He was very proud of the fact that last year,

211
0:09:39.266,000 --> 0:09:42,000
he had two protégés: a man and a woman.

212
0:09:43.25,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,

213
0:09:46.927,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I helped the man learn the business,

214
0:09:49.346,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and I didn't realize that I was treating them

215
0:09:51.753,000 --> 0:09:52,000
any differently."

216
0:09:53.227,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And he was sincere about that.

217
0:09:55.645,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what this illustrates is that

218
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
as managers, whether we're women or men,

219
0:10:00.23,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we have mindsets about women and men,

220
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
about careers in leadership,

221
0:10:04.127,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and these unexamined mindsets

222
0:10:07.15,000 --> 0:10:1,000
won't close the gender gap at the top.

223
0:10:10.922,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So how do we take this idea

224
0:10:12.67,000 --> 0:10:14,000
of the missing 33 percent

225
0:10:14.713,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and turn it into action?

226
0:10:16.884,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Well, for women, the answer is obvious:

227
0:10:20.281,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we have to begin to focus more

228
0:10:22.554,000 --> 0:10:23,000
on developing and demonstrating

229
0:10:24.491,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the skills we have

230
0:10:26.19,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that show that we're people who understand

231
0:10:28.639,000 --> 0:10:3,000
our businesses, where they're headed,

232
0:10:30.912,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and our role in taking it there.

233
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's what enables that breakthrough

234
0:10:35.726,000 --> 0:10:37,000
from middle management

235
0:10:37.999,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to leadership at the top.

236
0:10:40.867,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.

237
0:10:43.23,000 --> 0:10:46,000
One young scientist that works in a biotech firm

238
0:10:46.931,000 --> 0:10:5,000
used her insight about the missing 33 percent

239
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to weave financial impact data

240
0:10:54.412,000 --> 0:10:55,000
into a project update she did

241
0:10:56.402,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and got tremendous positive feedback

242
0:10:58.742,000 --> 0:11:,000
from the managers in the room.

243
0:11:01.364,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So we don't want to put 100 percent

244
0:11:03.614,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of the responsibility on women's shoulders,

245
0:11:07.123,000 --> 0:11:11,000
nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:

246
0:11:11.443,000 --> 0:11:12,000
In order for companies to achieve

247
0:11:13.209,000 --> 0:11:15,000
their strategic financial goals,

248
0:11:15.886,000 --> 0:11:16,000
executives understand that they have to have

249
0:11:17.844,000 --> 0:11:19,000
everyone pulling in the same direction.

250
0:11:20.6,000 --> 0:11:22,000
In other words, the term we use in business is,

251
0:11:23.142,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we have to have strategic alignment.

252
0:11:25.801,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And executives know this very well,

253
0:11:28.952,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and yet only 37 percent,

254
0:11:31.281,000 --> 0:11:33,000
according to a recent Conference Board report,

255
0:11:33.901,000 --> 0:11:34,000
believe that they have that

256
0:11:35.499,000 --> 0:11:37,000
strategic alignment in place.

257
0:11:38.222,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So for 63 percent of organizations,

258
0:11:41.9,000 --> 0:11:43,000
achieving their strategic financial goals

259
0:11:44.217,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is questionable.

260
0:11:45.973,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And if you think about what I've just shared,

261
0:11:49.156,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that you have situations where at least 50 percent

262
0:11:52.126,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of your middle managers

263
0:11:53.847,000 --> 0:11:55,000
haven't received clear messaging

264
0:11:56.446,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that they have to become focused on the business,

265
0:12:00.23,000 --> 0:12:02,000
where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,

266
0:12:02.768,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it's not surprising that that percentage

267
0:12:04.86,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of executives who are confident about alignment

268
0:12:07.24,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is so low,

269
0:12:08.937,000 --> 0:12:1,000
which is why there are other people

270
0:12:11.906,000 --> 0:12:13,000
who have a role to play in this.

271
0:12:14.292,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's important for directors on boards

272
0:12:17.757,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to expect from their executives

273
0:12:20.749,000 --> 0:12:22,000
proportional pools of women when they sit down

274
0:12:23.268,000 --> 0:12:25,000
once a year for their succession discussions.

275
0:12:25.856,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,

276
0:12:28.961,000 --> 0:12:29,000
it could be a red flag

277
0:12:30.749,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that their organization isn't as aligned

278
0:12:33.641,000 --> 0:12:35,000
as it could potentially be.

279
0:12:36.149,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's important for CEOs

280
0:12:37.645,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to also expect these proportional pools,

281
0:12:40.469,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and if they hear comments like,

282
0:12:41.976,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"Well, she doesn't have enough business experience,"

283
0:12:44.519,000 --> 0:12:45,000
ask the question,

284
0:12:46.05,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"What are we going to do about that?"

285
0:12:48.174,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It's important for H.R. executives

286
0:12:50.323,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to make sure that the missing 33 percent

287
0:12:52.955,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is appropriately emphasized,

288
0:12:55.116,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and it's important for women and men

289
0:12:57.219,000 --> 0:12:59,000
who are in management positions

290
0:12:59.277,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to examine the mindsets we hold

291
0:13:01.42,000 --> 0:13:03,000
about women and men, about careers and success,

292
0:13:03.687,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to make sure we are creating a level playing field

293
0:13:06.398,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for everybody.

294
0:13:08.322,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So let me close with the latest chapter

295
0:13:10.245,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in Tonya's story.

296
0:13:12.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Tonya emailed me two months ago,

297
0:13:13.924,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position,

298
0:13:16.838,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and during the interview, they probed

299
0:13:18.649,000 --> 0:13:19,000
about her business acumen

300
0:13:20.178,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and her strategic insights into the industry,

301
0:13:23.407,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and she said that she was so happy to report

302
0:13:25.871,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that now she has a new position

303
0:13:27.829,000 --> 0:13:3,000
reporting directly to the chief information officer

304
0:13:30.922,000 --> 0:13:32,000
at her company.

305
0:13:33.138,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So for some of you, the missing 33 percent

306
0:13:35.714,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is an idea for you to put into action,

307
0:13:38.695,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and I hope that for all of you,

308
0:13:40.956,000 --> 0:13:43,000
you will see it as an idea worth spreading

309
0:13:44.108,000 --> 0:13:46,000
in order to help organizations be more effective,

310
0:13:46.581,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to help women create careers that soar,

311
0:13:49.157,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and to help close the gender gap at the top.

312
0:13:52.761,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you.

313
0:13:54.584,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.796,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999.

2
0:00:15.964,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was a senior in college,

3
0:00:18.078,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and it was right after a dance practice.

4
0:00:20.034,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was really, really happy.

5
0:00:22.148,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.

6
0:00:26.058,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was sitting in the back of my used minivan

7
0:00:29.301,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in a campus parking lot,

8
0:00:31.088,000 --> 0:00:32,000
when I decided

9
0:00:32.263,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was going to commit suicide.

10
0:00:35.796,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly.

11
0:00:40.388,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I came this close to the edge of the precipice.

12
0:00:43.407,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's the closest I've ever come.

13
0:00:45.529,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger

14
0:00:48.505,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.

15
0:00:51.499,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And after the fact,

16
0:00:53.214,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that's what scared me the most: the element of chance.

17
0:00:57.062,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I became very methodical about testing different ways

18
0:01:00.278,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that I could manage my ups and downs,

19
0:01:02.432,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which has proven to be a good investment. (Laughs)

20
0:01:06.301,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Many normal people might have, say, six to 10 major depressive episodes

21
0:01:10.501,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in their lives.

22
0:01:12.052,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I have bipolar depression. It runs in my family.

23
0:01:14.402,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I've had 50-plus at this point,

24
0:01:17.451,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I've learned a lot.

25
0:01:19.715,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've had a lot of at-bats,

26
0:01:21.592,000 --> 0:01:23,000
many rounds in the ring with darkness,

27
0:01:23.957,000 --> 0:01:24,000
taking good notes.

28
0:01:25.781,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success

29
0:01:29.14,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or highlight reel,

30
0:01:30.317,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I would share my recipe for avoiding self-destruction,

31
0:01:35.061,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and certainly self-paralysis.

32
0:01:38.249,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And the tool I've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net

33
0:01:42.059,000 --> 0:01:43,000
for emotional free fall

34
0:01:44.503,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is actually the same tool

35
0:01:46.096,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that has helped me to make my best business decisions.

36
0:01:48.721,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But that is secondary.

37
0:01:50.553,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And it is ... stoicism.

38
0:01:53.694,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That sounds boring.

39
0:01:55.242,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:56.329,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You might think of Spock,

41
0:01:57.969,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or it might conjure and image like this --

42
0:02:00.508,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:02.008,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a cow standing in the rain.

44
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.

45
0:02:07.354,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way.

46
0:02:11.673,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You might not think of the ultimate competitor, say, Bill Belichick,

47
0:02:16.139,000 --> 0:02:18,000
head coach of the New England Patriots,

48
0:02:18.419,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who has the all-time NFL record for Super Bowl titles.

49
0:02:21.492,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks

50
0:02:26.871,000 --> 0:02:29,000
as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years.

51
0:02:30.679,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You might not think of the Founding Fathers --

52
0:02:34.285,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington

53
0:02:37.447,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to name but three students of stoicism.

54
0:02:40.263,000 --> 0:02:44,000
George Washington actually had a play about a Stoic --

55
0:02:44.385,000 --> 0:02:45,000
this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --

56
0:02:46.392,000 --> 0:02:49,000
performed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated.

57
0:02:50.166,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy?

58
0:02:54.27,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This seems very academic.

59
0:02:56.615,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently,

60
0:03:00.052,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as an operating system for thriving in high-stress environments,

61
0:03:03.339,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for making better decisions.

62
0:03:05.459,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And it all started here,

63
0:03:07.993,000 --> 0:03:08,000
kind of,

64
0:03:09.18,000 --> 0:03:1,000
on a porch.

65
0:03:10.65,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So around 300 BC in Athens,

66
0:03:13.931,000 --> 0:03:15,000
someone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures

67
0:03:16.828,000 --> 0:03:18,000
walking around a painted porch, a "stoa."

68
0:03:19.604,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That later became "stoicism."

69
0:03:22.221,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And in the Greco-Roman world,

70
0:03:24.641,000 --> 0:03:26,000
people used stoicism as a comprehensive system

71
0:03:27.427,000 --> 0:03:28,000
for doing many, many things.

72
0:03:29.36,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself

73
0:03:33.573,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to separate what you can control from what you cannot control,

74
0:03:37.044,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and then doing exercises to focus exclusively

75
0:03:40.126,000 --> 0:03:41,000
on the former.

76
0:03:41.301,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This decreases emotional reactivity,

77
0:03:43.703,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which can be a superpower.

78
0:03:45.983,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Conversely, let's say you're a quarterback.

79
0:03:48.868,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You miss a pass. You get furious with yourself.

80
0:03:51.084,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That could cost you a game.

81
0:03:53.098,000 --> 0:03:56,000
If you're a CEO, and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee

82
0:03:57.032,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because of a minor infraction,

83
0:03:58.556,000 --> 0:04:,000
that could cost you the employee.

84
0:04:01.401,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If you're a college student who, say, is in a downward spiral,

85
0:04:06.758,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and you feel helpless and hopeless,

86
0:04:08.937,000 --> 0:04:09,000
unabated, that could cost you your life.

87
0:04:10.938,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So the stakes are very, very high.

88
0:04:14.078,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there.

89
0:04:17.239,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004.

90
0:04:21.808,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It found me then because of two things:

91
0:04:24.463,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a very close friend, young guy, my age, died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,

92
0:04:29.852,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then my girlfriend, who I thought I was going to marry, walked out.

93
0:04:33.704,000 --> 0:04:37,000
She'd had enough, and she didn't give me a Dear John letter,

94
0:04:37.773,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but she did give me this,

95
0:04:40.148,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a Dear John plaque.

96
0:04:41.484,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:42.556,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'm not making this up. I've kept it.

98
0:04:44.365,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Business hours are over at five o'clock."

99
0:04:47.026,000 --> 0:04:49,000
She gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health,

100
0:04:49.816,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because at the time, I was working on my first real business.

101
0:04:53.109,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I had no idea what I was doing. I was working 14-plus hour days,

102
0:04:56.252,000 --> 0:04:57,000
seven days a week.

103
0:04:58.118,000 --> 0:05:,000
I was using stimulants to get going.

104
0:05:00.436,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep.

105
0:05:03.041,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It was a disaster.

106
0:05:04.256,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I felt completely trapped.

107
0:05:06.465,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers.

108
0:05:10.556,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life,

109
0:05:14.409,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which was, "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality,"

110
0:05:19.58,000 --> 0:05:2,000
by Seneca the Younger,

111
0:05:21.388,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who was a famous Stoic writer.

112
0:05:23.035,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That took me to his letters,

113
0:05:24.875,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which took me to the exercise,

114
0:05:27.352,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"premeditatio malorum,"

115
0:05:29.879,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which means the pre-meditation of evils.

116
0:05:32.199,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In simple terms,

117
0:05:33.379,000 --> 0:05:38,000
this is visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear,

118
0:05:38.522,000 --> 0:05:39,000
preventing you from taking action,

119
0:05:40.263,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.

120
0:05:43.027,000 --> 0:05:46,000
My problem was monkey mind -- super loud, very incessant.

121
0:05:46.94,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Just thinking my way through problems doesn't work.

122
0:05:49.553,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.

123
0:05:51.602,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So I created a written exercise

124
0:05:53.593,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that I called "fear-setting," like goal-setting,

125
0:05:55.999,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for myself.

126
0:05:57.192,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It consists of three pages.

127
0:05:59.728,000 --> 0:06:,000
Super simple.

128
0:06:01.407,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The first page is right here.

129
0:06:03.641,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"What if I ...?"

130
0:06:05.841,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is whatever you fear,

131
0:06:07.422,000 --> 0:06:09,000
whatever is causing you anxiety,

132
0:06:09.529,000 --> 0:06:1,000
whatever you're putting off.

133
0:06:10.914,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It could be asking someone out,

134
0:06:12.425,000 --> 0:06:13,000
ending a relationship,

135
0:06:14.073,000 --> 0:06:17,000
asking for a promotion, quitting a job, starting a company.

136
0:06:17.135,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It could be anything.

137
0:06:18.316,000 --> 0:06:21,000
For me, it was taking my first vacation in four years

138
0:06:21.372,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and stepping away from my business for a month to go to London,

139
0:06:24.403,000 --> 0:06:27,000
where I could stay in a friend's room for free,

140
0:06:27.471,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business

141
0:06:30.201,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or shut it down.

142
0:06:32.345,000 --> 0:06:33,000
In the first column, "Define,"

143
0:06:34.327,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you're writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening

144
0:06:37.855,000 --> 0:06:38,000
if you take that step.

145
0:06:39.43,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You want 10 to 20.

146
0:06:41.016,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I won't go through all of them, but I'll give you two examples.

147
0:06:44.06,000 --> 0:06:47,000
One was, I'll go to London, it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,

148
0:06:47.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the whole thing will be a huge waste of time.

149
0:06:50.047,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Number two, I'll miss a letter from the IRS,

150
0:06:52.875,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I'll get audited

151
0:06:54.414,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or raided or shut down or some such.

152
0:06:57.405,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then you go to the "Prevent" column.

153
0:06:59.403,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In that column, you write down the answer to:

154
0:07:01.577,000 --> 0:07:04,000
What could I do to prevent each of these bullets from happening,

155
0:07:04.696,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or, at the very least, decrease the likelihood even a little bit?

156
0:07:08.649,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So for getting depressed in London,

157
0:07:11.068,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I could take a portable blue light with me

158
0:07:13.106,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.

159
0:07:15.125,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I knew that helped stave off depressive episodes.

160
0:07:17.804,000 --> 0:07:2,000
For the IRS bit, I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS

161
0:07:21.699,000 --> 0:07:23,000
so the paperwork would go to my accountant

162
0:07:23.79,000 --> 0:07:24,000
instead of to my UPS address.

163
0:07:25.767,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Easy-peasy.

164
0:07:27.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Then we go to "Repair."

165
0:07:30.058,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So if the worst-case scenarios happen,

166
0:07:32.552,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit,

167
0:07:35.542,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or who could you ask for help?

168
0:07:38.251,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So in the first case, London,

169
0:07:39.764,000 --> 0:07:42,000
well, I could fork over some money, fly to Spain, get some sun --

170
0:07:43.463,000 --> 0:07:45,000
undo the damage, if I got into a funk.

171
0:07:46.134,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In the case of missing a letter from the IRS,

172
0:07:48.567,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I could call a friend who is a lawyer

173
0:07:51.032,000 --> 0:07:53,000
or ask, say, a professor of law

174
0:07:54.597,000 --> 0:07:55,000
what they would recommend,

175
0:07:55.922,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who I should talk to, how had people handled this in the past.

176
0:07:59.142,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So one question to keep in mind as you're doing this first page is:

177
0:08:03.203,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Has anyone else in the history of time

178
0:08:05.384,000 --> 0:08:07,000
less intelligent or less driven

179
0:08:07.515,000 --> 0:08:08,000
figured this out?

180
0:08:09.203,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Chances are, the answer is "Yes."

181
0:08:11.523,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:12.549,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The second page is simple:

183
0:08:16.073,000 --> 0:08:19,000
What might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success?

184
0:08:19.518,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You can see we're playing up the fears

185
0:08:21.353,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and really taking a conservative look at the upside.

186
0:08:24.744,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So if you attempted whatever you're considering,

187
0:08:27.134,000 --> 0:08:29,000
might you build confidence, develop skills,

188
0:08:29.342,000 --> 0:08:31,000
emotionally, financially, otherwise?

189
0:08:32.148,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What might be the benefits of, say, a base hit?

190
0:08:34.911,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.

191
0:08:37.002,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Page three.

192
0:08:38.572,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This might be the most important, so don't skip it:

193
0:08:41.008,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"The Cost of Inaction."

194
0:08:42.582,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong

195
0:08:45.514,000 --> 0:08:48,000
if we try something new, say, ask for a raise.

196
0:08:48.927,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What we don't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo --

197
0:08:54.549,000 --> 0:08:55,000
not changing anything.

198
0:08:56.779,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So you should ask yourself,

199
0:08:58.654,000 --> 0:09:01,000
if I avoid this action or decision

200
0:09:02.862,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and actions and decisions like it,

201
0:09:05.409,000 --> 0:09:09,000
what might my life look like in, say, six months, 12 months, three years?

202
0:09:10.19,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Any further out, it starts to seem intangible.

203
0:09:12.702,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And really get detailed -- again, emotionally, financially,

204
0:09:16.573,000 --> 0:09:17,000
physically, whatever.

205
0:09:18.391,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And when I did this, it painted a terrifying picture.

206
0:09:21.118,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I was self-medicating,

207
0:09:23.237,000 --> 0:09:26,000
my business was going to implode at any moment at all times,

208
0:09:27.022,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if I didn't step away.

209
0:09:28.211,000 --> 0:09:3,000
My relationships were fraying or failing.

210
0:09:30.768,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me.

211
0:09:35.951,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Those are the three pages. That's it. That's fear-setting.

212
0:09:38.766,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And after this, I realized that on a scale of one to 10,

213
0:09:42.381,000 --> 0:09:45,000
one being minimal impact, 10 being maximal impact,

214
0:09:45.972,000 --> 0:09:46,000
if I took the trip, I was risking

215
0:09:47.638,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a one to three of temporary and reversible pain

216
0:09:50.996,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for an eight to 10 of positive, life-changing impact

217
0:09:55.031,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that could be a semi-permanent.

218
0:09:57.209,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So I took the trip.

219
0:09:59.007,000 --> 0:10:,000
None of the disasters came to pass.

220
0:10:00.806,000 --> 0:10:01,000
There were some hiccups, sure.

221
0:10:02.325,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I was able to extricate myself from the business.

222
0:10:04.891,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world,

223
0:10:08.773,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that became the basis for my first book,

224
0:10:11.003,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that leads me here today.

225
0:10:12.504,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I can trace all of my biggest wins

226
0:10:15.86,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and all of my biggest disasters averted

227
0:10:18.787,000 --> 0:10:19,000
back to doing fear-setting

228
0:10:20.693,000 --> 0:10:21,000
at least once a quarter.

229
0:10:23.06,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's not a panacea.

230
0:10:24.253,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You'll find that some of your fears are very well-founded.

231
0:10:27.167,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:28.246,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But you shouldn't conclude that

233
0:10:29.921,000 --> 0:10:31,000
without first putting them under a microscope.

234
0:10:33.144,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it doesn't make all the hard times, the hard choices, easy,

235
0:10:36.377,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but it can make a lot of them easier.

236
0:10:39.005,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'd like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.

237
0:10:43.961,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is Jerzy Gregorek.

238
0:10:46.622,000 --> 0:10:49,000
He is a four-time world champion in Olympic weightlifting,

239
0:10:50.075,000 --> 0:10:51,000
political refugee,

240
0:10:51.473,000 --> 0:10:52,000
published poet,

241
0:10:53.366,000 --> 0:10:54,000
62 years old.

242
0:10:54.779,000 --> 0:10:57,000
He can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room.

243
0:10:59.257,000 --> 0:11:,000
He's an impressive guy.

244
0:11:00.483,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I spent a lot of time on his stoa, his porch,

245
0:11:02.771,000 --> 0:11:04,000
asking life and training advice.

246
0:11:05.988,000 --> 0:11:08,000
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,

247
0:11:09.196,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which was a nonviolent movement for social change

248
0:11:11.886,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that was violently suppressed by the government.

249
0:11:14.687,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He lost his career as a firefighter.

250
0:11:16.757,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Then his mentor, a priest, was kidnapped, tortured, killed

251
0:11:19.902,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and thrown into a river.

252
0:11:21.56,000 --> 0:11:22,000
He was then threatened.

253
0:11:22.798,000 --> 0:11:25,000
He and his wife had to flee Poland, bounce from country to country

254
0:11:25.98,000 --> 0:11:27,000
until they landed in the US with next to nothing,

255
0:11:28.458,000 --> 0:11:29,000
sleeping on floors.

256
0:11:30.495,000 --> 0:11:33,000
He now lives in Woodside, California, in a very nice place,

257
0:11:34.306,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and of the 10,000-plus people I've met in my life,

258
0:11:36.955,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I would put him in the top 10,

259
0:11:39.263,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in terms of success and happiness.

260
0:11:42.391,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And there's a punchline coming, so pay attention.

261
0:11:44.742,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I sent him a text a few weeks ago,

262
0:11:46.629,000 --> 0:11:48,000
asking him: Had he ever read any Stoic philosophy?

263
0:11:49.448,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And he replied with two pages of text.

264
0:11:51.87,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This is very unlike him. He is a terse dude.

265
0:11:54.139,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

266
0:11:55.655,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And not only was he familiar with stoicism,

267
0:11:58.74,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but he pointed out, for all of his most important decisions,

268
0:12:02.158,000 --> 0:12:03,000
his inflection points,

269
0:12:03.689,000 --> 0:12:06,000
when he stood up for his principles and ethics,

270
0:12:07.962,000 --> 0:12:1,000
how he had used stoicism and something akin to fear-setting,

271
0:12:11.088,000 --> 0:12:12,000
which blew my mind.

272
0:12:12.274,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And he closed with two things.

273
0:12:13.945,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Number one: he couldn't imagine any life more beautiful

274
0:12:17.696,000 --> 0:12:18,000
than that of a Stoic.

275
0:12:20.633,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And the last was his mantra, which he applies to everything,

276
0:12:23.585,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and you can apply to everything:

277
0:12:27.224,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"Easy choices, hard life.

278
0:12:29.877,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Hard choices, easy life."

279
0:12:34.092,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The hard choices --

280
0:12:36.093,000 --> 0:12:39,000
what we most fear doing, asking, saying --

281
0:12:40.841,000 --> 0:12:43,000
these are very often exactly what we most need to do.

282
0:12:45.788,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And the biggest challenges and problems we face

283
0:12:48.301,000 --> 0:12:51,000
will never be solved with comfortable conversations,

284
0:12:51.42,000 --> 0:12:53,000
whether it's in your own head or with other people.

285
0:12:55.184,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So I encourage you to ask yourselves:

286
0:12:57.013,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Where in your lives right now

287
0:12:58.952,000 --> 0:13:02,000
might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals?

288
0:13:04.786,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Keeping in mind all the while, the words of Seneca:

289
0:13:08.015,000 --> 0:13:11,000
"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."

290
0:13:11.988,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Thank you very much.

291
0:13:13.184,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

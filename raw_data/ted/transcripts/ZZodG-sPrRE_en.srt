0:00:17.855,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that:

3
0:00:22.61,000 --> 0:00:25,000
life without the possibility of parole.

4
0:00:26.302,000 --> 0:00:27,000
For us lifers,

5
0:00:28.182,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as we call ourselves,

6
0:00:30.411,000 --> 0:00:32,000
our only chance for release

7
0:00:32.455,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is through commutation,

8
0:00:34.684,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which has only been granted to two women since 1989,

9
0:00:39.304,000 --> 0:00:41,000
close to 30 years ago.

10
0:00:42.105,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Our song, "This Is Not Our Home,"

11
0:00:45.959,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it tells of our experiences

12
0:00:47.887,000 --> 0:00:52,000
while doing life without the possibility of parole.

13
0:00:53.204,000 --> 0:00:57,000

14
0:01:12.29,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.

15
0:01:15.3,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm a grandmother.

16
0:01:18.327,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm a daughter.

17
0:01:21.206,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I have a son.

18
0:01:24.123,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm not an angel.

19
0:01:26.77,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'm not the devil.

20
0:01:29.928,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I came to jail

21
0:01:32.711,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when I was so young.

22
0:01:42.482,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I spend my time here

23
0:01:47.292,000 --> 0:01:52,000
inside these prison walls.

24
0:01:53.283,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Lost friends to death,

25
0:01:56.851,000 --> 0:02:02,000
saw some go home.

26
0:02:03.267,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Watch years pass,

27
0:02:07.09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
people come and go,

28
0:02:11.254,000 --> 0:02:21,000
while I do life without parole.

29
0:02:25.103,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.

30
0:02:30.378,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'm doing time here.

31
0:02:33.373,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is not my home.

32
0:02:35.254,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

33
0:02:40.316,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Will I see

34
0:02:44.449,000 --> 0:02:47,000
my family

35
0:02:48.187,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or die alone?

36
0:02:58.728,000 --> 0:03:01,000
As the years go by,

37
0:03:02.211,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I hold back my tears,

38
0:03:07.83,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because if I cry I'd give in to fear.

39
0:03:16.305,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I must be strong, have to hold on.

40
0:03:24.11,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Gotta get through

41
0:03:28.029,000 --> 0:03:32,000
another year.

42
0:03:32.378,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.

43
0:03:37.881,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm doing time here. This is not my home.

44
0:03:41.573,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

45
0:03:46.658,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Will I see

46
0:03:51.13,000 --> 0:03:54,000
my family

47
0:03:54.25,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or die alone?

48
0:04:04.397,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,

49
0:04:08.669,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.

50
0:04:13.244,000 --> 0:04:16,000
All I'm asking is for forgiveness.

51
0:04:16.982,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.

52
0:04:28.731,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Is there a place for me

53
0:04:34.605,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in the world out there?

54
0:04:38.901,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Will they ever know or care that I'm chained?

55
0:04:47.246,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Is there redemption for the sin of my younger days?

56
0:04:54.363,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Because I've changed.

57
0:04:58.308,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Lord knows I've changed.

58
0:05:02.39,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.

59
0:05:07.596,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I'm doing time here. This is not my home.

60
0:05:10.916,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

61
0:05:15.63,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Will I see

62
0:05:19.53,000 --> 0:05:22,000
my family

63
0:05:22.572,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or die alone?

64
0:05:31.604,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Will I see

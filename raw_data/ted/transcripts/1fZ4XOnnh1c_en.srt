1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to share with you the story

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
as to how I have become

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In November of 2003,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was invited to take part

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
46664 Foundation --

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And 46664 is the number

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
onstage, having the time of my life.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The next day, all the artists were invited

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to join Mandela in Robben Island,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
where he was going to give a conference

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to the world's press,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
standing in front of his former prison cell.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You can see the bars of the window there.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In that moment in time,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Mandela told the world's press

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that there was a virtual genocide

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
taking place in his country;

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that post-apartheid

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Rainbow Nation,

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and that the front line victims,

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the most vulnerable of all,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
were women and children.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This was a huge impact on my mind,

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because I am a woman and I am a mother,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I hadn't realized

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that the HIV/AIDS pandemic

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
was directly affecting women in such a way.

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when I left Capetown,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I told myself, "This is going to be something

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that I have to talk about.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I have to serve."

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, subsequently

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I participated in every single

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
46664 event

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I could take part in

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and gave news conferences,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
interviews,

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
talking and using my platform as a musician,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
with my commitment to Mandela --

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
out of respect for the tremendous,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
unbelievable work that he had done.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But do they all know

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
about what has been taking place in South Africa,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
his country,

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the country that had one of the highest incidents

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of transmission of the virus?

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I think that if I went out into the street now

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and I told people what was happening there,

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they would be shocked.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to have met Zackie Achmat,

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
an incredible campaigner and activist.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I met him at a 46664 event.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is a tool --

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
this tells you I am in solidarity

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with people who have HIV,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
people who are living with HIV.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It doesn't have to be in the closet."

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I'm very proud to be a member

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of that incredible organization.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's a grassroots campaign

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with 80 percent membership being women,

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
most of whom are HIV-positive.

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They work in the field.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They have tremendous outreach

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the people who are living directly

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with the effects of the virus.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They have education programs.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They bring out the issues of stigma.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's quite extraordinary what they do.

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And yes, my SING Campaign

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
has supported Treatment Action Campaign

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and to try to also raise funds.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and the incredible work that they do,

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So this is my SING Campaign.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
SING Campaign is basically just me

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and about three or four wonderful people

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who help to support me.

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I've traveled all over the world

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the last two and a half years --

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I went to about 12 different countries.

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
getting a nice, fat check;

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
who ended up in tears

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because I use film clips

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that people are tending to avoid,

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because they are fatigued,

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
attended that concert

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I had an opportunity to meet with him,

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and he gave his absolute commitment

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to try to making a change,

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is absolutely necessary.

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is in the Scottish Parliament.

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I've subsequently become an envoy

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for Scotland and HIV.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I was showing them my experiences

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and trying to, again, raise awareness.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And once again, in Edinburgh

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because of their family being affected

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
by the AIDS virus.

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
he's the director of UNAIDS.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And I'm very honored

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
by the fact that Michel invited me,

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
only a few months ago,

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and broadening my outreach.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The message that UNAIDS

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are currently sending out to the world

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
of the transmission of the virus

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
from mother to child by 2015.

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's a very ambitious goal

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
This can happen.

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And here I am with a pregnant woman,

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who is HIV positive

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because we know that that young woman

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is receiving treatment

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so her life can be extended

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And her baby will receive PMTCT,

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which will mean that that baby

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
can be born free of the virus.

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now that is prevention

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
at the very beginning of life.

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's one way to start looking at intervention

159
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
with the AIDS pandemic.

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, I just would like to finish off

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to tell you the little story

162
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
about Avelile.

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is Avelile --

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
she goes with me wherever I go.

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I tell her story to everyone

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because she represents

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
one of millions

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of HIV/AIDS orphans.

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Avelile's mother

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
had HIV virus --

171
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
she died

172
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
from AIDS-related illness.

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Avelile had the virus,

174
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
she was born with the virus.

175
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And here she is at seven years old,

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
At this point in her life,

178
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS

179
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and had pneumonia.

180
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape

181
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.

182
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.

183
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They put her on very special nutritious diet

184
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and took great care of her.

185
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --

186
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.

187
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter

188
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and left us feeling very resonant

189
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
with this direct experience, this one child,

190
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you know, that story.

191
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Five months later,

192
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we went back to South Africa

193
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to meet Avelile again.

194
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I'm getting --

195
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.

196
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is the transformation that took place.

198
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Isn't it extraordinary?

199
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Applause)

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
That round of applause is actually

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So, I would like to say to you,

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
each one in the audience,

205
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if you feel that every mother

206
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and every child in the world

207
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
has the right to have access

208
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to good nutrition and good medical care,

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
specifically five and six,

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
should be absolutely committed to

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
by all governments around the world --

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
especially in sub-Saharan Africa --

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
could you please stand up.

215
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
I think that's fair to say,

216
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it's almost everyone in the hall.

217
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Thank you very much.

218
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

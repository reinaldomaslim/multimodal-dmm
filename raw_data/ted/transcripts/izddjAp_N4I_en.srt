1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So there are a few things

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We stand in elections; we vote in elections;

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we observe elections.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Our democracies rely on elections.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We all understand why we have elections,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and we all leave the house on the same day

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to go and vote.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We cherish the opportunity to have our say,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to help decide the future of the country.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The fundamental idea is that politicians

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are given mandate to speak for us,

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to make decisions on our behalf

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that affect us all.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well unfortunately, power corrupts,

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and so people will do lots of things

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to get power and to stay in power,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
including doing bad things to elections.

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You see, even if the idea

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of the election is perfect,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
running a countrywide election is a big project,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and big projects are messy.

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Whenever there is an election,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it seems like something always goes wrong,

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
someone tries to cheat,

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or something goes accidentally awry --

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a ballot box goes missing here,

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
chads are left hanging over here.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong,

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we have all these procedures around the election.

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So for example, you come to the polling station,

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and a poll station worker asks for your ID

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
before giving you a ballot form

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and asking you to go into a voting booth

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to fill out your vote.

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
into the ballot box

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where it mixes with all the other votes,

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
so that no one knows how you voted.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is what happens after that,

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
after you drop your vote into the ballot box.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And most people would go home

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and feel sure that their vote has been counted,

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because they trust

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that the election system works.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They trust that election workers and election observers

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The ballot boxes go to counting places.

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They're unsealed and the votes are poured out

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and laboriously counted.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Most of us have to trust

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that that happens correctly for our own vote,

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we all have to trust that that happens correctly

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for all the votes in the election.

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So we have to trust a lot of people.

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We have to trust a lot of procedures.

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And sometimes we even have to trust computers.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
casting hundreds of millions of votes,

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
all to be counted correctly

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and all the things that can possibly go wrong

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
causing all these bad headlines,

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of trying to make elections better.

67
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well in the face of all these bad headlines,

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
researchers have taken a step back

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and thought about how we can do elections differently.

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.

71
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the big picture is this:

72
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
elections should be verifiable.

73
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Voters should be able to check

74
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that their votes are counted correctly,

75
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
without breaking election secrecy,

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which is so very important.

77
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And that's the tough part.

78
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
How do we make an election system completely verifiable

79
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
while keeping the votes

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
absolutely secret?

81
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, the way we've come up with

82
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
uses computers

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but doesn't depend on them.

84
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And the secret is the ballot form.

85
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And if you look closely at these ballot forms,

86
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you'll notice that the candidate list

87
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is in a different order on each one.

88
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them

89
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and then remove the candidate list,

90
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining

91
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
what your vote is for.

92
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in the form of this 2D barcode

94
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
on the right.

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And there's some complicated cryptography

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
going on in there,

97
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but what's not complicated

98
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is voting with one of these forms.

99
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and then we'll use the paper for verification.

101
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So this is how you vote.

102
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You get one of these ballot forms at random,

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and then you go into the voting booth,

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and you mark your choices,

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and you tear along a perforation.

106
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And you shred the candidate list.

107
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --

108
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
this is your encrypted vote.

109
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So you let a poll station worker

110
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
scan your encrypted vote.

111
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And because it's encrypted,

112
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it can be submitted, stored

113
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and counted centrally

114
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and displayed on a website

115
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for anyone to see, including you.

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So you take this encrypted vote

117
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
home as your receipt.

118
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And after the close of the election,

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you can check that your vote was counted

120
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by comparing your receipt

121
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to the vote on the website.

122
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And remember, the vote is encrypted

123
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from the moment you leave the voting booth,

124
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,

125
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they will not be able to.

126
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
If the government wants to find out how you voted,

127
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they won't be able to.

128
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
No hacker can break in

129
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and find out how you voted.

130
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
No hacker can break in and change your vote,

131
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because then it won't match your receipt.

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Votes can't go missing

133
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because then you won't find yours when you look for it.

134
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But the election magic doesn't stop there.

135
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Instead, we want to make the whole process

136
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
so transparent

137
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that news media and international observers

138
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and anyone who wants to

139
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
can download all the election data

140
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and do the count themselves.

141
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They can check

143
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that the announced result of the election

144
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is the correct one.

145
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And these are elections

146
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by the people, for the people.

147
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So the next step for our democracies

148
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
are transparent

149
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and verifiable elections.

150
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Thank you.

151
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

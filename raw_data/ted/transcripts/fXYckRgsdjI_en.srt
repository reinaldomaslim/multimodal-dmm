1
0:00:19.051,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it's the one that I can least take for granted.

3
0:00:25.98,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.

4
0:00:28.905,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.

5
0:00:32.032,000 --> 0:00:35,000
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun --

6
0:00:35.69,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:36.732,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,

8
0:00:38.845,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty

9
0:00:41.693,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.

10
0:00:43.549,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They handed out these dark plastic viewers

11
0:00:46.109,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that allowed us to look directly at the sun

12
0:00:48.182,000 --> 0:00:49,000
without damaging our eyes.

13
0:00:49.473,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But Dad got really scared; he didn't want us doing that.

14
0:00:52.233,000 --> 0:00:54,000
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers,

15
0:00:55.115,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.

16
0:00:58.799,000 --> 0:01:,000
I thought this was a little strange at the time.

17
0:01:01.093,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What I didn't know at the time

18
0:01:02.585,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.

19
0:01:05.667,000 --> 0:01:07,000
When he and his sister Martha were just very little,

20
0:01:08.35,000 --> 0:01:1,000
their mom took them out to see a total eclipse --

21
0:01:10.852,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or actually, a solar eclipse --

22
0:01:12.407,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and not long after that, both of them started losing their eyesight.

23
0:01:16.712,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness

24
0:01:20.198,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was most likely some sort of bacterial infection.

25
0:01:23.03,000 --> 0:01:25,000
As near as we can tell, it had nothing whatsoever to do

26
0:01:25.685,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with that solar eclipse,

27
0:01:27.632,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave

28
0:01:30.324,000 --> 0:01:31,000
thinking it was her fault.

29
0:01:32.847,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,

30
0:01:35.848,000 --> 0:01:36,000
married my mom,

31
0:01:37.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts,

32
0:01:39.285,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775,

33
0:01:42.899,000 --> 0:01:45,000
although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.

34
0:01:45.998,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He got a job working for Raytheon designing guidance systems,

35
0:01:49.596,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days --

36
0:01:52.672,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so, the equivalent of Silicon Valley in the '70s.

37
0:01:55.913,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy;

38
0:01:58.296,000 --> 0:02:01,000
he just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II

39
0:02:01.465,000 --> 0:02:02,000
on account of his handicap,

40
0:02:03.139,000 --> 0:02:04,000
although they did let him get through

41
0:02:04.945,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the several-hour-long army physical exam

42
0:02:08.706,000 --> 0:02:11,000
before they got to the very last test, which was for vision.

43
0:02:11.752,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:14.418,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So Dad started racking up all of these patents

45
0:02:17.593,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.

46
0:02:21.086,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal.

47
0:02:25.673,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As a kid, I watched a lot of television

48
0:02:27.592,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology

49
0:02:31.254,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the space program and a little bit of politics.

50
0:02:33.798,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I played a lot of chess.

51
0:02:35.042,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But at the age of 14, a friend got me interested in comic books,

52
0:02:38.209,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.

53
0:02:41.476,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, here's my dad:

54
0:02:43.284,000 --> 0:02:48,000
he's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.

55
0:02:49.185,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So, he has four kids, right?

56
0:02:51.008,000 --> 0:02:53,000
One grows up to become a computer scientist,

57
0:02:53.136,000 --> 0:02:54,000
one grows up to join the Navy,

58
0:02:55.088,000 --> 0:02:57,000
one grows up to become an engineer ...

59
0:02:57.354,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And then there's me: the comic book artist.

60
0:03:00.338,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:04.092,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Which, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen,

62
0:03:06.804,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor,

63
0:03:09.29,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.

64
0:03:11.649,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:12.902,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Right? It's true.

66
0:03:14.089,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:16.767,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.

68
0:03:19.126,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist,

69
0:03:21.302,000 --> 0:03:24,000
even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever;

70
0:03:24.613,000 --> 0:03:25,000
everything he saw was just a blur.

71
0:03:26.304,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith,"

72
0:03:29.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me

73
0:03:31.656,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that it does for other people.

74
0:03:33.153,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved,

75
0:03:36.321,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.

76
0:03:40.07,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I tend to like science,

77
0:03:41.521,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.

78
0:03:46.981,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But there's a middle ground, too --

79
0:03:49.133,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage

80
0:03:52.712,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and his steam-driven computers that were never built.

81
0:03:56.164,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind

82
0:03:59.237,000 --> 0:04:,000
except for Ada Lovelace,

83
0:04:01.49,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.

84
0:04:05.308,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Vannevar Bush with his memex --

85
0:04:07.728,000 --> 0:04:09,000
this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips --

86
0:04:10.729,000 --> 0:04:11,000
he had this vision.

87
0:04:12.281,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I think a lot of people in his day

88
0:04:14.147,000 --> 0:04:15,000
probably thought he was a bit of a kook.

89
0:04:16.11,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say,

90
0:04:18.549,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm --

91
0:04:20.794,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:21.841,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But that's not the point; he understood the shape of the future.

93
0:04:24.951,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.

94
0:04:29.565,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Same thing: he understood the shape of the future,

95
0:04:32.458,000 --> 0:04:35,000
even though it was something that would only be implemented

96
0:04:36.084,000 --> 0:04:37,000
by people much later.

97
0:04:37.499,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.

98
0:04:40.242,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.

99
0:04:43.101,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Or even the people who actually pulled it off,

100
0:04:45.317,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston,

101
0:04:47.951,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who just would sketch out these structures

102
0:04:50.887,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of what would eventually become a worldwide network,

103
0:04:53.447,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers

104
0:04:57.089,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's --

105
0:04:59.411,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,

106
0:05:01.825,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred

107
0:05:05.082,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and listening to Gladys Knight & The Pips

108
0:05:07.206,000 --> 0:05:09,000
singing "Midnight Train to Georgia" --

109
0:05:09.398,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:10.425,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in my dad's big easy chair, you know?

111
0:05:12.291,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So, three types of vision, right?

112
0:05:14.252,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Vision based on what one cannot see,

113
0:05:17.253,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the vision of that unseen and unknowable.

114
0:05:20.046,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.

115
0:05:23.53,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And this third kind, a vision of something which can be, which may be,

116
0:05:30.079,000 --> 0:05:33,000
based on knowledge but is, as yet, unproven.

117
0:05:33.807,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people

118
0:05:35.885,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who are pursuing that sort of vision in science,

119
0:05:38.227,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics,

120
0:05:41.205,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it's even true in personal endeavors.

121
0:05:43.417,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles:

122
0:05:46.09,000 --> 0:05:47,000
learn from everyone;

123
0:05:47.313,000 --> 0:05:48,000
follow no one;

124
0:05:49.141,000 --> 0:05:5,000
watch for patterns;

125
0:05:50.989,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and work like hell.

126
0:05:52.192,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I think these are the four principles that go into this.

127
0:05:55.236,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And it's that third one, especially,

128
0:05:57.091,000 --> 0:06:,000
where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.

129
0:06:00.759,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world,

130
0:06:04.158,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is, I think, only one of four different ways

131
0:06:06.314,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.

132
0:06:09.054,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude

133
0:06:13.561,000 --> 0:06:15,000
towards trying to understand how it works.

134
0:06:15.644,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Then there's another, more classical attitude

135
0:06:17.899,000 --> 0:06:19,000
which embraces beauty and craft;

136
0:06:20.506,000 --> 0:06:24,000
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content;

137
0:06:24.562,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and then another, which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience

138
0:06:28.533,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and honesty and rawness.

139
0:06:29.975,000 --> 0:06:31,000
These are four very different ways of looking at the world.

140
0:06:32.803,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I even gave them names:

141
0:06:33.979,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the classicist, the animist, the formalist and iconoclast.

142
0:06:36.75,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Interestingly, they seem to correspond more or less

143
0:06:39.314,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.

144
0:06:41.909,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight

145
0:06:44.721,000 --> 0:06:45,000
on left and the right;

146
0:06:45.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.

147
0:06:48.484,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form,

148
0:06:51.151,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and then beauty and truth.

149
0:06:52.416,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And it probably applies just as much to music and movies and fine art,

150
0:06:56.526,000 --> 0:06:58,000
which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all,

151
0:06:59.527,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or, for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme

152
0:07:02.432,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of "Inspired by Nature,"

153
0:07:03.788,000 --> 0:07:05,000
except to the extent of the fable of the frog

154
0:07:06.492,000 --> 0:07:09,000
who gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river

155
0:07:09.784,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because the scorpion promises not to sting him,

156
0:07:12.018,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but the scorpion stings him anyway and they both die,

157
0:07:14.576,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but not before the frog asks him why, and the scorpion says,

158
0:07:17.489,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"Because it's my nature."

159
0:07:18.712,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In that sense, yes.

160
0:07:19.891,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So this was my nature.

162
0:07:24.514,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The thing was, I saw that the route I took

163
0:07:27.652,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to discovering this focus in my work

164
0:07:31.521,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and who I was --

165
0:07:33.389,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I saw it as just this road to discovery.

166
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Actually, it was just me embracing my nature,

167
0:07:37.887,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree, after all.

168
0:07:43.87,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?

169
0:07:48.87,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them,

170
0:07:52.285,000 --> 0:07:53,000
almost immediately.

171
0:07:53.46,000 --> 0:07:56,000
One of the most important things about comics that I discovered

172
0:07:56.566,000 --> 0:07:57,000
was that comics are a visual medium,

173
0:07:58.437,000 --> 0:08:,000
but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.

174
0:08:01.403,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words,

175
0:08:05.494,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and the different symbols and everything in between

176
0:08:08.036,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that comics presents,

177
0:08:09.247,000 --> 0:08:11,000
are all funneled through the single conduit, a vision.

178
0:08:11.839,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So we have things like resemblance,

179
0:08:13.84,000 --> 0:08:16,000
where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted

180
0:08:17.104,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in a couple of different directions:

181
0:08:18.89,000 --> 0:08:21,000
abstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning,

182
0:08:22.514,000 --> 0:08:24,000
or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning

183
0:08:25.255,000 --> 0:08:26,000
towards the picture plane.

184
0:08:26.535,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Put all these three together, and you have a nice little map

185
0:08:29.393,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of the entire boundary of visual iconography,

186
0:08:31.532,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which comics can embrace.

187
0:08:33.341,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And if you move to the right you also get language,

188
0:08:36.203,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because that's abstracting even further from resemblance,

189
0:08:39.204,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but still maintaining meaning.

190
0:08:41.807,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Vision is called upon to represent sound

191
0:08:44.581,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and to understand the common properties of those two

192
0:08:48.176,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and their common heritage as well;

193
0:08:50.34,000 --> 0:08:52,000
also, to try to represent the texture of sound

194
0:08:52.749,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to capture its essential character through visuals.

195
0:08:57.466,000 --> 0:09:01,000
There's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.

196
0:09:02.489,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Comics is a kind of call and response,

197
0:09:04.41,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels,

198
0:09:07.576,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.

199
0:09:11.355,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Also, another sense which comics' vision represents,

200
0:09:15.644,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and that's time.

201
0:09:17.314,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.

202
0:09:20.982,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.

203
0:09:24.276,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics,

204
0:09:27.936,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes

205
0:09:30.881,000 --> 0:09:31,000
other sorts of forms,

206
0:09:32.423,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I found some in history.

207
0:09:34.936,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You can see this same principle operating

208
0:09:37.644,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in these ancient versions of the same idea.

209
0:09:40.652,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What's happening is,

210
0:09:41.829,000 --> 0:09:43,000
an art form is colliding with a given technology,

211
0:09:44.195,000 --> 0:09:45,000
whether it's paint on stone,

212
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like the Tomb of Menna the Scribe in ancient Egypt,

213
0:09:47.981,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column,

214
0:09:50.609,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or a 200-foot-long embroidery,

215
0:09:52.661,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or painted deerskin and tree bark

216
0:09:54.662,000 --> 0:09:56,000
running across 88 accordion-folded pages.

217
0:09:57.124,000 --> 0:09:59,000
What's interesting is, once you hit "print" --

218
0:09:59.313,000 --> 0:10:,000
and this is from 1450, by the way --

219
0:10:01.194,000 --> 0:10:04,000
all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves:

220
0:10:04.351,000 --> 0:10:05,000
rectilinear panel arrangements,

221
0:10:05.891,000 --> 0:10:06,000
simple line drawings without tone,

222
0:10:07.683,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and a left-to-right reading sequence.

223
0:10:11.093,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions,

224
0:10:16.125,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.

225
0:10:19.839,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book,

226
0:10:23.298,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I had to do a little bit of typesetting,

227
0:10:25.238,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it,

228
0:10:27.93,000 --> 0:10:28,000
so I bought a computer.

229
0:10:29.199,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And it was just a little thing --

230
0:10:30.897,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it wasn't good for much except text entry --

231
0:10:33.087,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but my father had told me about Moore's law back in the '70s,

232
0:10:36.951,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I knew what was coming.

233
0:10:38.879,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And so, I kept my eyes peeled

234
0:10:41.601,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to see if the sort of changes that happened

235
0:10:43.666,000 --> 0:10:45,000
when we went from pre-print comics to print comics

236
0:10:46.3,000 --> 0:10:48,000
would happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.

237
0:10:49.665,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So, one of the first things proposed

238
0:10:51.437,000 --> 0:10:53,000
was that we could mix the visuals of comics

239
0:10:53.815,000 --> 0:10:55,000
with the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs

240
0:10:56.65,000 --> 0:10:57,000
being made in those days.

241
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This was even before the Web.

242
0:10:59.483,000 --> 0:11:,000
And one of the first things they did was,

243
0:11:01.468,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they tried to take the comics page as is

244
0:11:03.403,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and transplant it to monitors,

245
0:11:04.887,000 --> 0:11:06,000
which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake

246
0:11:06.912,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of appropriating the shape of the previous technology

247
0:11:09.435,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as the content of the new technology.

248
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And so, what they would do is have these comic pages

249
0:11:14.024,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that resemble print comics pages,

250
0:11:15.683,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and they would introduce all this sound and motion.

251
0:11:18.123,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The problem was that if you go with this basic idea

252
0:11:21.388,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that space equals time in comics,

253
0:11:23.76,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion,

254
0:11:26.499,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time,

255
0:11:29.922,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they break with that continuity of presentation.

256
0:11:35.15,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Interactivity was another thing.

257
0:11:36.716,000 --> 0:11:38,000
There were hypertext comics, but the thing about hypertext

258
0:11:39.507,000 --> 0:11:41,000
is that everything in hypertext is either here, not here,

259
0:11:42.24,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or connected to here;

260
0:11:43.422,000 --> 0:11:44,000
it's profoundly nonspatial.

261
0:11:44.796,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny

262
0:11:47.273,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives:

263
0:11:50.382,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it's all the same.

264
0:11:51.557,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

265
0:11:52.774,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But in comics,

266
0:11:55.65,000 --> 0:11:57,000
every aspect of the work, every element of the work,

267
0:11:58.544,000 --> 0:12:01,000
has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.

268
0:12:01.703,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So the question was:

269
0:12:02.895,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship

270
0:12:05.896,000 --> 0:12:07,000
while still taking advantage of all of the things

271
0:12:08.268,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that digital had to offer us?

272
0:12:09.935,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And I found my personal answer for this

273
0:12:11.99,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in those ancient comics that I was showing you.

274
0:12:14.324,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line,

275
0:12:17.688,000 --> 0:12:2,000
whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column

276
0:12:21.405,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or just straight left to right,

277
0:12:22.957,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages,

278
0:12:27.03,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the same thing is happening;

279
0:12:28.448,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that is, that the basic idea that as you move through space

280
0:12:31.258,000 --> 0:12:32,000
you move through time,

281
0:12:32.437,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is being carried out without any compromise,

282
0:12:34.545,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but there were compromises when print hit.

283
0:12:36.6,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments,

284
0:12:39.54,000 --> 0:12:42,000
so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again

285
0:12:42.783,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and again and again.

286
0:12:43.963,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I thought, OK, well, if that's true,

287
0:12:46.313,000 --> 0:12:48,000
is there any way, when we go beyond today's print,

288
0:12:49.244,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to somehow bring that back?

289
0:12:52.395,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?

290
0:12:57.656,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's a different shape, but other than that,

291
0:12:59.807,000 --> 0:13:,000
it's the same basic limitation.

292
0:13:01.736,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page,

293
0:13:05.299,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but not if you look at the monitor as a window.

294
0:13:08.021,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And that's what I propose,

295
0:13:09.292,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas,

296
0:13:12.433,000 --> 0:13:14,000
along the X axis and the Y axis

297
0:13:15.367,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and staircases.

298
0:13:17.164,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.

299
0:13:20.094,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.

300
0:13:23.536,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.

301
0:13:27.307,000 --> 0:13:28,000
X, Y and also Z.

302
0:13:30.569,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So I had all these notions.

303
0:13:31.915,000 --> 0:13:32,000
This was back in the late '90s,

304
0:13:33.447,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy,

305
0:13:36.302,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.

306
0:13:38.851,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I'm going to show you a couple now.

307
0:13:41.093,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jasen Lex.

308
0:13:47.966,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And notice what's going on here.

309
0:13:49.765,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation --

310
0:13:52.309,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that's what all of us are searching for.

311
0:13:54.31,000 --> 0:13:57,000
As media head into this new era,

312
0:13:57.514,000 --> 0:13:59,000
we are looking for mutations that are durable,

313
0:14:00.03,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that have some sort of staying power.

314
0:14:03.567,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium,

315
0:14:07.695,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.

316
0:14:11.03,000 --> 0:14:14,000
That's that entire comic you just saw, up on the screen right now.

317
0:14:14.225,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time,

318
0:14:17.308,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that's just where the technology is right now.

319
0:14:19.914,000 --> 0:14:2,000
As the technology evolves,

320
0:14:21.676,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as you get full immersive displays and whatnot,

321
0:14:24.684,000 --> 0:14:26,000
this sort of thing will only grow; it will adapt.

322
0:14:27.478,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It will adapt to its environment; it's a durable mutation.

323
0:14:33.055,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Here's another one.

324
0:14:34.244,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This is by Drew Weing; this is called

325
0:14:36.565,000 --> 0:14:39,000
"'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death of the Universe."

326
0:15:04.392,000 --> 0:15:05,000
See what's going on here

327
0:15:06.909,000 --> 0:15:09,000
as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas

328
0:15:12.165,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.

329
0:15:21.99,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We'll go by this a little quickly. You get the idea.

330
0:15:24.587,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I just want to get to the last panel.

331
0:15:32.375,000 --> 0:15:35,000
[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup! Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]

332
0:15:35.495,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Laughter)

333
0:15:36.582,000 --> 0:15:37,000
[Pup: Did either of you realize

334
0:15:38.206,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that eventually the universe will be nothing but a thin, cold gas

335
0:15:41.525,000 --> 0:15:42,000
spread across infinite, lonely space?]

336
0:15:43.509,000 --> 0:15:45,000
[Cat 1: Oh ... Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]

337
0:15:46.155,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Laughter)

338
0:15:49.847,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Just one more.

339
0:15:53.474,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Talk about your infinite canvas.

340
0:15:55.443,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.

341
0:15:58.593,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Why is this important?

342
0:16:01.228,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I think this is important because media --

343
0:16:04.727,000 --> 0:16:05,000
all media --

344
0:16:06.093,000 --> 0:16:08,000
provide us a window back into our world.

345
0:16:08.898,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Now, it could be that motion pictures and eventually, virtual reality,

346
0:16:13.244,000 --> 0:16:16,000
or something equivalent to it, some sort of immersive display,

347
0:16:16.447,000 --> 0:16:2,000
is going to provide us with our most efficient escape

348
0:16:20.588,000 --> 0:16:21,000
from the world that we're in.

349
0:16:22.03,000 --> 0:16:24,000
That's why most people turn to storytelling, to escape.

350
0:16:24.834,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But media provides us with a window back into the world we live in.

351
0:16:31.585,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And when media evolve

352
0:16:34.752,000 --> 0:16:38,000
so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique --

353
0:16:39.753,000 --> 0:16:42,000
because what you're looking at is comics cubed,

354
0:16:42.977,000 --> 0:16:44,000
you're looking at comics that are more comics-like

355
0:16:45.376,000 --> 0:16:46,000
than they've ever been before --

356
0:16:46.995,000 --> 0:16:48,000
when that happens, you provide people with multiple ways

357
0:16:49.671,000 --> 0:16:52,000
of reentering the world through different windows.

358
0:16:53.673,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world they live in

359
0:16:57.464,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and see its shape.

360
0:16:58.863,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That's why I think this is important.

361
0:17:00.664,000 --> 0:17:02,000
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.

362
0:17:02.743,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Thank you for having me.

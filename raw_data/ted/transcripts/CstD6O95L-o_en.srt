2
0:00:16.004,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I was about 16 years old

3
0:00:19.002,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,

4
0:00:22.701,000 --> 0:00:24,000
looking for a movie to watch on HBO --

5
0:00:25.231,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?

6
0:00:27.744,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,

7
0:00:32.745,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"

8
0:00:35.457,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,

9
0:00:39.029,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.

10
0:00:43.146,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.

11
0:00:48.899,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."

12
0:00:52.227,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.

13
0:00:58.973,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about.

14
0:01:02.037,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.

15
0:01:07.193,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part.

16
0:01:12.786,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.

17
0:01:17.999,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,

18
0:01:24.349,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it stuck with me for the past 25 years.

19
0:01:27.549,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother

20
0:01:32.658,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.

21
0:01:37.817,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand.

22
0:01:43.036,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,

23
0:01:49.072,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I can even pat myself on the back when necessary,

24
0:01:51.929,000 --> 0:01:55,000
all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.

25
0:01:56.428,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,

26
0:02:02.107,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."

27
0:02:06.556,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,

28
0:02:14.323,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,

29
0:02:19.684,000 --> 0:02:23,000
fighting for love.

30
0:02:23.982,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When I finally got to a place in my life

31
0:02:28.111,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,

32
0:02:31.734,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.

33
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was --

34
0:02:40.209,000 --> 0:02:43,000
gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.

35
0:02:43.427,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger

36
0:02:48.471,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear

37
0:02:51.081,000 --> 0:02:55,000
about who I was and the gay lifestyle.

38
0:02:55.95,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, I'm sitting here trying to figure out "the gay lifestyle," "the gay lifestyle,"

39
0:03:00.271,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.

40
0:03:04.683,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat

41
0:03:09.313,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to civilization than terrorism.

42
0:03:12.221,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That's when I got scared.

43
0:03:15.196,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,

44
0:03:22.318,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.

45
0:03:26.944,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

46
0:03:29.322,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,

47
0:03:34.245,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and I saw some things very disturbing.

48
0:03:38.465,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

49
0:03:42.301,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,

50
0:03:46.055,000 --> 0:03:48,000
starting with my mornings.

51
0:03:48.352,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I drink coffee.

52
0:03:51.398,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Not only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.

53
0:03:57.291,000 --> 0:04:,000
I get stuck in traffic --

54
0:04:00.933,000 --> 0:04:03,000
evil, evil traffic.

55
0:04:04.411,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.

56
0:04:07.583,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I look around, and I go, "My God, look at all these gay people!

57
0:04:10.849,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!

58
0:04:15.291,000 --> 0:04:21,000
My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"

59
0:04:21.517,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.

60
0:04:28.904,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.

61
0:04:34.281,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Any parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people --

62
0:04:39.222,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they eat two, three, four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous!

63
0:04:44.026,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is the gay lifestyle.

64
0:04:46.674,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,

65
0:04:53.461,000 --> 0:04:56,000
my partner and I, we get together

66
0:04:57.064,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.

67
0:05:03.219,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

68
0:05:07.043,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on "American Idol."

69
0:05:10.395,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on

70
0:05:14.613,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.

71
0:05:19.699,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.

72
0:05:24.069,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Run for your heterosexual lives, people.

73
0:05:27.934,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

74
0:05:36.328,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,

75
0:05:40.982,000 --> 0:05:43,000
he told me this story about penguins.

76
0:05:44.576,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.

77
0:05:48.027,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that

78
0:05:51.963,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,

79
0:05:56.316,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.

80
0:05:59.917,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.

81
0:06:06.533,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.

82
0:06:10.51,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And he says, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."

83
0:06:14.936,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,

84
0:06:20.475,000 --> 0:06:23,000
like, I don't know, a TEDx talk.

85
0:06:24.064,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.

86
0:06:28.05,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And sometimes I just wear it just because.

87
0:06:31.67,000 --> 0:06:35,000
How many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?

88
0:06:36.588,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You might be gay.

89
0:06:39.764,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

90
0:06:41.19,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.

91
0:06:47.739,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

92
0:06:54.004,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.

93
0:06:59.576,000 --> 0:07:02,000
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?

94
0:07:03.478,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.

95
0:07:08.644,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!

96
0:07:15.389,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It goes and goes and engulfs!

97
0:07:18.733,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's really quite silly, isn't it?

98
0:07:21.589,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say

99
0:07:28.973,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that he supports --

100
0:07:31.035,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Applause)

101
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that he supports marriage equality.

102
0:07:37.82,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history

103
0:07:42.39,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this --

104
0:07:47.436,000 --> 0:07:5,000
first to himself, and then to the rest of the world.

105
0:07:51.15,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's wonderful.

106
0:07:53.238,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But there's something that's been disturbing me since he

107
0:07:56.629,000 --> 0:07:59,000
made that remark just a short time ago.

108
0:08:00.366,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists

109
0:08:06.926,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that's on the gay agenda.

110
0:08:10.407,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.

111
0:08:16.12,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,

112
0:08:19.81,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.

113
0:08:24.295,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

114
0:08:25.985,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I've paid my dues on time,

115
0:08:28.767,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

116
0:08:31.316,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,

117
0:08:35.611,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.

118
0:08:38.952,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.

119
0:08:43.917,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,

120
0:08:49.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.

121
0:08:57.543,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this.

122
0:09:02.947,000 --> 0:09:07,000
When you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.

123
0:09:07.963,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,

124
0:09:11.834,000 --> 0:09:14,000
what exactly is in the gay agenda?

125
0:09:15.355,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What are these gays up to?

126
0:09:18.835,000 --> 0:09:2,000
What do they want?"

127
0:09:21.669,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen --

128
0:09:27.056,000 --> 0:09:31,000
now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy,

129
0:09:31.29,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the official copy, of the gay agenda.

130
0:09:36.723,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Music)

131
0:10:01.527,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The gay agenda, people!

132
0:10:04.498,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

133
0:10:08.435,000 --> 0:10:1,000
There it is!

134
0:10:10.487,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.

135
0:10:14.326,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Some of you may be calling it, what,

136
0:10:17.577,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?

137
0:10:20.721,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.

138
0:10:25.921,000 --> 0:10:29,000
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens

139
0:10:30.826,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it's all written down in plain sight.

140
0:10:34.731,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?

141
0:10:40.437,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?

142
0:10:44.646,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.

143
0:10:48.334,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But there it is. The gay agenda.

144
0:10:53.042,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Run for your heterosexual lives.

145
0:10:58.846,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that

146
0:11:05.578,000 --> 0:11:08,000
people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered

147
0:11:08.719,000 --> 0:11:1,000
can be kicked out of their apartments

148
0:11:10.811,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

149
0:11:14.947,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,

150
0:11:20.115,000 --> 0:11:25,000
because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.

151
0:11:25.957,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that

152
0:11:31.106,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

153
0:11:37.292,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Not based upon the quality of your work,

154
0:11:41.303,000 --> 0:11:45,000
how long you've been there, if you stink,

155
0:11:45.305,000 --> 0:11:51,000
just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.

156
0:11:51.978,000 --> 0:11:56,000
All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,

157
0:11:57.308,000 --> 0:12:,000
also known as the U.S. Constitution.

158
0:12:01.023,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Specifically, this little amendment right here:

159
0:12:04.695,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities

160
0:12:09.946,000 --> 0:12:13,000
of citizens of the United States."

161
0:12:14.184,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm looking at you, North Carolina.

162
0:12:17.225,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.

163
0:12:21.822,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,

164
0:12:27.133,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but the rights that were already written by these people --

165
0:12:31.309,000 --> 0:12:33,000
these elitists, if you will.

166
0:12:33.728,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Educated, well-dressed,

167
0:12:37.759,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

168
0:12:40.447,000 --> 0:12:42,000
some would dare say questionably dressed.

169
0:12:43.188,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

170
0:12:45.967,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Nonetheless, our forefathers, right?

171
0:12:49.749,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution --

172
0:12:53.985,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the gay agenda, if you will.

173
0:12:57.158,000 --> 0:13:02,000
All of that flies in the face of what they did.

174
0:13:02.481,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that

175
0:13:07.992,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.

176
0:13:13.334,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Because I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.

177
0:13:18.312,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.

178
0:13:22.871,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan --

179
0:13:28.298,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it's legal to fire someone

180
0:13:33.945,000 --> 0:13:36,000
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

181
0:13:37.839,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that it's legal to remove someone from their home

182
0:13:42.103,000 --> 0:13:46,000
because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

183
0:13:46.713,000 --> 0:13:49,000
then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality

184
0:13:50.701,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is not about stripping someone's rights away,

185
0:13:54.169,000 --> 0:13:58,000
it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.

186
0:13:58.749,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,

187
0:14:03.21,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that we've already agreed upon.

188
0:14:06.716,000 --> 0:14:11,000
There are people living in fear

189
0:14:12.023,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of losing their jobs

190
0:14:15.64,000 --> 0:14:2,000
so they don't show anyone who they really are

191
0:14:20.73,000 --> 0:14:24,000
right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;

192
0:14:25.535,000 --> 0:14:3,000
all those states that were clear, it's legal.

193
0:14:31.224,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If I could brag for a second,

194
0:14:34.448,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.

195
0:14:40.552,000 --> 0:14:42,000
He has a 4.0.

196
0:14:43.303,000 --> 0:14:49,000
He is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.

197
0:14:49.742,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He's a budding track star;

198
0:14:53.969,000 --> 0:14:59,000
he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.

199
0:15:00.43,000 --> 0:15:02,000
He volunteers.

200
0:15:02.933,000 --> 0:15:05,000
He prays before he eats.

201
0:15:06.168,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I would like to think, as his father -- and he lives with me primarily --

202
0:15:12.363,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that I had a little something to do with all of that.

203
0:15:16.28,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I would like to think that he's a good boy,

204
0:15:19.188,000 --> 0:15:23,000
a respectful young man. I would like to think that

205
0:15:23.555,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I've proven to be a capable father.

206
0:15:27.252,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,

207
0:15:31.005,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,

208
0:15:35.937,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I would be disqualified for only one reason:

209
0:15:39.536,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because I'm gay.

210
0:15:42.893,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.

211
0:15:47.696,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am

212
0:15:51.304,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.

213
0:15:57.136,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And that's not just about me,

214
0:16:01.171,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,

215
0:16:06.074,000 --> 0:16:11,000
who don't understand why what they are

216
0:16:11.233,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is so much more significant than who they are.

217
0:16:16.513,000 --> 0:16:21,000
This story just keeps playing over and over

218
0:16:21.89,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and over again in our country's history.

219
0:16:25.381,000 --> 0:16:28,000
There was a time in which, I don't know,

220
0:16:29.238,000 --> 0:16:33,000
people who were black couldn't have the same rights.

221
0:16:33.267,000 --> 0:16:38,000
People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.

222
0:16:38.582,000 --> 0:16:42,000
There was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,

223
0:16:43.372,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.

224
0:16:48.109,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We keep doing this over and over again.

225
0:16:51.463,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And so here we are, 2012,

226
0:16:56.047,000 --> 0:16:58,000
gay agenda,

227
0:16:58.376,000 --> 0:17:01,000
gay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad

228
0:17:02.244,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families

229
0:17:05.754,000 --> 0:17:09,000
because of what they are, not who they are.

230
0:17:10.425,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So when you hear the words "gay lifestyle" and "gay agenda" in the future,

231
0:17:17.069,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I encourage you to do two things:

232
0:17:20.474,000 --> 0:17:26,000
One, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,

233
0:17:26.759,000 --> 0:17:31,000
if you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.

234
0:17:31.882,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Look to your right.

235
0:17:35.038,000 --> 0:17:4,000
That person next to you is a brother, is a sister.

236
0:17:40.505,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And they should be treated with love and respect.

237
0:17:43.12,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Thank you.

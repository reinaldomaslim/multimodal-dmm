1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:34,000
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I wanted to visualize the story of life.

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But there were also revelations.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.

9
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth

10
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the way it was three billion years ago,

11
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
back before the sky turned blue.

12
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There's stromatolites down there --

13
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the first living things to capture photosynthesis --

14
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and it's the only place they still occur today.

15
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Going down there was like entering a time capsule,

16
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.

17
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites

18
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is what we all breathe today.

19
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.

20
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.

21
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's a story about you and me, nature and science.

22
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for

23
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a short, brief journey of life through time.

24
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...

25
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
solidifying into surface, molded by fire.

26
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.

27
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The moon was closer; things were different.

28
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.

29
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.

30
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.

31
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.

32
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.

33
0:03:55,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.

34
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It arises around cracks in the Earth.

35
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.

36
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...

37
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Growing living structures under an alien sky ...

38
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.

39
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And they changed the atmosphere.

40
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
A breath that's fossilized now as iron.

41
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.

42
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Life needs a membrane to contain itself

43
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so it can replicate and mutate.

44
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:18,000
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton

45
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with skeletons of silicon ...

46
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
circuit boards of the future.

47
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed

48
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:39,000
into more complex forms.

49
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It grew as light and oxygen increased.

50
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Life hardened and became defensive.

51
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.

52
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs,

53
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:18,000
among the first to leave the sea.

54
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.

55
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.

56
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.

57
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...

58
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:56,000
clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.

59
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
True land plants arose, leafless at first.

60
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.

61
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The fundamental forms of ferns followed,

62
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.

63
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Life flourished in swamps.

64
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.

65
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.

66
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It took time for life to break away from water,

67
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it still beckons all the time.

68
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.

69
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the dragons that arose are still among us today.

70
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,

71
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the center of Brazil,

72
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.

73
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.

74
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.

75
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:,000
And others fly today like echoes of the past.

76
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In birds, life gained new mobility.

77
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.

78
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.

79
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Water lilies were among the first.

80
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.

81
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,

82
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.

83
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.

84
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.

85
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.

86
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...

87
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:47,000
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.

88
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.

89
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.

90
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.

91
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.

92
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.

93
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.

94
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:41,000
When the skies cleared, a new world was born.

95
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:51,000
A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]

96
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
tenrecs, accustomed to the dark.

97
0:11:55,000 --> 0:12:01,000
New forms became bats. Civets.

98
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:11,000
New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.

99
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Grasslands created opportunities.

100
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Herd safety came with sharpened senses.

101
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.

102
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Some mammals turned back to water.

103
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.

104
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.

105
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:08,000
There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;

106
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.

107
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,

108
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
becoming lemurs not much later.

109
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.

110
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.

111
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,

112
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:11,000
sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.

113
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We're molded by the same life force.

114
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The blood veins in our hands

115
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.

116
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And our brains -- our celebrated brains --

117
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.

118
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.

119
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.

120
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,

121
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Mars is still not very far.

122
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.

123
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb

124
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:23,000
for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel

125
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.

126
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile

127
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly

128
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,

129
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and vice versa.

130
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.

131
0:15:52,000 --> 0:16:,000
We call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.

132
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.

133
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Applause)

134
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Thank you. Thank you.

2
0:00:16.248,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Today I have just one request.

3
0:00:19.243,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Please don't tell me I'm normal.

4
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.

5
0:00:27.009,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Remi is 22,

6
0:00:29.275,000 --> 0:00:31,000
tall and very handsome.

7
0:00:32.239,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He's speechless, but he communicates joy

8
0:00:36.167,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in a way that some of the best orators cannot.

9
0:00:40.45,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Remi knows what love is.

10
0:00:43.093,000 --> 0:00:47,000
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.

11
0:00:47.475,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.

12
0:00:50.995,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:

13
0:00:54.316,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He has never told a lie.

14
0:00:57.571,000 --> 0:00:59,000
When he sings songs from our childhood,

15
0:01:00.052,000 --> 0:01:02,000
attempting words that not even I could remember,

16
0:01:02.915,000 --> 0:01:04,000
he reminds me of one thing:

17
0:01:05.139,000 --> 0:01:07,000
how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful

18
0:01:07.692,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the unknown must be.

19
0:01:11.267,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.

20
0:01:17.004,000 --> 0:01:2,000
He has the most impeccable memory.

21
0:01:20.788,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He has a selective one, though.

22
0:01:23.336,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,

23
0:01:27.104,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,

24
0:01:30.394,000 --> 0:01:32,000
conversations we had when he was four,

25
0:01:32.793,000 --> 0:01:35,000
weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,

26
0:01:36.264,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and Lady Gaga's birthday.

27
0:01:39.672,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Don't they sound incredible?

28
0:01:42.409,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But most people don't agree.

29
0:01:45.433,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And in fact, because their minds don't fit

30
0:01:48.169,000 --> 0:01:5,000
into society's version of normal,

31
0:01:50.905,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they're often bypassed and misunderstood.

32
0:01:53.843,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul

33
0:01:57.609,000 --> 0:01:59,000
was that even though this was the case,

34
0:01:59.929,000 --> 0:02:01,000
although they were not seen as ordinary,

35
0:02:02.843,000 --> 0:02:04,000
this could only mean one thing:

36
0:02:05.355,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that they were extraordinary --

37
0:02:08.73,000 --> 0:02:12,000
autistic and extraordinary.

38
0:02:12.953,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"

39
0:02:17.404,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,

40
0:02:21.306,000 --> 0:02:24,000
learning and sometimes physical skills.

41
0:02:24.994,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It manifests in each individual differently,

42
0:02:27.809,000 --> 0:02:29,000
hence why Remi is so different from Sam.

43
0:02:30.49,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person

44
0:02:33.124,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of

45
0:02:35.994,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,

46
0:02:39.137,000 --> 0:02:42,000
there is no known cause or cure.

47
0:02:42.313,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,

48
0:02:45.578,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but I cannot recall a day without it.

49
0:02:48.657,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I was just three years old when my brother came along,

50
0:02:51.042,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I was so excited that

51
0:02:53.306,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I had a new being in my life.

52
0:02:56.409,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And after a few months went by,

53
0:02:59.138,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I realized that he was different.

54
0:03:01.523,000 --> 0:03:03,000
He screamed a lot.

55
0:03:03.729,000 --> 0:03:06,000
He didn't want to play like the other babies did,

56
0:03:06.816,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and in fact, he didn't seem

57
0:03:08.762,000 --> 0:03:1,000
very interested in me whatsoever.

58
0:03:11.647,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,

59
0:03:15.627,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and he found pleasure in the smallest things,

60
0:03:17.833,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like lining up cars around the room

61
0:03:20.356,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and staring at the washing machine

62
0:03:22.033,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and eating anything that came in between.

63
0:03:25.415,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And as he grew older, he grew more different,

64
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the differences became more obvious.

65
0:03:31.843,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration

66
0:03:35.295,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the never-ending hyperactivity

67
0:03:38.064,000 --> 0:03:4,000
was something really unique:

68
0:03:40.656,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world

69
0:03:44.624,000 --> 0:03:49,000
without prejudice, a human who had never lied.

70
0:03:50.255,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Extraordinary.

71
0:03:53.336,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, I cannot deny that there have been

72
0:03:55.123,000 --> 0:03:57,000
some challenging moments in my family,

73
0:03:57.855,000 --> 0:04:,000
moments where I've wished that they were just like me.

74
0:04:00.968,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me

75
0:04:03.752,000 --> 0:04:06,000
about individuality and communication and love,

76
0:04:07.592,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I realize that these are things that

77
0:04:10.929,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I wouldn't want to change with normality.

78
0:04:15.327,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,

79
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.

80
0:04:23.809,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It just means that there's a different kind of right.

81
0:04:27.647,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi

82
0:04:31.464,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and to Sam

83
0:04:33.79,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and to you,

84
0:04:35.517,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it would be that you don't have to be normal.

85
0:04:39.313,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You can be extraordinary.

86
0:04:43.296,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Because autistic or not,

87
0:04:45.377,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the differences that we have --

88
0:04:47.587,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,

89
0:04:51.955,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality

90
0:04:55.419,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.

91
0:04:58.416,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The chance for greatness, for progress and for change

92
0:05:02.756,000 --> 0:05:05,000
dies the moment we try to be like someone else.

93
0:05:06.635,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.

94
0:05:09.867,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Thank you. (Applause)

95
0:05:12.34,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

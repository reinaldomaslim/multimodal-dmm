(Music)

2
0:00:17.549,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK, you don't have to stand up,

3
0:00:19.995,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but ...

4
0:00:21.738,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we can see you really clearly --

5
0:00:24.046,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.11,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So you have to dance with us.

7
0:00:26.607,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And we have this, like,

8
0:00:29.037,000 --> 0:00:31,000
choreographed dance thing that we're about to do --

9
0:00:31.547,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Betta Lemme: Really easy.

10
0:00:32.782,000 --> 0:00:34,000
SHW: And we're going to flick our wrists like this,

11
0:00:35.623,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and you're going to do it with us.

12
0:00:37.283,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And you can also stand up.

13
0:00:39.278,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Music)

14
0:00:43.999,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

15
0:00:47.854,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

16
0:00:51.782,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It came, it came,

17
0:00:52.972,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it went, it went

18
0:00:54.162,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It conquered quick

19
0:00:55.946,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was there and then I quit

20
0:00:59.549,000 --> 0:01:,000
Awoo!

21
0:01:00.865,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I know I did not raise a wrist

22
0:01:03.562,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I know I did not capture it

23
0:01:07.407,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It came, it came,

24
0:01:08.591,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it went, it went

25
0:01:09.781,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It conquered quick

26
0:01:11.565,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I was there and then I quit

27
0:01:14.924,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Awoo!

28
0:01:16.77,000 --> 0:01:17,000

(Music)

30
0:01:22.309,000 --> 0:01:23,000
SHW: We have another one coming up.

31
0:01:24.043,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's a little finger-pointing dance.

32
0:01:25.801,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Music)

33
0:01:40.86,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The people sitting down,

34
0:01:42.059,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I want to see your fingers pointing.

35
0:01:44.498,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Yeah!

36
0:01:46.406,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

37
0:01:50.369,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

38
0:01:54.252,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It came, it came,

39
0:01:55.443,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it went, it went

40
0:01:56.618,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It conquered quick

41
0:01:58.429,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was there and then I quit

42
0:02:02.435,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Aaaa ...

46
0:02:12.892,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Clapping to the beat)

47
0:02:19.678,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Music)

48
0:02:25.885,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Aaaa ...

49
0:02:31.935,000 --> 0:02:32,000
SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.

50
0:02:33.761,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Both sing) I know I did not raise a wrist

51
0:02:37.187,000 --> 0:02:4,000

I know I did not capture it

58
0:02:56.695,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It came, it came,

59
0:02:57.869,000 --> 0:02:58,000

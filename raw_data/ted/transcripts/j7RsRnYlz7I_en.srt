1
0:00:12.572,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A couple of years ago,

2
0:00:14.023,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Harvard Business School chose

3
0:00:16.241,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the best business model of that year.

4
0:00:18.99,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It chose Somali piracy.

5
0:00:23.054,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Pretty much around the same time,

6
0:00:25.27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I discovered that there were 544 seafarers

7
0:00:31.103,000 --> 0:00:34,000
being held hostage on ships,

8
0:00:34.489,000 --> 0:00:36,000
often anchored just off the Somali coast

9
0:00:36.579,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in plain sight.

10
0:00:39.007,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I learned these two facts, and I thought,

11
0:00:41.632,000 --> 0:00:43,000
what's going on in shipping?

12
0:00:44.073,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I thought, would that happen in any other industry?

13
0:00:46.644,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Would we see 544 airline pilots

14
0:00:50.155,000 --> 0:00:51,000
held captive in their jumbo jets

15
0:00:51.785,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on a runway for months, or a year?

16
0:00:55.272,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?

17
0:00:59.098,000 --> 0:01:,000
It wouldn't happen.

18
0:01:00.977,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I started to get intrigued.

19
0:01:03.755,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I discovered another fact,

20
0:01:06.269,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which to me was more astonishing

21
0:01:08.252,000 --> 0:01:11,000
almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before

22
0:01:11.337,000 --> 0:01:13,000
at the age of 42, 43.

23
0:01:13.996,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping.

24
0:01:19.315,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Because perhaps the general public

25
0:01:21.66,000 --> 0:01:24,000
thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,

26
0:01:24.785,000 --> 0:01:26,000
something brought by sailboat

27
0:01:27.323,000 --> 0:01:3,000
with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.

28
0:01:30.708,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But shipping isn't that.

29
0:01:32.602,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.

30
0:01:37.479,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.

31
0:01:42.082,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.

32
0:01:46.647,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We are more dependent on it now than ever.

33
0:01:49.639,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And yet, for such an enormous industry --

34
0:01:53.398,000 --> 0:01:56,000
there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea —

35
0:01:56.875,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it's become pretty much invisible.

36
0:02:00.268,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,

37
0:02:04.557,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because here shipping is so present

38
0:02:06.903,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.

39
0:02:10.285,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:11.965,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But elsewhere in the world,

41
0:02:13.981,000 --> 0:02:15,000
if you ask the general public what they know

42
0:02:16.227,000 --> 0:02:18,000
about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea,

43
0:02:19.063,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you will get essentially a blank face.

44
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You will ask someone on the street

45
0:02:25.713,000 --> 0:02:26,000
if they've heard of Microsoft.

46
0:02:27.436,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I should think they'll say yes,

47
0:02:29.273,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because they'll know that they make software

48
0:02:31.468,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that goes on computers,

49
0:02:33.363,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and occasionally works.

50
0:02:36.508,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,

51
0:02:40.113,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I doubt you'd get the same response,

52
0:02:42.814,000 --> 0:02:43,000
even though Maersk,

53
0:02:44.261,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which is just one shipping company amongst many,

54
0:02:47.952,000 --> 0:02:49,000
has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.

55
0:02:50.934,000 --> 0:02:51,000
[$60.2 billion]

56
0:02:52.415,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now why is this?

57
0:02:54.338,000 --> 0:02:55,000
A few years ago,

58
0:02:56.251,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the first sea lord of the British admiralty --

59
0:02:59.523,000 --> 0:03:,000
he is called the first sea lord,

60
0:03:01.328,000 --> 0:03:05,000
although the chief of the army is not called a land lord —

61
0:03:05.823,000 --> 0:03:07,000
he said that we, and he meant

62
0:03:08.266,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the industrialized nations in the West,

63
0:03:10.948,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we suffer from sea blindness.

64
0:03:14.76,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We are blind to the sea

65
0:03:16.404,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as a place of industry or of work.

66
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's just something we fly over,

67
0:03:21.623,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a patch of blue on an airline map.

68
0:03:24.628,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Nothing to see, move along.

69
0:03:27.953,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So I wanted to open my own eyes

70
0:03:31.598,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to my own sea blindness,

71
0:03:34.675,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so I ran away to sea.

72
0:03:38.045,000 --> 0:03:4,000
A couple of years ago, I took a passage

73
0:03:40.396,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on the Maersk Kendal,

74
0:03:42.77,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a mid-sized container ship

75
0:03:44.112,000 --> 0:03:47,000
carrying nearly 7,000 boxes,

76
0:03:47.34,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and I departed from Felixstowe,

77
0:03:49.237,000 --> 0:03:5,000
on the south coast of England,

78
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I ended up right here in Singapore

79
0:03:53.161,000 --> 0:03:54,000
five weeks later,

80
0:03:54.654,000 --> 0:03:58,000
considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.

81
0:03:59.558,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And it was a revelation.

82
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We traveled through five seas,

83
0:04:04.995,000 --> 0:04:06,000
two oceans, nine ports,

84
0:04:07.542,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I learned a lot about shipping.

85
0:04:10.289,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And one of the first things that surprised me

86
0:04:12.007,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when I got on board Kendal

87
0:04:14.394,000 --> 0:04:16,000
was, where are all the people?

88
0:04:17.139,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I have friends in the Navy who tell me

89
0:04:18.759,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,

90
0:04:21.898,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.

91
0:04:25.237,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now that's because shipping is very efficient.

92
0:04:28.114,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Containerization has made it very efficient.

93
0:04:31.178,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Ships have automation now.

94
0:04:33.272,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They can operate with small crews.

95
0:04:36.001,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But it also means that, in the words

96
0:04:37.79,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of a port chaplain I once met,

97
0:04:40.25,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the average seafarer you're going to find

98
0:04:42.295,000 --> 0:04:46,000
on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,

99
0:04:46.434,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because the pace of modern shipping

100
0:04:49.213,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is quite punishing for what the shipping calls

101
0:04:51.534,000 --> 0:04:53,000
its human element,

102
0:04:53.965,000 --> 0:04:55,000
a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize

103
0:04:56.417,000 --> 0:04:58,000
sounds a little bit inhuman.

104
0:04:58.821,000 --> 0:05:,000
So most seafarers now working on container ships

105
0:05:01.496,000 --> 0:05:05,000
often have less than two hours in port at a time.

106
0:05:05.573,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They don't have time to relax.

107
0:05:07.211,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They're at sea for months at a time,

108
0:05:09.455,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and even when they're on board,

109
0:05:10.77,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they don't have access to what

110
0:05:12.072,000 --> 0:05:16,000
a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.

111
0:05:16.506,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal

112
0:05:19.335,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was who I was sitting next to --

113
0:05:22.327,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Not the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait --

114
0:05:27.576,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,

115
0:05:30.345,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,

116
0:05:32.173,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.

117
0:05:35.438,000 --> 0:05:37,000
On the next table was a Chinese guy,

118
0:05:37.675,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.

119
0:05:40.717,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So that was a normal working ship.

120
0:05:43.677,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now how is that possible?

121
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Because the biggest dramatic change

122
0:05:47.592,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in shipping over the last 60 years,

123
0:05:49.436,000 --> 0:05:51,000
when most of the general public stopped noticing it,

124
0:05:51.948,000 --> 0:05:53,000
was something called an open registry,

125
0:05:54.567,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or a flag of convenience.

126
0:05:57.372,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation

127
0:05:59.959,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that provides a flag registry.

128
0:06:02.911,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation

129
0:06:05.186,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of Bolivia, or Mongolia,

130
0:06:07.31,000 --> 0:06:09,000
or North Korea, though that's not very popular.

131
0:06:10.285,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:11.708,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So we have these very multinational,

133
0:06:13.819,000 --> 0:06:17,000
global, mobile crews on ships.

134
0:06:18.6,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And that was a surprise to me.

135
0:06:21.312,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And when we got to pirate waters,

136
0:06:24.429,000 --> 0:06:27,000
down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean,

137
0:06:27.555,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the ship changed.

138
0:06:29.307,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And that was also shocking, because suddenly,

139
0:06:32.45,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I realized, as the captain said to me,

140
0:06:34.664,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that I had been crazy to choose to go

141
0:06:36.666,000 --> 0:06:39,000
through pirate waters on a container ship.

142
0:06:39.718,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We were no longer allowed on deck.

143
0:06:41.709,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There were double pirate watches.

144
0:06:44.305,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And at that time, there were those 544 seafarers being held hostage,

145
0:06:48.582,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and some of them were held hostage for years

146
0:06:50.55,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience.

147
0:06:53.321,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Not all of them, but some of them were,

148
0:06:55.403,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners,

149
0:07:00.117,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it can be easy to hide behind

150
0:07:02.662,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.

151
0:07:07.661,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What else does our sea blindness mask?

152
0:07:11.6,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship

153
0:07:13.919,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,

154
0:07:15.914,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you'll see very black smoke.

155
0:07:18.783,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And that's because shipping

156
0:07:21.318,000 --> 0:07:23,000
has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel,

157
0:07:23.905,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so they use something called bunker fuel,

158
0:07:26.076,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry

159
0:07:28.592,000 --> 0:07:3,000
as the dregs of the refinery,

160
0:07:30.758,000 --> 0:07:33,000
or just one step up from asphalt.

161
0:07:34.015,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And shipping is the greenest method of transport.

162
0:07:37.412,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,

163
0:07:39.755,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it emits about a thousandth of aviation

164
0:07:42.726,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and about a tenth of trucking.

165
0:07:44.841,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But it's not benign, because there's so much of it.

166
0:07:48.077,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So shipping emissions are about three to four percent,

167
0:07:50.607,000 --> 0:07:52,000
almost the same as aviation's.

168
0:07:52.782,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And if you put shipping emissions

169
0:07:54.171,000 --> 0:07:57,000
on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,

170
0:07:57.551,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it would come in about sixth,

171
0:07:59.164,000 --> 0:08:01,000
somewhere near Germany.

172
0:08:01.278,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships

173
0:08:05.296,000 --> 0:08:07,000
pollute in terms of particles and soot

174
0:08:07.891,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and noxious gases

175
0:08:09.291,000 --> 0:08:11,000
as much as all the cars in the world.

176
0:08:11.869,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And the good news is that

177
0:08:13.269,000 --> 0:08:15,000
people are now talking about sustainable shipping.

178
0:08:15.464,000 --> 0:08:17,000
There are interesting initiatives going on.

179
0:08:17.951,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But why has it taken so long?

180
0:08:20.206,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When are we going to start talking and thinking

181
0:08:22.553,000 --> 0:08:26,000
about shipping miles as well as air miles?

182
0:08:26.589,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I also traveled to Cape Cod to look

183
0:08:29.394,000 --> 0:08:32,000
at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,

184
0:08:33.321,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because this to me was one of the most surprising things

185
0:08:35.477,000 --> 0:08:36,000
about my time at sea,

186
0:08:37.433,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and what it made me think about.

187
0:08:39.23,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We know about man's impact on the ocean

188
0:08:42.383,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in terms of fishing and overfishing,

189
0:08:44.815,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but we don't really know much about

190
0:08:46.623,000 --> 0:08:48,000
what's happening underneath the water.

191
0:08:48.806,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,

192
0:08:51.411,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because shipping noise has contributed

193
0:08:55.057,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures.

194
0:08:58.25,000 --> 0:09:,000
Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water,

195
0:09:01.242,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins

196
0:09:03.869,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and even 800 species of fish

197
0:09:06.173,000 --> 0:09:08,000
communicate by sound.

198
0:09:09.064,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And a North Atlantic right whale

199
0:09:10.777,000 --> 0:09:13,000
can transmit across hundreds of miles.

200
0:09:13.984,000 --> 0:09:14,000
A humpback can transmit a sound

201
0:09:15.947,000 --> 0:09:16,000
across a whole ocean.

202
0:09:17.885,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But a supertanker can also be heard

203
0:09:19.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
coming across a whole ocean,

204
0:09:21.911,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and because the noise that propellers make underwater

205
0:09:24.475,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,

206
0:09:27.812,000 --> 0:09:3,000
then it can damage their acoustic habitat,

207
0:09:30.846,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and they need this for breeding,

208
0:09:32.536,000 --> 0:09:33,000
for finding feeding grounds,

209
0:09:34.187,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for finding mates.

210
0:09:36.71,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale

211
0:09:39.551,000 --> 0:09:42,000
has been reduced by up to 90 percent.

212
0:09:42.901,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet.

213
0:09:47.513,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And when I arrived in Singapore,

214
0:09:50.769,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and I apologize for this, but I didn't want to get off my ship.

215
0:09:55.676,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I'd really loved being on board Kendal.

216
0:09:58.635,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I'd been well treated by the crew,

217
0:10:00.53,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,

218
0:10:04.071,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks,

219
0:10:08.143,000 --> 0:10:09,000
something that the captain also said

220
0:10:09.974,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I was crazy to think about.

221
0:10:12.247,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But I wasn't there for nine months at a time

222
0:10:14.491,000 --> 0:10:15,000
like the Filipino seafarers,

223
0:10:16.446,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who, when I asked them to describe their job to me,

224
0:10:18.685,000 --> 0:10:2,000
called it "dollar for homesickness."

225
0:10:21.007,000 --> 0:10:22,000
They had good salaries,

226
0:10:22.485,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life

227
0:10:25.516,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in a dangerous and often difficult element.

228
0:10:29.205,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,

229
0:10:31.291,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because I want to salute those seafarers

230
0:10:34.216,000 --> 0:10:36,000
who bring us 90 percent of everything

231
0:10:36.403,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and get very little thanks or recognition for it.

232
0:10:40.069,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I want to salute the 100,000 ships

233
0:10:42.79,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that are at sea

234
0:10:44.113,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that are doing that work, coming in and out

235
0:10:46.646,000 --> 0:10:49,000
every day, bringing us what we need.

236
0:10:49.875,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But I also want to see shipping,

237
0:10:52.895,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and us, the general public, who know so little about it,

238
0:10:56.374,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to have a bit more scrutiny,

239
0:10:58.414,000 --> 0:11:,000
to be a bit more transparent,

240
0:11:00.518,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to have 90 percent transparency.

241
0:11:03.79,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Because I think we could all benefit

242
0:11:06.691,000 --> 0:11:08,000
from doing something very simple,

243
0:11:08.796,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which is learning to see the sea.

244
0:11:11.878,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Thank you.

245
0:11:14.036,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

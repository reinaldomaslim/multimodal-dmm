1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'd like to start with a short story.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's about a little boy

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
whose father was a history buff

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and who used to take him by the hand

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
on the outskirts of their camp.

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They would always stop by to visit

8
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
these huge winged bulls that used to guard

9
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the gates of that ancient metropolis,

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and the boy used to be scared

11
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of these winged bulls,

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but at the same time they excited him.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And the dad used to use those bulls

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to tell the boy stories about

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that civilization and their work.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Let's fast-forward to the

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where I started a technology company

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that brought the world its first

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
3D laser scanning system.

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Let me show you how it works.

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Female Voice: Long range laser scanning

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The system measures the beam's time of flight,

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
recording the time it takes for the light

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to hit a surface and make its return.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The point is then recorded

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
into a 3D visualization program.

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
All of this happens in seconds.

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Ben Kacyra: You can see here,

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
these systems are extremely fast.

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They collect millions of points at a time

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with very high accuracy

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and very high resolution.

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
A surveyor with traditional survey tools

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
would be hard-pressed to produce

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
maybe 500 points in a whole day.

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
These babies would be producing

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
something like ten thousand points a second.

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So, as you can imagine,

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
this was a paradigm shift

45
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in the survey and construction

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
as well as in reality capture industry.

47
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Approximately ten years ago,

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
my wife and I started a foundation to do good,

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and right about that time,

50
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,

51
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,

52
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
were blown up by the Taliban.

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They were gone in an instant.

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And unfortunately, there was

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.

56
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This clearly devastated me,

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I couldn't help but wonder about

58
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the fate of the many, many

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
heritage sites all over the world.

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Both my wife and I

62
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
were so touched by this

63
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that we decided to

64
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
expand the mission of our foundation

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to include digital heritage preservation

66
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of world sites.

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We called the project CyArk,

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which stands for Cyber Archive.

69
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
To date, with the help of

70
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a global network of partners,

71
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we've completed close to fifty projects.

72
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Let me show you some of them:

73
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Chichen Itza,

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Rapa Nui --

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and what you're seeing here

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are the cloud of points --

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Babylon,

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Rosslyn Chapel,

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Pompeii,

80
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which happened to be one of

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
our most challenging projects.

83
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
As you see here, we had to develop

84
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a special rig to bring the scanner

85
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
up close and personal.

86
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The results of our work in the field

87
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
are used to produce

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
media and deliverables to be used

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by conservators and researchers.

90
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We also produce media for

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
dissemination to the public --

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
free through the CyArk website.

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
These would be used for education,

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
cultural tourism, etc.

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
What you're looking at in here

96
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is a 3D viewer that we developed

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that would allow the display

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and manipulation of [the] cloud of points

99
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in real time, cutting sections through them

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and extracting dimensions.

101
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This happens to be the cloud of points

102
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for Tikal.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In here you see a traditional 2D

104
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
architectural engineering drawing

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that's used for preservation, and of course

106
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we tell the stories through fly-throughs.

107
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And here, this is a fly-through

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the cloud of points of Tikal,

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and here you see it rendered

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and photo-textured with the photography

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that we take of the site.

112
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And so this is not a video.

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This is actual 3D points with

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
two to three millimeter accuracy.

115
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And of course the data can be used

116
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to develop 3D models that are

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
very accurate and very detailed.

118
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And here you're looking at a model

119
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that's extracted from the cloud of points

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for Stirling Castle.

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's used for studies, for visualization,

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as well as for education.

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And finally, we produce mobile apps

124
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that include narrated virtual tools.

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The more I got involved

126
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in the heritage field,

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the more it became clear to me

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that we are losing the sites

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and the stories faster than we can

130
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
physically preserve them.

131
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Of course, earthquakes

132
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and all the natural phenomena --

133
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
floods, tornadoes, etc. --

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
take their toll.

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
However, what occurred to me was

136
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
human-caused destruction, which was

137
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
not only causing a significant portion

138
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the destruction, but actually

139
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it was accelerating.

140
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This includes arson,

141
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
urban sprawl,

142
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
acid rain, not to mention

143
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
terrorism and wars.

144
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It was getting more and more apparent

145
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that we're fighting a losing battle.

146
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We're losing our sites

147
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the stories,

148
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and basically we're losing

149
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
a piece -- and a significant piece --

150
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of our collective memory.

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Imagine us as a human race

152
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
not knowing where we came from.

153
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Luckily, in the last two or three decades,

154
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
digital technologies have been developing

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that have helped us to develop tools

156
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that we've brought to bear

157
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in the digital preservation,

158
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in our digital preservation war.

159
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This includes, for example,

160
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the 3D laser scanning systems,

161
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
ever more powerful personal computers,

162
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
3D graphics,

163
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
high-definition digital photography,

164
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
not to mention the Internet.

165
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Because of this accelerated

166
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
pace of destruction,

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it became clear to us that we needed

168
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to challenge ourselves and our partners

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to accelerate our work.

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And we created a project

171
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --

172
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and that is to digitally preserve

173
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
500 World Heritage Sites

174
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in five years.

175
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We do have the technology

176
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that's scaleable,

177
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and our network of global partners

178
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
has been expanding and can be expanded

179
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
at a rapid rate,

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
so we're comfortable

181
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that this task can be accomplished.

182
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
However, to me, the 500 is

183
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
really just the first 500.

184
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In order to sustain our work into the future,

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we use technology centers

186
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where we partner with

187
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
local universities and colleges

188
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to take the technology to them,

189
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
whereby they then can help us

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
with digital preservation of their heritage sites,

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and at the same time, it gives them

192
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the technology to benefit from in the future.

193
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Let me close with another short story.

194
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Two years ago, we were approached

195
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
by a partner of ours to digitally preserve

196
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
an important heritage site,

197
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,

198
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the Royal Kasubi Tombs.

199
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The work was done successfully in the field,

200
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the data was archived

201
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and publicly disseminated

202
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
through the CyArk website.

203
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Last March,

204
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we received very sad news.

205
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed

206
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
by suspected arson.

207
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
A few days later, we received a call:

208
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"Is the data available

209
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and can it be used for reconstruction?"

210
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Our answer, of course, was yes.

211
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Let me leave you with a final thought.

212
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Our heritage is much more than

213
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
our collective memory --

214
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it's our collective treasure.

215
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We owe it to our children,

216
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
our grandchildren and the generations

217
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we will never meet

218
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to keep it safe

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and to pass it along.

220
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Thank you.

221
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

222
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Thank you.

223
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Thank you.

224
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Thank you.

225
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, I'm staying here because

226
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we wanted to demonstrate to you

227
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the power of this technology

228
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and so, while I've been speaking,

229
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
you have been scanned.

230
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The two wizards that I have

232
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that are behind the curtain

233
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
will help me bring

234
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the results on the screen.

235
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

236
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This is all in 3D and of course

237
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you can fly through the cloud of points.

238
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
You can look at it from on top,

239
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
from the ceiling.

240
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You can look from different vantage points,

241
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in

242
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
on an individual in the crowd,

243
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
just to show the amount of detail

244
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we can create.

245
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So you have been digitally preserved

246
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in about four minutes.

247
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

248
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I'd like to thank the wizards here.

249
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We were very lucky to have

250
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
two of our partners participate in this:

251
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the Historic Scotland,

252
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and the Glasgow School of Art.

253
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'd like to also thank personally

254
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the efforts of David Mitchell,

255
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who is the Director of Conservation

256
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
at Historic Scotland.

257
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
David.

258
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

259
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of

260
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.

261
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Let's give them a hand.

262
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

263
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Thank you.

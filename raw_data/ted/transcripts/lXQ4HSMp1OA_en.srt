1
0:00:12.921,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Do you ever find yourself referencing a study in conversation

2
0:00:17.175,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that you didn't actually read?

3
0:00:20.571,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was having coffee with a friend of mine the other day,

5
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I said, "You know, I read a new study

6
0:00:28.009,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that says coffee reduces the risk of depression in women."

7
0:00:32.175,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But really, what I read was a tweet.

8
0:00:37.476,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:39.128,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That said --

10
0:00:40.331,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.522,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"A new study says drinking coffee may decrease depression risk in women."

12
0:00:45.702,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.212,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that tweet had a link to the "New York Times" blog,

14
0:00:51.696,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where a guest blogger translated the study findings

15
0:00:54.427,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from a "Live Science" article,

16
0:00:56.633,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which got its original information

17
0:00:58.593,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from the Harvard School of Public Health news site,

18
0:01:02.061,000 --> 0:01:05,000
which cited the actual study abstract,

19
0:01:05.379,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which summarized the actual study published in an academic journal.

20
0:01:09.788,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:11.577,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's like the six degrees of separation,

22
0:01:14.196,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but with research.

23
0:01:15.53,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:16.703,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So, when I said I read a study,

25
0:01:20.03,000 --> 0:01:26,000
what I actually read was 59 characters that summarized 10 years of research.

26
0:01:26.222,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.179,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So, when I said I read a study,

28
0:01:30.966,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was reading fractions of the study

29
0:01:34.078,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that were put together by four different writers

30
0:01:36.823,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that were not the author,

31
0:01:38.744,000 --> 0:01:39,000
before it got to me.

32
0:01:40.823,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That doesn't seem right.

33
0:01:42.886,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But accessing original research is difficult,

34
0:01:46.069,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because academics aren't regularly engaging with popular media.

35
0:01:50.982,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And you might be asking yourself,

36
0:01:52.752,000 --> 0:01:54,000
why aren't academics engaging with popular media?

37
0:01:55.585,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It seems like they'd be a more legitimate source of information

38
0:01:58.577,000 --> 0:01:59,000
than the media pundits.

39
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Right?

40
0:02:01.934,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:03.109,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In a country with over 4,100 colleges and universities,

42
0:02:06.704,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it feels like this should be the norm.

43
0:02:09.513,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But it's not.

44
0:02:11.087,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, how did we get here?

45
0:02:14.505,000 --> 0:02:17,000
To understand why scholars aren't engaging with popular media,

46
0:02:17.927,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you first have to understand how universities work.

47
0:02:21.497,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, in the last six years,

48
0:02:22.838,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I've taught at seven different colleges and universities

49
0:02:25.482,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in four different states.

50
0:02:27.473,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm a bit of an adjunct extraordinaire.

51
0:02:29.379,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:30.441,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD.

53
0:02:33.458,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In all of these different institutions,

54
0:02:35.831,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the research and publication process works the same way.

55
0:02:39.232,000 --> 0:02:42,000
First, scholars produce research in their fields.

56
0:02:42.557,000 --> 0:02:46,000
To fund their research, they apply for public and private grants

57
0:02:46.732,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and after the research is finished,

58
0:02:48.434,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they write a paper about their findings.

59
0:02:50.879,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Then they submit that paper to relevant academic journals.

60
0:02:54.807,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Then it goes through a process called peer review,

61
0:02:57.204,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which essentially means that other experts

62
0:02:59.228,000 --> 0:03:01,000
are checking it for accuracy and credibility.

63
0:03:02.553,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then, once it's published,

64
0:03:04.91,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for-profit companies resell that information

65
0:03:08.03,000 --> 0:03:09,000
back to universities and public libraries

66
0:03:10.022,000 --> 0:03:12,000
through journal and database subscriptions.

67
0:03:13.038,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So, that's the system.

68
0:03:16.188,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Research, write, peer-review, publish, repeat.

69
0:03:21.315,000 --> 0:03:24,000
My friends and I call it feeding the monster.

70
0:03:25.657,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And you can see how this might create some problems.

71
0:03:29.728,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The first problem is that most academic research is publicly funded

72
0:03:34.403,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but privately distributed.

73
0:03:37.268,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Every year, the federal government spends 60 billion dollars on research.

74
0:03:42.498,000 --> 0:03:44,000
According to the National Science Foundation,

75
0:03:44.641,000 --> 0:03:47,000
29 percent of that goes to public research universities.

76
0:03:47.807,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So, if you're quick at math, that's 17.4 billion dollars.

77
0:03:53.707,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Tax dollars.

78
0:03:55.667,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And just five corporations are responsible

79
0:03:58.025,000 --> 0:04:,000
for distributing most publicly funded research.

80
0:04:00.643,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In 2014, just one of those companies made 1.5 billion dollars in profit.

81
0:04:07.505,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's a big business.

82
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I bet you can see the irony here.

83
0:04:12.37,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If the public is funding academics' research,

84
0:04:15.427,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but then we have to pay again to access the results,

85
0:04:19.871,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's like we're paying for it twice.

86
0:04:22.855,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And the other major problem

87
0:04:24.188,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is that most academics don't have a whole lot of incentive

88
0:04:26.935,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to publish outside of these prestigious subscription-based journals.

89
0:04:30.988,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Universities build their tenure and promotion systems

90
0:04:33.593,000 --> 0:04:35,000
around the number of times scholars publish.

91
0:04:36.338,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, books and journal articles are kind of like a form of currency for scholars.

92
0:04:40.617,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Publishing articles helps you get tenure and more research grants down the road.

93
0:04:45.347,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But academics are not rewarded for publishing with popular media.

94
0:04:50.78,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So, this is the status quo.

95
0:04:54.002,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The current academic ecosystem.

96
0:04:56.82,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But I don't think it has to be this way.

97
0:04:59.776,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We can make some simple changes to flip the script.

98
0:05:04.403,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, first, let's start by discussing access.

99
0:05:08.069,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Universities can begin to challenge the status quo

100
0:05:12.061,000 --> 0:05:14,000
by rewarding scholars for publishing

101
0:05:14.126,000 --> 0:05:16,000
not just in these subscription-based journals

102
0:05:16.919,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but in open-access journals as well as on popular media.

103
0:05:21.673,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, the open-access movement is starting to make some progress

104
0:05:24.657,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in many disciplines,

105
0:05:26.006,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and fortunately, some other big players have started to notice.

106
0:05:30.252,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Google Scholar has made open-access research

107
0:05:33.958,000 --> 0:05:35,000
searchable and easier to find.

108
0:05:37.077,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Congress, last year, introduced a bill

109
0:05:40.315,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that suggests that academic research projects

110
0:05:43.778,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with over 100 million or more in funding

111
0:05:46.855,000 --> 0:05:47,000
should develop an open-access policy.

112
0:05:49.488,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And this year, NASA opened up its entire research library to the public.

113
0:05:55.353,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So, you can see this idea is beginning to catch on.

114
0:05:59.585,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But access isn't just about being able

115
0:06:02.03,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to get your hands on a document or a study.

116
0:06:05.165,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's also about making sure

117
0:06:06.823,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that that document or study is easily understood.

118
0:06:09.83,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So, let's talk about translation.

119
0:06:15.497,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I don't envision this translation to look like the six degrees of separation

120
0:06:20.871,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that I illustrated earlier.

121
0:06:23.847,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Instead, what if scholars were able to take the research that they're doing

122
0:06:27.959,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and translate it on popular media

123
0:06:29.824,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and be able to engage with the public?

124
0:06:33.672,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If scholars did this,

125
0:06:35.061,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the degrees of separation between the public and research

126
0:06:38.339,000 --> 0:06:39,000
would shrink by a lot.

127
0:06:40.276,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So, you see, I'm not suggesting a dumbing-down of the research.

128
0:06:44.236,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I'm just suggesting that we give the public access to that research

129
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and that we shift the venue and focus on using plain language

130
0:06:51.427,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so that the public who's paying for the research

131
0:06:54.141,000 --> 0:06:55,000
can also consume it.

132
0:06:57.395,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And there are some other benefits to this approach.

133
0:07:01.427,000 --> 0:07:03,000
By showing the public how their tax dollars

134
0:07:04.314,000 --> 0:07:06,000
are being used to fund research,

135
0:07:06.482,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they can begin to redefine universities' identities

136
0:07:09.76,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so that universities' identities are not just based on a football team

137
0:07:13.744,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or the degrees they grant

138
0:07:15.863,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but on the research that's being produced there.

139
0:07:19.157,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And when there's a healthy relationship between the public and scholars,

140
0:07:24.165,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it encourages public participation in research.

141
0:07:28.673,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Can you imagine what that might look like?

142
0:07:32.188,000 --> 0:07:33,000
What if social scientists

143
0:07:33.847,000 --> 0:07:36,000
helped local police redesign their sensitivity trainings

144
0:07:37.498,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and then collaboratively wrote a manual to model future trainings?

145
0:07:42.924,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Or what if our education professors consulted with our local public schools

146
0:07:48.711,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to decide how we're going to intervene with our at-risk students

147
0:07:51.831,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then wrote about it in a local newspaper?

148
0:07:55.411,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Because a functioning democracy

149
0:07:58.673,000 --> 0:08:01,000
requires that the public be well-educated and well-informed.

150
0:08:03.03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Instead of research happening behind paywalls and bureaucracy,

151
0:08:07.363,000 --> 0:08:1,000
wouldn't it be better if it was unfolding right in front of us?

152
0:08:12.419,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, as a PhD student,

153
0:08:15.133,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I realize I'm critiquing the club I want to join.

154
0:08:18.39,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:19.673,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Which is a dangerous thing to do,

156
0:08:21.3,000 --> 0:08:24,000
since I'm going to be on the academic job market in a couple of years.

157
0:08:25.347,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But if the status quo in academic research

158
0:08:28.833,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is to publish in the echo chambers of for-profit journals

159
0:08:31.681,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that never reach the public,

160
0:08:34.077,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you better believe my answer is going to be "nope."

161
0:08:38.085,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I believe in inclusive, democratic research

162
0:08:41.538,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that works in the community and talks with the public.

163
0:08:45.727,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I want to work in research and in an academic culture

164
0:08:48.269,000 --> 0:08:51,000
where the public is not only seen as a valuable audience,

165
0:08:51.927,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but a constituent, a participant.

166
0:08:55.066,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And in some cases even the expert.

167
0:09:00.852,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And this isn't just about

168
0:09:04.53,000 --> 0:09:07,000
giving you guys access to information.

169
0:09:08.768,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's about shifting academic culture from publishing to practice

170
0:09:13.831,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and from talking to doing.

171
0:09:17.458,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And you should know that this idea, this hope --

172
0:09:21.212,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it doesn't just belong to me.

173
0:09:23.743,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm standing on the shoulders of many scholars, teachers,

174
0:09:27.696,000 --> 0:09:29,000
librarians and community members

175
0:09:30.696,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who also advocate for including more people in the conversation.

176
0:09:34.912,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I hope you join our conversation, too.

177
0:09:37.54,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Thank you.

178
0:09:38.73,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Applause)

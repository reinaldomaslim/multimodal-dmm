1
0:00:12.557,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In the space that used to house one transistor,

2
0:00:16.259,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we can now fit one billion.

3
0:00:19.636,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That made it so that a computer the size of an entire room

4
0:00:23.557,000 --> 0:00:25,000
now fits in your pocket.

5
0:00:26.17,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You might say the future is small.

6
0:00:29.611,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As an engineer,

7
0:00:30.842,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers.

8
0:00:34.851,000 --> 0:00:35,000
As a physician,

9
0:00:36.223,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost

10
0:00:41.97,000 --> 0:00:45,000
due to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth:

11
0:00:46.101,000 --> 0:00:47,000
cancer.

12
0:00:47.543,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now when I say that,

13
0:00:48.822,000 --> 0:00:51,000
what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer.

14
0:00:52.624,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we are.

15
0:00:53.911,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But it turns out

16
0:00:55.086,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that there's an incredible opportunity to save lives

17
0:00:57.911,000 --> 0:01:,000
through the early detection and prevention of cancer.

18
0:01:01.785,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable

19
0:01:07.188,000 --> 0:01:09,000
using methods that we already have in hand today.

20
0:01:10.406,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Things like vaccination, timely screening

21
0:01:13.329,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and of course, stopping smoking.

22
0:01:16.316,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But even with the best tools and technologies that we have today,

23
0:01:19.933,000 --> 0:01:21,000
some tumors can't be detected

24
0:01:22.02,000 --> 0:01:25,000
until 10 years after they've started growing,

25
0:01:25.714,000 --> 0:01:28,000
when they are 50 million cancer cells strong.

26
0:01:30.178,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What if we had better technologies

27
0:01:31.881,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner,

28
0:01:35.011,000 --> 0:01:36,000
when they could be removed,

29
0:01:36.337,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when they were just getting started?

30
0:01:38.562,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there.

31
0:01:43.14,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This is a microscope in a typical lab

32
0:01:45.452,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen,

33
0:01:49.032,000 --> 0:01:51,000
like a biopsy or a pap smear.

34
0:01:51.927,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This $7,000 microscope

35
0:01:54.019,000 --> 0:01:57,000
would be used by somebody with years of specialized training

36
0:01:57.299,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to spot cancer cells.

37
0:02:00.126,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University,

38
0:02:03.196,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Rebecca Richards-Kortum.

39
0:02:04.798,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope

40
0:02:08.649,000 --> 0:02:09,000
into this $10 part,

41
0:02:10.648,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and it fits on the end of an optical fiber.

42
0:02:13.923,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient

43
0:02:17.581,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and sending it to the microscope,

44
0:02:19.254,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you can bring the microscope to the patient.

45
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images,

46
0:02:26.643,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.

47
0:02:32.084,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now this is important,

48
0:02:33.278,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because what they found working in rural communities,

49
0:02:36.339,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is that even when they have a mobile screening van

50
0:02:39.602,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that can go out into the community and perform exams

51
0:02:42.459,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and collect samples

52
0:02:43.888,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and send them to the central hospital for analysis,

53
0:02:47.128,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that days later,

54
0:02:48.496,000 --> 0:02:5,000
women get a call with an abnormal test result

55
0:02:51.187,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they're asked to come in.

56
0:02:52.828,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Fully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip.

57
0:02:57.721,000 --> 0:03:,000
With the integrated microscope and computer analysis,

58
0:03:01.169,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van

59
0:03:04.021,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup.

60
0:03:07.831,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And what that means is that they can do a diagnosis

61
0:03:10.569,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and perform therapy on the spot,

62
0:03:13.28,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so no one is lost to follow up.

63
0:03:15.831,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives.

64
0:03:20.148,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now as engineers,

65
0:03:21.325,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we think of this as straight-up miniaturization.

66
0:03:24.094,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You took a big thing and you made it little.

67
0:03:26.555,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But what I told you before about computers

68
0:03:28.83,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was that they transformed our lives

69
0:03:31.1,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere.

70
0:03:35.785,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine?

71
0:03:40.5,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, what if you had a detector

72
0:03:43.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that was so small that it could circulate in your body,

73
0:03:47.946,000 --> 0:03:49,000
find the tumor all by itself

74
0:03:50.383,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and send a signal to the outside world?

75
0:03:53.079,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It sounds a little bit like science fiction.

76
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that.

77
0:03:59.415,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector

78
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from the width of a human hair,

79
0:04:06.181,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which is 100 microns,

80
0:04:07.865,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to a thousand times smaller,

81
0:04:10.444,000 --> 0:04:11,000
which is 100 nanometers.

82
0:04:12.37,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that has profound implications.

83
0:04:15.583,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It turns out that materials actually change their properties

84
0:04:19.25,000 --> 0:04:2,000
at the nanoscale.

85
0:04:21.279,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You take a common material like gold,

86
0:04:23.801,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles,

87
0:04:27.146,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it changes from looking gold to looking red.

88
0:04:31.082,000 --> 0:04:34,000
If you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide --

89
0:04:34.919,000 --> 0:04:36,000
forms a big, black crystal --

90
0:04:37.117,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if you make nanocrystals out of this material

91
0:04:39.742,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and you put it in a liquid,

92
0:04:41.339,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and you shine light on it,

93
0:04:43.187,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they glow.

94
0:04:44.377,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red,

95
0:04:50.032,000 --> 0:04:52,000
depending only on their size.

96
0:04:52.887,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world?

97
0:04:56.914,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton,

98
0:05:03.509,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but they are different colors depending only on their size.

99
0:05:08.212,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:10.982,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So as a physician,

101
0:05:12.53,000 --> 0:05:14,000
what's just as interesting to me

102
0:05:14.778,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is that it's not just the color of materials

103
0:05:17.102,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that changes at the nanoscale;

104
0:05:19.057,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the way they travel in your body also changes.

105
0:05:23.137,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And this is the kind of observation that we're going to use

106
0:05:25.96,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to make a better cancer detector.

107
0:05:28.158,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So let me show you what I mean.

108
0:05:30.686,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This is a blood vessel in the body.

109
0:05:32.907,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.

110
0:05:35.683,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel

111
0:05:38.748,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor.

112
0:05:43.464,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky,

113
0:05:47.84,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor.

114
0:05:52.628,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Whether they leak out depends on their size.

115
0:05:56.129,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So in this image,

116
0:05:57.303,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out,

117
0:06:01.698,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles

118
0:06:05.118,000 --> 0:06:06,000
are stuck in the bloodstream.

119
0:06:06.919,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So that means as an engineer,

120
0:06:09.046,000 --> 0:06:12,000
depending on how big or small I make a material,

121
0:06:13.062,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I can change where it goes in your body.

122
0:06:17.249,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector

123
0:06:21.915,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors.

124
0:06:27.477,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We designed it to listen for tumor invasion:

125
0:06:31.593,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread.

126
0:06:36.932,000 --> 0:06:38,000
For a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in,

127
0:06:39.858,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it has to make chemicals called enzymes

128
0:06:42.598,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to chew through the scaffolding of tissues.

129
0:06:45.763,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes.

130
0:06:51.034,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour.

131
0:06:57.462,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio

132
0:07:01.044,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a form of amplification,

133
0:07:02.633,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and it makes something ultrasensitive.

134
0:07:04.829,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.

135
0:07:09.22,000 --> 0:07:13,000
OK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world,

136
0:07:14.144,000 --> 0:07:15,000
where I can act on it?

137
0:07:15.906,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology,

138
0:07:19.482,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and that has to do with the kidney.

139
0:07:21.659,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The kidney is a filter.

140
0:07:23.996,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine.

141
0:07:29.197,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It turns out that what the kidney filters

142
0:07:31.883,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is also dependent on size.

143
0:07:34.901,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So in this image, what you can see

144
0:07:36.865,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is that everything smaller than five nanometers

145
0:07:39.898,000 --> 0:07:43,000
is going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine,

146
0:07:44.027,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and everything else that's bigger is retained.

147
0:07:47.176,000 --> 0:07:51,000
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector,

148
0:07:52.147,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I inject it in the bloodstream,

149
0:07:54.643,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes

150
0:08:00.097,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to release a small signal

151
0:08:02.477,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney

152
0:08:05.723,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and put into the urine,

153
0:08:07.925,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.

154
0:08:12.588,000 --> 0:08:14,000
OK, but there's one more problem.

155
0:08:14.664,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is a tiny little signal,

156
0:08:16.434,000 --> 0:08:17,000
so how do I detect it?

157
0:08:18.73,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, the signal is just a molecule.

158
0:08:20.989,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They're molecules that we designed as engineers.

159
0:08:23.68,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They're completely synthetic, and we can design them

160
0:08:26.882,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so they are compatible with our tool of choice.

161
0:08:30.145,000 --> 0:08:33,000
If we want to use a really sensitive, fancy instrument

162
0:08:33.611,000 --> 0:08:34,000
called a mass spectrometer,

163
0:08:35.599,000 --> 0:08:37,000
then we make a molecule with a unique mass.

164
0:08:38.671,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Or maybe we want make something that's more inexpensive and portable.

165
0:08:42.394,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Then we make molecules that we can trap on paper,

166
0:08:46.201,000 --> 0:08:47,000
like a pregnancy test.

167
0:08:47.929,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In fact, there's a whole world of paper tests

168
0:08:50.579,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics.

169
0:08:55.711,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Alright, where are we going with this?

170
0:08:58.724,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What I'm going to tell you next,

171
0:09:00.317,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as a lifelong researcher,

172
0:09:02.167,000 --> 0:09:03,000
represents a dream of mine.

173
0:09:04.396,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I can't say that's it's a promise;

174
0:09:06.513,000 --> 0:09:07,000
it's a dream.

175
0:09:08.029,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward,

176
0:09:11.64,000 --> 0:09:14,000
even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers.

177
0:09:15.601,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I'm going to tell you what I hope will happen with my technology,

178
0:09:19.124,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that my team and I will put our hearts and souls

179
0:09:23.239,000 --> 0:09:24,000
into making a reality.

180
0:09:25.289,000 --> 0:09:26,000
OK, here goes.

181
0:09:27.011,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I dream that one day,

182
0:09:30.39,000 --> 0:09:33,000
instead of going into an expensive screening facility

183
0:09:33.669,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to get a colonoscopy,

184
0:09:35.198,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or a mammogram,

185
0:09:36.545,000 --> 0:09:37,000
or a pap smear,

186
0:09:38.585,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that you could get a shot,

187
0:09:40.328,000 --> 0:09:41,000
wait an hour,

188
0:09:42.012,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and do a urine test on a paper strip.

189
0:09:45.653,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I imagine that this could even happen

190
0:09:48.484,000 --> 0:09:5,000
without the need for steady electricity,

191
0:09:51.171,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or a medical professional in the room.

192
0:09:53.799,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Maybe they could be far away

193
0:09:55.32,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and connected only by the image on a smartphone.

194
0:09:58.854,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now I know this sounds like a dream,

195
0:10:00.613,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but in the lab we already have this working in mice,

196
0:10:03.756,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where it works better than existing methods

197
0:10:05.859,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for the detection of lung, colon and ovarian cancer.

198
0:10:10.603,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And I hope that what this means

199
0:10:12.861,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is that one day we can detect tumors in patients

200
0:10:18.061,000 --> 0:10:21,000
sooner than 10 years after they've started growing,

201
0:10:21.378,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in all walks of life,

202
0:10:23.387,000 --> 0:10:24,000
all around the globe,

203
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and that this would lead to earlier treatments,

204
0:10:28.019,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that we could save more lives than we can today,

205
0:10:31.641,000 --> 0:10:32,000
with early detection.

206
0:10:33.686,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you.

207
0:10:34.892,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.768,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the ocean,

3
0:00:16.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
what is the common point

4
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:23,000
between oil, plastic and radioactivity?

5
0:00:24.408,000 --> 0:00:29,000
On the top line, this is the BP oil spill:

6
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
billions of barrels of oil gushing

7
0:00:31.648,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

8
0:00:33.017,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The middle line is millions of tons of

9
0:00:35.192,000 --> 0:00:37,000
plastic debris accumulating in our ocean,

10
0:00:37.596,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the third line is radioactive material

11
0:00:40.316,000 --> 0:00:42,000
leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant

12
0:00:42.612,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the Pacific Ocean.

13
0:00:43.95,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, the three big problems have in common

14
0:00:48.533,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that they are man-made problems

15
0:00:51.348,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but they are controlled by natural forces.

16
0:00:53.404,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This should make us feel very, terribly awful

17
0:00:57.812,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as much as it should make us feel hopeful,

18
0:01:00.139,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because if we have the power to create these problems,

19
0:01:02.948,000 --> 0:01:03,000
we may as well have the power

20
0:01:04.628,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to remediate these problems.

21
0:01:06.06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But what about natural forces?

22
0:01:08.004,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Well, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,

23
0:01:10.987,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is how we can use these natural forces

24
0:01:13.292,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to remediate these man-made problems.

25
0:01:18.515,000 --> 0:01:19,000
When the BP oil spill happened,

26
0:01:19.741,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I was working at MIT, and I was in charge

27
0:01:22.506,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.

28
0:01:24.903,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico

29
0:01:28.316,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and meet some fishermen and see

30
0:01:30.653,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the terrible conditions in which they were working.

31
0:01:32.444,000 --> 0:01:35,000
More than 700 of these boats,

32
0:01:35.525,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which are fishermen boats repurposed

33
0:01:37.832,000 --> 0:01:39,000
with oil absorbent in white

34
0:01:40.293,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and oil containment in orange, were used,

35
0:01:42.688,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,

36
0:01:45.947,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the health of the cleaners

37
0:01:47.659,000 --> 0:01:48,000
were very deeply affected.

38
0:01:49.572,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I was working on a very interesting technology

39
0:01:53.566,000 --> 0:01:55,000
at MIT, but it was a very long-term view

40
0:01:55.875,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of how to develop technology,

41
0:01:57.309,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it was going to be a very expensive technology,

42
0:01:59.827,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and also it would be patented.

43
0:02:02.275,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I wanted to develop something that we could

44
0:02:04.907,000 --> 0:02:07,000
develop very fast, that would be cheap,

45
0:02:08.307,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and that would be open-source, so, because

46
0:02:10.747,000 --> 0:02:12,000
oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,

47
0:02:12.915,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and that would be using renewable energy.

48
0:02:15.531,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So I quit my dream job,

49
0:02:17.931,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I moved to New Orleans,

50
0:02:19.547,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.

51
0:02:22.491,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Currently, what they were doing is

52
0:02:24.563,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that they were using these small fishing boats,

53
0:02:26.209,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.

54
0:02:29.369,000 --> 0:02:32,000
If you're using the exact same amount of surface

55
0:02:33.082,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention

56
0:02:35.235,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,

57
0:02:37.568,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you can collect a lot more material.

58
0:02:39.336,000 --> 0:02:41,000
If you're multiplying the rig,

59
0:02:41.457,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so you multiply how many layers of absorbent

60
0:02:44.032,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you're using, you can collect a lot more.

61
0:02:45.934,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent

62
0:02:48.535,000 --> 0:02:51,000
against the winds, the surface currents and the waves.

63
0:02:52.167,000 --> 0:02:53,000
These are enormous forces.

64
0:02:53.631,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique

65
0:02:56.654,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of sailing and tacking of the wind

66
0:02:58.907,000 --> 0:03:,000
to capture or intercept the oil

67
0:03:01.525,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that is drifting down the wind.

68
0:03:02.867,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So this didn't require any invention.

69
0:03:06.364,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We just took a simple sailing boat

70
0:03:08.067,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and we tried to pull something long and heavy,

71
0:03:09.964,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but as we tacked back and forth,

72
0:03:12.276,000 --> 0:03:13,000
what we lost was two things:

73
0:03:13.947,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we were losing pulling power and direction.

74
0:03:17.324,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder

75
0:03:21.156,000 --> 0:03:22,000
from the back of the boat to the front,

76
0:03:22.668,000 --> 0:03:23,000
would we have better control?

77
0:03:24.411,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I built this small sailing robot

78
0:03:26.627,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with the rudder at the front,

79
0:03:27.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,

80
0:03:30.34,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,

81
0:03:33.547,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,

82
0:03:36.459,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I could control four meters of absorbent.

83
0:03:38.811,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,

84
0:03:42.627,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and so you see the robot has

85
0:03:45.091,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a front rudder here.

86
0:03:46.763,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Normally it's at the back.

87
0:03:47.979,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability

88
0:03:51.594,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of this was really amazing,

89
0:03:52.874,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,

90
0:03:54.802,000 --> 0:03:55,000
more maneuverable than a normal boat.

91
0:03:56.474,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Then I started publishing online, and

92
0:03:59.338,000 --> 0:04:01,000
some friends from Korea, they started being

93
0:04:02.25,000 --> 0:04:03,000
interested in this, and we made a boat

94
0:04:03.979,000 --> 0:04:04,000
which has a front rudder and a back rudder,

95
0:04:05.787,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so we started interacting with this,

96
0:04:07.845,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and it was slightly better,

97
0:04:09.964,000 --> 0:04:1,000
although it was very small and a bit off balance,

98
0:04:11.888,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but then we thought,

99
0:04:12.968,000 --> 0:04:13,000
what if we have more than two points of control?

100
0:04:14.856,000 --> 0:04:15,000
What if the entire boat becomes a point of control?

101
0:04:16.848,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What if the entire boat changes shape?

102
0:04:18.968,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So — (Applause)

103
0:04:21.408,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

104
0:04:23.304,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And so that's the beginning of Protei,

105
0:04:25.889,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that's the first boat in history

106
0:04:27.528,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that completely changed the shape of the hull

107
0:04:29.152,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in order to control it,

108
0:04:30.322,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and the properties of sailing that we get

109
0:04:33.208,000 --> 0:04:35,000
are very superior compared to a normal boat.

110
0:04:36.106,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,

111
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.

112
0:04:42.876,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This is low speed, low wind speed,

113
0:04:45.576,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the maneuverability is very increased,

114
0:04:47.649,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and here I'm going to do a small jibe,

115
0:04:49.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and look at the position of the sail.

116
0:04:52.056,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,

117
0:04:55.656,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the position of the front sail and the main sail

118
0:04:57.996,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are different to the wind.

119
0:04:59.173,000 --> 0:05:,000
We're catching wind from both sides.

120
0:05:01.056,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And this is exactly what we're looking [for]

121
0:05:03.315,000 --> 0:05:04,000
if we want to pull something long and heavy.

122
0:05:05.099,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.

123
0:05:07.488,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So, I wanted to know if this was possible

124
0:05:10.328,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to put this at an industrial level,

125
0:05:11.799,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so we made a large boat with a large sail,

126
0:05:14.311,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and with a very light hull, inflatable,

127
0:05:17.007,000 --> 0:05:18,000
very small footprint,

128
0:05:18.512,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so we have a very big size and power ratio.

129
0:05:21.336,000 --> 0:05:24,000
After this, we wanted to see if we could

130
0:05:24.567,000 --> 0:05:26,000
implement this and automate the system,

131
0:05:26.864,000 --> 0:05:27,000
so we used the same system but we added

132
0:05:28.536,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a structure to it so we could activate the machine.

133
0:05:30.906,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So, we used the same bladder-inflated system,

134
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and we took it for testing.

135
0:05:36.104,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So this is happening in the Netherlands.

136
0:05:38.415,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast

137
0:05:40.946,000 --> 0:05:42,000
just to see how it works.

138
0:05:43.517,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it,

139
0:05:46.202,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but quickly we saw that we would need

140
0:05:49.104,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a lot more weight at the bottom,

141
0:05:51.253,000 --> 0:05:52,000
so we had to take it back to the lab,

142
0:05:52.79,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and then we built a skin around it,

143
0:05:54.878,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we put batteries, remote controllers, and then

144
0:05:58.165,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we put it in the water and then we

145
0:05:59.613,000 --> 0:06:02,000
let it go in the water and see how well it would work,

146
0:06:02.774,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,

147
0:06:06.198,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and it worked okay, but we still have a long way.

148
0:06:09.421,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Our small prototype has given us good insight

149
0:06:11.857,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that it's working very well,

150
0:06:13.203,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but we still need to work a lot more on this.

151
0:06:15.888,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution

152
0:06:19.757,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of sailing technology.

153
0:06:21.205,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder

154
0:06:23.132,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to two rudders to multiple rudders

155
0:06:25.143,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to the whole boat changing shape,

156
0:06:26.814,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the more we are moving forward,

157
0:06:28.67,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)

158
0:06:34.717,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But I wanted to show you a fish because --

159
0:06:37.094,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In fact, it's very different from a fish.

160
0:06:40.164,000 --> 0:06:44,000
A fish will move because -- by changing like this,

161
0:06:44.564,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but our boat is propelled by the wind still,

162
0:06:47.663,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the hull controls the trajectory.

163
0:06:50.07,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage

164
0:06:53.724,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one,

165
0:06:56.109,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but it's a good one for making demos.

166
0:06:58.358,000 --> 0:07:,000
So the first thing as I show you in the video is

167
0:07:00.634,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we may be able to control the trajectory

168
0:07:04.621,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of a sailing boat better,

169
0:07:06.085,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or we may be able to never be in irons,

170
0:07:09.146,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so never facing the wind,

171
0:07:10.446,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we always can catch the wind from both sides.

172
0:07:12.561,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But new properties of a sailing boat.

173
0:07:15.121,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So if you're looking at the boat from this side,

174
0:07:19.377,000 --> 0:07:21,000
this might remind you of an airplane profile.

175
0:07:21.585,000 --> 0:07:23,000
An airplane, when you're moving in this direction,

176
0:07:23.998,000 --> 0:07:25,000
starts to lift, and that's how it takes off.

177
0:07:26.263,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, if you're taking the same system,

178
0:07:28.438,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and you're putting vertical, you're bending,

179
0:07:30.806,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and if you're moving this way forward,

180
0:07:32.806,000 --> 0:07:35,000
your instinct will tell you that you might go this way,

181
0:07:35.933,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but if you're moving fast enough,

182
0:07:37.74,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you might create what we call lateral lift,

183
0:07:39.759,000 --> 0:07:41,000
so we could get further or closer to the wind.

184
0:07:42.684,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Other property is this:

185
0:07:45.628,000 --> 0:07:48,000
A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here

186
0:07:48.789,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and a rudder at the back,

187
0:07:50.781,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and these two things are what creates most

188
0:07:53.331,000 --> 0:07:55,000
resistance and turbulence behind the boat,

189
0:07:55.985,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but because this doesn't have either

190
0:07:58.256,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a centerboard or a rudder,

191
0:07:59.792,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we hope that if we keep working on this hull design

192
0:08:02.664,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we can improve and have less resistance.

193
0:08:04.856,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach

194
0:08:07.511,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a certain speed, and they are going on waves,

195
0:08:09.735,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,

196
0:08:12.174,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.

197
0:08:15.471,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But if we're going with the flow,

198
0:08:17.559,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if we pay attention to natural patterns

199
0:08:19.695,000 --> 0:08:2,000
instead of trying to be strong,

200
0:08:21.306,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb

201
0:08:23.705,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,

202
0:08:26.902,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to actually save some energy to move forward.

203
0:08:30.059,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So we may have developed the technology

204
0:08:34.21,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,

205
0:08:36.877,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology

206
0:08:41.094,000 --> 0:08:42,000
if it doesn't reach the right hands?

207
0:08:43.04,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Normal technology or innovation happens like this:

208
0:08:45.986,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Somebody has an interesting idea,

209
0:08:48.416,000 --> 0:08:49,000
some other scientist or engineer,

210
0:08:50.378,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they take it to the next level, they make a theory about it

211
0:08:52.882,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and maybe they patent it,

212
0:08:54.138,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then some industry will make a contract

213
0:08:56.674,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,

214
0:08:59.818,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,

215
0:09:01.914,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.

216
0:09:04.682,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What we really want is that this innovation happens

217
0:09:08.378,000 --> 0:09:1,000
continuously. The inventor and engineers

218
0:09:10.714,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and also the manufacturers and everybody

219
0:09:12.45,000 --> 0:09:14,000
works at the same time, but this would be sterile

220
0:09:14.834,000 --> 0:09:17,000
if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.

221
0:09:18.466,000 --> 0:09:2,000
What you really want is not a sequential,

222
0:09:20.506,000 --> 0:09:21,000
not parallel development.

223
0:09:21.898,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You want to have a network of innovation.

224
0:09:23.507,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You want everybody, like we're doing now,

225
0:09:25.586,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to work at the same time, and that can only happen

226
0:09:28.755,000 --> 0:09:31,000
if these people all together decide to share the information,

227
0:09:32.146,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and that's exactly what open hardware is about.

228
0:09:35.086,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's to replace competition by collaboration.

229
0:09:38.755,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's to transform any new product into a new market.

230
0:09:42.906,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So what is open hardware?

231
0:09:45.347,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Essentially, open hardware is a license.

232
0:09:47.13,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's just an intellectual property setup.

233
0:09:49.202,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It means that everybody is free to use,

234
0:09:52.226,000 --> 0:09:55,000
modify and distribute, and in exchange

235
0:09:55.379,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we only ask for two things:

236
0:09:56.657,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The name is credited -- the name of the project --

237
0:09:58.752,000 --> 0:10:,000
and also the people who make improvement,

238
0:10:01.488,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they share back with the community.

239
0:10:02.816,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So it's a very simple condition.

240
0:10:04.152,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,

241
0:10:08.176,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but quickly after I wanted to publish and share

242
0:10:10.352,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this information, so I made a Kickstarter,

243
0:10:12.096,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which is a crowd-fundraising platform,

244
0:10:14.336,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.

245
0:10:16.768,000 --> 0:10:19,000
With this money, I hired a team of young engineers

246
0:10:20.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from all over the world, and we rented a factory

247
0:10:22.608,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

248
0:10:24.128,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We were peer-learning, we were engineering,

249
0:10:27.289,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we were making things, prototyping,

250
0:10:30.472,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but most importantly we were trying our prototypes

251
0:10:32.697,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in the water as often as possible,

252
0:10:34.392,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.

253
0:10:37.544,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is a proud member of Protei from Korea,

254
0:10:40.056,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and on the right side, this is a multiple-masts

255
0:10:42.516,000 --> 0:10:43,000
design proposed by a team in Mexico.

256
0:10:44.449,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine

257
0:10:47.634,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in New York, and so she decided to prototype

258
0:10:50.229,000 --> 0:10:52,000
this idea that she saw, and she documented

259
0:10:52.759,000 --> 0:10:53,000
every step of the process,

260
0:10:54.188,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and she published it on Instructables,

261
0:10:56.437,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which is a website for sharing inventions.

262
0:10:58.669,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Less than one week after,

263
0:11:00.564,000 --> 0:11:04,000
this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.

264
0:11:04.574,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They made it, but they eventually published

265
0:11:06.904,000 --> 0:11:07,000
a simplified design.

266
0:11:08.028,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They also made it into an Instructable,

267
0:11:09.957,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and in less than one week, they had

268
0:11:11.692,000 --> 0:11:13,000
almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.

269
0:11:14.452,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We're working on also simpler technology,

270
0:11:17.356,000 --> 0:11:18,000
not that complex, with younger people

271
0:11:19.307,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and also older people,

272
0:11:20.876,000 --> 0:11:23,000
like this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)

273
0:11:24.027,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So Protei is now an international network

274
0:11:26.844,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of innovation for selling technology

275
0:11:29.692,000 --> 0:11:3,000
using this shape-shifting hull.

276
0:11:31.484,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And what puts us together is that we have a common,

277
0:11:35.519,000 --> 0:11:37,000
at least, global understanding

278
0:11:38.308,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of what the word "business" is, or what it should be.

279
0:11:41.38,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is how most work today.

280
0:11:43.613,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Business as usual is saying, what's most important

281
0:11:45.987,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is to make lots of profit, and you'll be using

282
0:11:48.226,000 --> 0:11:5,000
technology for that, and people will be your work force,

283
0:11:51.051,000 --> 0:11:52,000
instrumentalized,

284
0:11:52.299,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and environment is usually the last priority.

285
0:11:54.971,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience

286
0:11:58.849,000 --> 0:12:,000
and, say, increase your price tag.

287
0:12:01.08,000 --> 0:12:03,000
What we're trying to do, or what we believe,

288
0:12:03.609,000 --> 0:12:05,000
because this is how we believe the world really works,

289
0:12:06.025,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is that without the environment you have nothing.

290
0:12:08.195,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,

291
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we're a technology company,

292
0:12:12.744,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)

293
0:12:17.929,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

294
0:12:21.534,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If we have the courage to understand or accept

295
0:12:25.615,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that this actually how the world really works,

296
0:12:27.535,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and this is the order of priority that we need to choose,

297
0:12:30.552,000 --> 0:12:32,000
then it makes obvious why we need

298
0:12:32.693,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to choose open hardware for developing environmental

299
0:12:35.032,000 --> 0:12:36,000
technology, because we need to share information.

300
0:12:36.912,000 --> 0:12:38,000
What's next for us?

301
0:12:38.992,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So, this small machine that you've seen,

302
0:12:41.527,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we're hoping to make small toys like

303
0:12:43.671,000 --> 0:12:46,000
one-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade --

304
0:12:47.164,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so replace the remote control parts by Androids,

305
0:12:50.15,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,

306
0:12:53.929,000 --> 0:12:54,000
so you could be controlling this

307
0:12:55.152,000 --> 0:12:56,000
from your mobile phone, your tablet.

308
0:12:56.64,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Then what we want to do is create six-meter versions

309
0:13:00.206,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so we can test the maximum performance of these machines,

310
0:13:02.534,000 --> 0:13:03,000
so we can go at very, very high speed.

311
0:13:04.098,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So imagine yourself.

312
0:13:05.361,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You are laying down in a flexible torpedo,

313
0:13:08.546,000 --> 0:13:09,000
sailing at high speed,

314
0:13:10.04,000 --> 0:13:11,000
controlling the shape of the hull with your legs

315
0:13:11.885,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and controlling the sail with your arms.

316
0:13:14.547,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)

317
0:13:18.872,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And we replace the human being --

318
0:13:21.086,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,

319
0:13:23.23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you don't want a human to be sailing those robots --

320
0:13:25.409,000 --> 0:13:28,000
with batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.

321
0:13:28.744,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This is what our teammates, we dream of at night.

322
0:13:32.678,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,

323
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,

324
0:13:39.307,000 --> 0:13:42,000
or we can have swarms of our machines

325
0:13:42.741,000 --> 0:13:45,000
controlled by multi-player video game engines

326
0:13:45.923,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to control many of these machines,

327
0:13:47.874,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to monitor coral reefs

328
0:13:49.625,000 --> 0:13:51,000
or to monitor fisheries.

329
0:13:51.764,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology

330
0:13:56.254,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to better understand and protect our oceans.

331
0:13:59.785,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

332
0:14:03.497,000 --> 0:14:22,000

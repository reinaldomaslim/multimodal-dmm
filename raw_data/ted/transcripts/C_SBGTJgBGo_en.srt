0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Steve Lopez was walking along

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the streets of downtown Los Angeles

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when he heard beautiful music.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the source was a man,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
an African-American man,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
charming, rugged, homeless,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
playing a violin that only had two strings.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I'm telling a story that many of you know,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because Steve's columns became the basis

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for a book, which was turned into a movie,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the Juilliard-trained double bassist

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
whose promising career was cut short

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and 30 years later he was living homeless

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to understand not only the beautiful bond

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that formed between these two men,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but how music helped shape that bond,

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and came backstage and introduced himself.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment

38
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy

39
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and Thorazine and handcuffs,

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.

41
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But as a result now, he is prone to

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
these schizophrenic episodes,

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the worst of which can manifest themselves as

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
him exploding

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and then disappearing for days,

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
wandering the streets of Skid Row,

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind

48
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
unleashed upon him.

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
he was lost.

53
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And he was talking about

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
invisible demons and smoke,

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And I was afraid,

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
not for myself, but I was afraid

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that I was going to lose him,

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that he was going to sink into one of his states,

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
if I started talking about scales

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and arpeggios and other exciting forms of

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
didactic violin pedagogy.

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, I just started playing.

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And as I played,

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I understood that there was a profound change

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was its catalyst.

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And Nathaniel's manic rage

74
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
was transformed into understanding,

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a quiet curiosity and grace.

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and he started playing, by ear,

78
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
certain snippets of violin concertos

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,

80
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we started talking about music, from Bach

82
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to Beethoven and Brahms,

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Bruckner, all the B's,

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.

85
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And I understood that he not only

86
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,

87
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but he related to this music at a personal level.

88
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He spoke about it with the kind of passion

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and understanding that I share with my colleagues

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

91
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And through playing music and talking about music,

92
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
this man had transformed

93
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
from the paranoid, disturbed man

94
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that had just come from walking the streets

95
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of downtown Los Angeles

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to the charming, erudite,

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.

98
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Music is medicine. Music changes us.

99
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.

100
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Because music allows him to take his thoughts

101
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and delusions and shape them

102
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
through his imagination and his creativity,

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
into reality.

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And that is an escape

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
from his tormented state.

106
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.

107
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This was the very reason why we made music,

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that we take something that exists within all of us

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
at our very fundamental core,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
our emotions,

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and through our artistic lens,

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.

113
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And the reality of that expression

114
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
reaches all of us

115
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and moves us, inspires and unites us.

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And for Nathaniel,

117
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
music brought him back into a fold of friends.

118
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The redemptive power of music brought him back

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
into a family of musicians

120
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that understood him,

121
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that recognized his talents

122
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and respected him.

123
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I will always make music with Nathaniel,

124
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall

125
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or on Skid Row, because he reminds me

126
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
why I became a musician.

127
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Thank you.

128
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Applause)

129
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.

130
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Robert Gupta.

131
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.

133
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, please forgive me.

134
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Music)

136
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Applause)

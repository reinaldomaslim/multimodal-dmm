1
0:00:13.043,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ...

2
0:00:17.505,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to a psychologist.

3
0:00:18.977,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days

5
0:00:23.57,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of listening in on some of your conversations

6
0:00:26.984,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and watching you interact with each other.

7
0:00:29.174,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I think it's fair to say, already,

8
0:00:31.723,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that there are 47 people in this audience,

9
0:00:37.494,000 --> 0:00:38,000
at this moment,

10
0:00:39.414,000 --> 0:00:43,000
displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.

11
0:00:43.571,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:44.942,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I thought you might like to know who you are.

13
0:00:47.968,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:49.415,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But instead of pointing at you,

15
0:00:51.126,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which would be gratuitous and intrusive,

16
0:00:54.865,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories,

17
0:00:57.89,000 --> 0:01:,000
in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.

18
0:01:02.089,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology,

19
0:01:06.349,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which is part of a larger personality science

20
0:01:09.813,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives.

21
0:01:15.337,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And what we try to do,

22
0:01:17.601,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in our own way,

23
0:01:19.188,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is to make sense of how each of us --

24
0:01:22.793,000 --> 0:01:23,000
each of you --

25
0:01:24.467,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is, in certain respects,

26
0:01:26.569,000 --> 0:01:27,000
like all other people,

27
0:01:28.993,000 --> 0:01:29,000
like some other people

28
0:01:31.243,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and like no other person.

29
0:01:34.579,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, already you may be saying of yourself,

30
0:01:37.77,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"I'm not intriguing.

31
0:01:41.597,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."

32
0:01:47.895,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Or you may say of yourself,

33
0:01:50.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"I am intriguing,

34
0:01:53.252,000 --> 0:01:56,000
even if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."

35
0:01:57.227,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:58.441,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness"

37
0:02:04.325,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.

38
0:02:09.172,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So let me explain why this is so.

39
0:02:12.284,000 --> 0:02:16,000
One of the most influential approaches in personality science

40
0:02:16.469,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is known as trait psychology,

41
0:02:18.083,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed,

42
0:02:23.476,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people.

43
0:02:31.379,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They spell out the acronym OCEAN.

44
0:02:34.105,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So, "O" stands for "open to experience,"

45
0:02:37.18,000 --> 0:02:39,000
versus those who are more closed.

46
0:02:39.555,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"

47
0:02:42.754,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life.

48
0:02:46.422,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"E" -- "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people.

49
0:02:51.089,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"A" -- "agreeable individuals,"

50
0:02:53.805,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable.

51
0:02:57.599,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals,"

52
0:03:00.267,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in contrast to those who are more stable.

53
0:03:04.268,000 --> 0:03:07,000
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being,

54
0:03:07.682,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for how our life goes.

55
0:03:10.762,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so we know that, for example,

56
0:03:13.135,000 --> 0:03:17,000
openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success,

57
0:03:18.829,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but the open people achieve that success through being audacious

58
0:03:23.23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and, occasionally, odd.

59
0:03:26.077,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines,

60
0:03:30.466,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to persevering, as well as having some passion.

61
0:03:35.662,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive

62
0:03:39.572,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to working well with people.

63
0:03:42.866,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Extroverts, for example, I find intriguing.

64
0:03:45.878,000 --> 0:03:47,000
With my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact

65
0:03:48.885,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that might be revealing with respect to their personality:

66
0:03:52.356,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults

67
0:03:57.426,000 --> 0:04:,000
to lick the outside of their own elbow.

68
0:04:01.287,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:02.565,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Did you know that?

70
0:04:05.505,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Already, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow.

71
0:04:09.718,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But extroverts amongst you

72
0:04:11.518,000 --> 0:04:13,000
are probably those who have not only tried,

73
0:04:14.153,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but they have successfully licked the elbow

74
0:04:16.667,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of the person sitting next to them.

75
0:04:18.382,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:19.408,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Those are the extroverts.

77
0:04:21.117,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion,

78
0:04:24.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because it's consequential and it's intriguing,

79
0:04:27.543,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it helps us understand what I call our three natures.

80
0:04:31.048,000 --> 0:04:34,000
First, our biogenic nature -- our neurophysiology.

81
0:04:34.743,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Second, our sociogenic or second nature,

82
0:04:38.279,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.

83
0:04:42.744,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And third, what makes you individually you -- idiosyncratic --

84
0:04:50.19,000 --> 0:04:53,000
what I call your "idiogenic" nature.

85
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Let me explain.

86
0:04:56.901,000 --> 0:04:59,000
One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.

87
0:05:00.971,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting:

88
0:05:05.719,000 --> 0:05:09,000
loud noises, parties and social events here at TED --

89
0:05:09.78,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.

90
0:05:13.031,000 --> 0:05:14,000
They all gather together.

91
0:05:14.714,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I've seen you.

92
0:05:16.153,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces

93
0:05:19.5,000 --> 0:05:2,000
up on the second floor,

94
0:05:21.347,000 --> 0:05:24,000
where they are able to reduce stimulation --

95
0:05:25.163,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and may be misconstrued as being antisocial,

96
0:05:29.122,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but you're not necessarily antisocial.

97
0:05:33.31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It may be that you simply realize that you do better

98
0:05:37.436,000 --> 0:05:41,000
when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.

99
0:05:42.998,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.

100
0:05:47.17,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.

101
0:05:52.109,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning

102
0:05:55.312,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"

103
0:05:58.221,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they're not kidding --

104
0:05:59.396,000 --> 0:06:,000
they really do.

105
0:06:01.531,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Introverts do not do as well,

106
0:06:03.361,000 --> 0:06:05,000
particularly if the tasks they're engaged in --

107
0:06:06.913,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and they've had some coffee --

108
0:06:08.482,000 --> 0:06:1,000
if those tasks are speeded,

109
0:06:10.644,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and if they're quantitative,

110
0:06:12.547,000 --> 0:06:16,000
introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.

111
0:06:17.58,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But it's a misconstrual.

112
0:06:19.244,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing:

113
0:06:22.312,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we're not always what seem to be,

114
0:06:24.419,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that takes me to my next point.

115
0:06:28.196,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I should say, before getting to this,

116
0:06:30.776,000 --> 0:06:32,000
something about sexual intercourse,

117
0:06:33.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
although I may not have time.

118
0:06:35.605,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And so, if you would like me to --

119
0:06:38.501,000 --> 0:06:39,000
yes, you would?

120
0:06:39.676,000 --> 0:06:4,000
OK.

121
0:06:40.851,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:41.96,000 --> 0:06:42,000
There are studies done

123
0:06:43.144,000 --> 0:06:48,000
on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act,

124
0:06:49.406,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert.

125
0:06:53.1,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So I ask you:

126
0:06:54.275,000 --> 0:06:56,000
How many times per minute --

127
0:06:57.162,000 --> 0:06:58,000
oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --

128
0:06:59.07,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

129
0:07:02.151,000 --> 0:07:03,000
How many times per month

130
0:07:06.715,000 --> 0:07:09,000
do introverted men engage in the act?

131
0:07:10.486,000 --> 0:07:11,000
3.0.

132
0:07:11.9,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Extroverted men?

133
0:07:13.556,000 --> 0:07:14,000
More or less?

134
0:07:15.616,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Yes, more.

135
0:07:17.607,000 --> 0:07:19,000
5.5 -- almost twice as much.

136
0:07:21.264,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Introverted women: 3.1.

137
0:07:23.856,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Extroverted women?

138
0:07:25.476,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,

139
0:07:28.846,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which I will explain later --

140
0:07:30.607,000 --> 0:07:31,000
they are heroic.

141
0:07:32.973,000 --> 0:07:33,000
7.5.

142
0:07:35.782,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They not only handle all the male extroverts,

143
0:07:38.158,000 --> 0:07:4,000
they pick up a few introverts as well.

144
0:07:40.275,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:42.195,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

146
0:07:48.796,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We communicate differently, extroverts and introverts.

147
0:07:54.576,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Extroverts, when they interact,

148
0:07:56.106,000 --> 0:08:,000
want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness.

149
0:08:00.595,000 --> 0:08:02,000
They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.

150
0:08:04.547,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They like to have a lot of eye contact,

151
0:08:06.77,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or mutual gaze.

152
0:08:09.241,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We found in some research

153
0:08:10.472,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody.

154
0:08:13.873,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So when an extrovert meets a Charles,

155
0:08:16.61,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it rapidly becomes "Charlie," and then "Chuck,"

156
0:08:19.519,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and then "Chuckles Baby."

157
0:08:21.222,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:23.032,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Whereas for introverts,

159
0:08:24.461,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it remains "Charles," until he's given a pass to be more intimate

160
0:08:29.39,000 --> 0:08:31,000
by the person he's talking to.

161
0:08:32.044,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We speak differently.

162
0:08:36.934,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language.

163
0:08:43.854,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Introverts prefer -- and I must again tell you

164
0:08:47.672,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine --

165
0:08:52.853,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we speak differently.

166
0:08:54.594,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We prefer contextually complex,

167
0:08:58.613,000 --> 0:08:59,000
contingent,

168
0:09:00.569,000 --> 0:09:02,000
weasel-word sentences --

169
0:09:02.609,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:03.656,000 --> 0:09:04,000
More or less.

171
0:09:05.385,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:06.845,000 --> 0:09:07,000
As it were.

173
0:09:08.069,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:09.108,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Not to put too fine a point upon it --

175
0:09:11.848,000 --> 0:09:12,000
like that.

176
0:09:13.955,000 --> 0:09:14,000
When we talk,

177
0:09:15.381,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we sometimes talk past each other.

178
0:09:17.724,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague

179
0:09:20.376,000 --> 0:09:23,000
who's as different from me as two people can possibly be.

180
0:09:23.739,000 --> 0:09:24,000
First, his name is Tom.

181
0:09:26.499,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Mine isn't.

182
0:09:27.737,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:29.032,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Secondly, he's six foot five.

184
0:09:30.987,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I have a tendency not to be.

185
0:09:32.963,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:34.03,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find.

187
0:09:37.777,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I am seriously introverted.

188
0:09:40.67,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I overload so much,

189
0:09:42.389,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon

190
0:09:47.227,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and expect to sleep in the evening.

191
0:09:50.178,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael.

192
0:09:55.32,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt.

193
0:10:00.528,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me,

194
0:10:05.244,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"What do you make of Michael?"

195
0:10:06.727,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.

196
0:10:09.021,000 --> 0:10:11,000
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."

197
0:10:11.955,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said,

198
0:10:15.554,000 --> 0:10:16,000
which is actually pretty accurate.

199
0:10:17.531,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times

200
0:10:22.385,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of behaving in a way that some of us might see

201
0:10:26.489,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."

202
0:10:30.941,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

203
0:10:33.611,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Tom rolled his eyes and he said,

204
0:10:35.412,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"Brian, that's what I said:

205
0:10:38.629,000 --> 0:10:39,000
he's an asshole!"

206
0:10:40.053,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:42.254,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause)

208
0:10:45.509,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, as an introvert,

209
0:10:46.8,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities

210
0:10:52.005,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in this man's behavior,

211
0:10:53.324,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.

212
0:10:56.152,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:59.228,000 --> 0:11:,000
But the extrovert says,

214
0:11:00.518,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."

215
0:11:03.416,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And we go past each other.

216
0:11:05.498,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now is this something that we should be heedful of?

217
0:11:09.488,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Of course.

218
0:11:10.678,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's important that we know this.

219
0:11:12.286,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Is that all we are?

220
0:11:14.67,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Are we just a bunch of traits?

221
0:11:17.563,000 --> 0:11:18,000
No, we're not.

222
0:11:20.116,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Remember, you're like some other people

223
0:11:23.266,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and like no other person.

224
0:11:25.487,000 --> 0:11:27,000
How about that idiosyncratic you?

225
0:11:28.485,000 --> 0:11:31,000
As Elizabeth or as George,

226
0:11:31.76,000 --> 0:11:33,000
you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism.

227
0:11:36.251,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior,

228
0:11:40.282,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or Georgian of yours,

229
0:11:43.732,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits?

230
0:11:48.24,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That make us love you?

231
0:11:51.461,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Not just because you're a certain type of person.

232
0:11:55.188,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.

233
0:11:59.081,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.

234
0:12:03.235,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So what is it that makes us different?

235
0:12:06.004,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's the doings that we have in our life -- the personal projects.

236
0:12:11.403,000 --> 0:12:12,000
You have a personal project right now,

237
0:12:13.248,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but nobody may know it here.

238
0:12:17.504,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It relates to your kid --

239
0:12:19.336,000 --> 0:12:21,000
you've been back three times to the hospital,

240
0:12:21.56,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and they still don't know what's wrong.

241
0:12:25.373,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Or it could be your mom.

242
0:12:28.092,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And you'd been acting out of character.

243
0:12:30.218,000 --> 0:12:31,000
These are free traits.

244
0:12:33.521,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably

245
0:12:36.625,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor

246
0:12:40.522,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in the hospital,

247
0:12:41.697,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to get something for your mom or your child.

248
0:12:45.814,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What are these free traits?

249
0:12:47.345,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They're where we enact a script

250
0:12:49.939,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in order to advance a core project in our lives.

251
0:12:53.744,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And they are what matters.

252
0:12:55.826,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Don't ask people what type you are;

253
0:12:58.742,000 --> 0:13:,000
ask them, "What are your core projects in your life?"

254
0:13:01.52,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And we enact those free traits.

255
0:13:03.328,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I'm an introvert,

256
0:13:04.667,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but I have a core project, which is to profess.

257
0:13:09.64,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I'm a professor.

258
0:13:11.798,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And I adore my students,

259
0:13:15.08,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and I adore my field.

260
0:13:16.691,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting,

261
0:13:23.366,000 --> 0:13:25,000
what I can't wait to tell them about.

262
0:13:25.642,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so I act in an extroverted way,

263
0:13:27.486,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because at eight in the morning,

264
0:13:29.038,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the students need a little bit of humor,

265
0:13:31.406,000 --> 0:13:33,000
a little bit of engagement to keep them going

266
0:13:34.152,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in arduous days of study.

267
0:13:36.277,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But we need to be very careful

268
0:13:38.456,000 --> 0:13:4,000
when we act protractedly out of character.

269
0:13:42.679,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.

270
0:13:49.309,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior,

271
0:13:53.947,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I need to repair somewhere on my own.

272
0:13:57.916,000 --> 0:14:,000
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,

273
0:14:01.059,000 --> 0:14:03,000
in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor

274
0:14:04.055,000 --> 0:14:05,000
who was teaching at the time at Harvard,

275
0:14:07.145,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I sometimes go to the men's room

276
0:14:08.829,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts.

277
0:14:13.069,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Laughter)

278
0:14:14.177,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle,

279
0:14:20.573,000 --> 0:14:21,000
trying to avoid overstimulation.

280
0:14:23.117,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And a real extrovert came in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,

281
0:14:28.388,000 --> 0:14:29,000
but in the next cubicle over --

282
0:14:30.367,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and I could hear various evacuatory noises,

283
0:14:32.714,000 --> 0:14:34,000
which we hate -- even our own,

284
0:14:35.007,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that's why we flush during as well as after.

285
0:14:37.761,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Laughter)

286
0:14:40.36,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And then I heard this gravelly voice saying,

287
0:14:44.974,000 --> 0:14:46,000
"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"

288
0:14:47.433,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:50.664,000 --> 0:14:56,000
If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months,

290
0:14:57.055,000 --> 0:14:58,000
it's talking on the john.

291
0:14:58.84,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

292
0:15:00.094,000 --> 0:15:02,000
That's where I'm going now.

293
0:15:02.696,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Don't follow me.

294
0:15:04.564,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Thank you.

295
0:15:05.767,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)
